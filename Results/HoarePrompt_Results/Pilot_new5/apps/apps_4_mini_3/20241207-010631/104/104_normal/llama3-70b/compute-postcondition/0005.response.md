Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, max_erase` is 0. The integers in `a` from index `i` to `j` form a consecutive sequence, such that `a[j] - a[i] == j - i`, which currently means that `a[1] - a[0] == 1`.***
