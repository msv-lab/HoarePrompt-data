The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The variable `n` can take any integer value within the specified range of 1 to 100, but its exact new value is determined by user input. The list `a` remains unaffected in this step as it hasn't been initialized or modified. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, and `n` is now an input integer.**
