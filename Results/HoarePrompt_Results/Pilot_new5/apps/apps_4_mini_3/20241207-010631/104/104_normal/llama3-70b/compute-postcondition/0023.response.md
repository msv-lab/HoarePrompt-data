According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `n` is at least 3. 

In the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4. 

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4**
