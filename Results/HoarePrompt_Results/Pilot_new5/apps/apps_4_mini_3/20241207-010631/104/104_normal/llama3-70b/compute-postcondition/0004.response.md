To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the state variables involved: `n`, `i`, and `j`.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):`. 
2. The starting point of the loop is `i + 1` which, given that `i` is 0, evaluates to `1`.
3. The ending point of the loop is `n + 1`, which means the loop will execute for values of `j` from `1` to `n`.

Next, let's examine the conditions:

- Since `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, the value of `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to start executing.
- Given that `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals `1`. Thus, the loop will iterate starting from `j = 1`.

Now, we can conclude that the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least `1`, which it is according to the provided state. 

The state after these considerations should reflect that:
- `j` will start at `1`.
- The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `1`.

Thus, we summarize the necessary states:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, max_erase` is 0**
