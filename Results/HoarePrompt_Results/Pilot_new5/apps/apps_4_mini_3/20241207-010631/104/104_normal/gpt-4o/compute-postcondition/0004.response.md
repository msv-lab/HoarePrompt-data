To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact on the variables based on the initial state and the operation being performed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000
- `max_erase` is 0

### Code Snippet:
```
max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. `i` is given as 1, which allows us to access `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` (i.e., `a[1]` and `a[0]`).
2. The expression `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` calculates the difference between the two consecutive elements in the list `a` and subtracts 1 from that difference.
3. `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and the calculated difference.
4. The value of `max_erase` will now reflect either 0 or the calculated difference `a[1] - a[0] - 1`.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `max_erase` will be updated based on the contents of the list `a`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains at least two integers.
- Other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1)**
