The code computes the `digit_sum` as the sum of the digits of `i`. The current value of `i` is 3, so we need to calculate the sum of the digits of 3. 

The digit sum calculation is as follows:
- Convert `i` (which is 3) to a string: `'3'`
- Iterate over each character in the string and convert it back to an integer.
- The sum of the digits: `3`

Now the updated value of `digit_sum` will be 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2, `i` is 3, and `digit_sum` is 3.**
