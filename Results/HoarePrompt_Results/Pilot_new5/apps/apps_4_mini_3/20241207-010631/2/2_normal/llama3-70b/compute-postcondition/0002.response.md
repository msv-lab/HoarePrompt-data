The variable `max_num` is initialized to 0. The values of `x` and `max_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `max_num` while retaining the original states of `x` and `max_sum`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0; `max_num` is 0.**
