`digit_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the digits of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `str(i)` converts it to the string "2", and `int(digit)` for each digit in "2" results in an integer value of 2. Therefore, `digit_sum` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 1, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2**
