`max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`, which is currently 2. The values for `max_num`, `i`, and `digit_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 1, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 1, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2**.
