`max_games` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`, which calculates the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary and subtracts 1 from that value. Since `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `n.bit_length()` will yield a value between 2 and 60 (as \(2^{60} > 10^{18}\)). Therefore, the possible values of `max_games` will be from 1 to 59. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^18; `max_games` is an integer such that 1 <= `max_games` <= 59.**
