The variable `queue` is assigned a new value which is a deque (double-ended queue) initialized with a list containing the value of `start`. The variable `start` remains unchanged, but `queue` now holds a deque that includes the string representation of the tiles and the empty position in the sliding puzzle grid.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `queue` is a deque containing `start`.**
