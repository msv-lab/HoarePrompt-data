Postcondition: ***`puzzle1` is a 2D list (or tuple) containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `puzzle2` is a 2D list (or tuple) containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `i` is 0; if the current value of `puzzle1[i]` is 'X', then `x1` is set to 0. The current value of `puzzle2[i]` is 'X'.***
