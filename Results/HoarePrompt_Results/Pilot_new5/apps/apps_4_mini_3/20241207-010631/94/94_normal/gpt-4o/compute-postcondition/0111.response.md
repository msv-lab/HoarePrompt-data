Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `directions` must have at least 2 elements; the current index in `directions` is 1; `new_row`, `new_col`, are assigned based on `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` has had the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is the concatenation of the elements in `new_state`; if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now includes `new_state_str` and `queue` includes `new_state_str`.***
