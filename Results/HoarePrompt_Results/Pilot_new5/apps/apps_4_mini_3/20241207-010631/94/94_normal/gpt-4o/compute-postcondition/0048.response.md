The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which creates a new list that is a copy of the elements in `current`. This operation does not change any other variables or their states. Thus, the output state will reflect the fact that `new_state` is now a list comprising the same characters as `current`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start`; `queue` is not empty; `current` is assigned the first element from `queue'; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `directions` is not empty; `new_state` is a list that is a copy of `current`.**
