The code snippet uses the `divmod` function to calculate the quotient and remainder of `empty_pos` when divided by `2`. The initial value of `empty_pos` is `3`. Therefore, `divmod(3, 2)` calculates how many times `2` fits into `3` (which is `1`), and what remains (which is `1`). 

Consequently, `empty_row` will be assigned the value `1` and `empty_col` will be assigned the value `1`.

The other variables (`start`, `queue`, `visited`, `current`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1**.
