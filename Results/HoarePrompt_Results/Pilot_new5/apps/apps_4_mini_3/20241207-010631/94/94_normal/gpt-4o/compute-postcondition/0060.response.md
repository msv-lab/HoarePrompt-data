The code swaps the positions of the empty space (represented by 'X') and another character in the list `new_state`. The specific positions involved in the swap are `empty_pos` (the index of 'X' in `current`) and `new_pos` (the index determined by the new row and column based on the transition defined by `dr` and `dc`).

1. `new_state` is a list representation of `current`. 
2. The values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state` are exchanged, affecting the arrangement of characters in `new_state`.

Since the other variables remain unchanged, we denote the new arrangement of `new_state` after the swap.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start`; `queue` is not empty and contains `new_state_str`; `current` is the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is the list representation of `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
