According to the code, the loop will execute for 4 iterations (from 0 to 3) based on the range defined in the `for` statement. The variable `i` is the loop index that increases by 1 in each iteration starting from 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be 3.

Since the loop runs over the range of 4, after `i` has reached 3, it cannot execute again because the next value of `i` would be 4, which exceeds the range.

To summarize:
- At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be 4, which is out of the specified range (0 to 3).

Thus, the relevant states need to reflect that the loop cannot continue executing, so we maintain the current state without needing to modify `i`, as it cannot enter another iteration.

State: **`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists (or tuples) containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `i` is 4; `x2` remains unchanged**.
