The variable `current` is equal to `start`, which is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'). The operation `current.index('X')` finds the index of the character 'X' in the string `current`. Given the structure of `start`, the index of 'X' will be 3, since 'X' is the last character in the string.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3.**
