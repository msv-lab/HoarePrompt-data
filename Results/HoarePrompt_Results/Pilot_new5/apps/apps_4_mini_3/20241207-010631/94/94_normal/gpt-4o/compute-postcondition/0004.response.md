The code `current = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the `queue`, which initially contains `start`. Therefore, `current` is assigned the value `start`, and `queue` will be empty after this operation. The `visited` set remains unchanged as it still contains `start`. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `current` is equal to `start`.**
