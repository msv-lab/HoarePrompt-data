The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. Since `visited` initially includes all unique permutations of `start` plus `new_state_str`, the addition of `new_state_str` may or may not change the size of `visited` depending on whether `new_state_str` is already present. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` plus `new_state_str`; `queue` includes the previous states plus `new_state_str`; `visited` is updated to include `new_state_str`.**
