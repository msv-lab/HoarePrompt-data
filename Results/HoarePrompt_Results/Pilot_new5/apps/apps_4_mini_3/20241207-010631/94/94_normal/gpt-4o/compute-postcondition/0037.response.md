Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `new_row` is between 0 and 1; `new_col` is between 0 and 1; `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the characters in `new_state`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now includes `new_state_str` and `queue` now includes `new_state_str`. Otherwise, there are no changes to `visited` or `queue`.***
