In the given code, `x1` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 4, so `x1` becomes 4. The other variables, including `puzzle1`, `puzzle2`, and `x2`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes all initial states of the variables with the updated value of `x1`.

Output State: **`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists (or tuples) containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `i` is 4; `x1` is 4; `x2` remains unchanged**.
