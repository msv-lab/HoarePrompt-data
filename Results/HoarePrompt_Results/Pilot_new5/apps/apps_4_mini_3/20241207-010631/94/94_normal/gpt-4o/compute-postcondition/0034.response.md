The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value created by joining the list `new_state` into a string. The output of this operation will depend on the specific contents of `new_state`, which consists of swapped positions of the original values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The values of `start`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged. 

Assuming `new_state` reflects the swapped values derived from `start`, the resulting string `new_state_str` will be a modified version of `start`, depending on the indices of the characters that were swapped.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `new_row` is between 0 and 1; `new_col` is between 0 and 1; `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the characters in `new_state`.**
