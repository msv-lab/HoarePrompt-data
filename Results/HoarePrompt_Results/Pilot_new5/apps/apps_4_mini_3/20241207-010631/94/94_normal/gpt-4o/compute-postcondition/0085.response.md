The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which creates a new list from the `current` string. Since `current` is a string of characters in `start`, `new_state` will be a list that contains the same characters as `current`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space; `queue` must contain at least 1 state; `current` is the first element removed from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `directions` must not be empty; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list containing the characters of `current`.**
