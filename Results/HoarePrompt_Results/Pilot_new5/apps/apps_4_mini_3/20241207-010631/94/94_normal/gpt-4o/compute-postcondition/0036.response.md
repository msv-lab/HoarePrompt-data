The code appends the value of `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The variables `start`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `visited` remain unchanged, but the `queue` now includes `new_state_str`. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `new_row` is between 0 and 1; `new_col` is between 0 and 1; `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the characters in `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.**
