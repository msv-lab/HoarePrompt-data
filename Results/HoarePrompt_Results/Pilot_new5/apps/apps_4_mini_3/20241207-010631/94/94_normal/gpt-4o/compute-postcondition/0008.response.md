In the provided code snippet, `new_row` and `new_col` are assigned values based on the current `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the first elements (`dr`, `dc`) of the `directions`. Since `empty_row` is equal to 1 and `empty_col` is equal to 1, the new values for `new_row` and `new_col` will depend on `dr` and `dc`.

The impact of the code is as follows:
- `new_row` will be calculated as `1 + dr`
- `new_col` will be calculated as `1 + dc`
- The values of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `current`, `empty_pos`, and the `directions` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State will include the updated values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the specific values of `dr` and `dc`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'), `queue` is empty, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is equal to `1 + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`, and `directions` must not be empty.**
