Postcondition: ***`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists (or tuples) containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. If `puzzle2[i]` is 'X', then `x1` remains unchanged (if it was originally set to 4, it stays 4) and `x2` is set to `i`. If `puzzle2[i]` is not 'X', the value of `x1` remains unchanged, and `x2` also remains unchanged.***
