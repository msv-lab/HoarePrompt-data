According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. The loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start`, and `queue` contains strings that represent unique states. If no moves were possible, then `queue` would be empty, and the loop would not execute again. 

Since it is stated that if no moves were possible, `visited` remains just as `start` and `queue` stays empty, for the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must contain at least one string representing a state. Therefore, the state of `queue` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space, and `queue` must not be empty.**
