Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'). If `new_row` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and `new_col` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive), then if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains 'ABCX', and `visited` includes both `start` and 'ABCX'; otherwise, there is no change to the state of `queue`, `visited`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `directions`, or `new_pos`.***
