The `visited` set is updated to include `new_state_str`. The other variables remain unchanged as the operation only modifies the `visited` set. Therefore, the output state is: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` now includes `new_state_str` along with all its previous unique permutations; `queue` is not empty and contains `new_state_str`; `current` is the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining `new_state`.
