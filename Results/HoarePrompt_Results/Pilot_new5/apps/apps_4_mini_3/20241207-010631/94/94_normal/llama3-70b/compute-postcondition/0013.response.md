The variable `x1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 4. Therefore, after this assignment, `x1` will now hold the value 4. The values of `puzzle1`, `puzzle2`, `x2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists (or tuples) containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `x1` is 4; `x2` remains unchanged; `i` is 4**
