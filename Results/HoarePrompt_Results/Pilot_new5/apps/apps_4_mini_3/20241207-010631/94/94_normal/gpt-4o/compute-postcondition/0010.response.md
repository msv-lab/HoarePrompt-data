The value of `new_pos` is assigned the result of the expression `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The current values of `new_row` and `new_col` are within the range of 0 to 1 (inclusive), which means they can either be 0 or 1.

Thus, the possible values for `new_pos` can be calculated as follows:
- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 0: `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 0 = 0`
- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1: `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 0: `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 0 = 2`
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 1: `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 1 = 3`

Therefore, `new_pos` can take on the values 0, 1, 2, or 3.

The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'), `queue` is empty, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is equal to `1 + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`, `directions` is not empty, and `new_pos` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.**
