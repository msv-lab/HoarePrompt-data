The code snippet swaps the elements in the `new_state` list at the positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. However, the values of `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are unknown based on the provided initial state. 

Since the initial state is `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X'], and without any specific values for `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, we cannot determine the exact outcome of the swap.

Therefore, the output state will retain the information about `start` and `new_state`, but we acknowledge that the positions to be swapped are unknown.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X'] with elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
