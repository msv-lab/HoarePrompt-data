Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, and `count` is the sum of counts where `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)`. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns True.***
