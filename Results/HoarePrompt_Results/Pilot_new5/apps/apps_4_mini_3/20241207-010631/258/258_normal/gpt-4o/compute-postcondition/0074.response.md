Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `x1` is assigned the first value of `meats[i]`, `y1` is assigned the second value of `meats[i]`, `c1` is assigned the third value of `meats[i]`, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`, `x2` is assigned the first value of `meats[j]`, `y2` is assigned the second value of `meats[j]`, `c2` is assigned the third value of `meats[j]`, and the current value of `c1 * T` is less than the current value of `c2 * T`.***
