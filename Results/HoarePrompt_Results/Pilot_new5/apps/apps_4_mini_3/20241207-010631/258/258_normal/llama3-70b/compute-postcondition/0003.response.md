The code assigns the result of the function `func_2` to the variable `times`, where the arguments passed are `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are both initialized to -1000, the function will be executed based on these values. The output of `func_2` is not specified, so we will refer to it as `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)` for clarity.

The variables `N`, `K`, and `ans` remain unaffected by this assignment, while `times` will be assigned whatever value `func_2` computes.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -1000; `ans` is positive infinity; `times` is equal to `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000`.**
