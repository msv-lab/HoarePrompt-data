The line of code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` assigns the result of the function `func_2` called with the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y` to the variable `times`. The values of `x` and `y` are -1000 and -999 respectively, so the arguments are -1000, -999, -1000, and -999. 

The variable `ans` is defined as `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`, but since `times` is being assigned the result of `func_2`, we don't have the final value of `times` until `func_2` executes.

The output state would therefore include the reassignment of `times`, while `N`, `K`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged at this point.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -999; `times` is equal to `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`; `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`.**
