The variable `index` is incremented by 3. The values of the other variables (`N`, `K`, and `meats`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `index` has been updated while keeping the other preconditions intact. Therefore, the Output State will be: 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 6; `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`; `meats` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x, y, c)`; `index` is incremented by 3.**
