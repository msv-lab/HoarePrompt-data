To calculate `d2`, we assign it the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Given that `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, we can express `d2` as:

```
d2 = ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)
```

This simplifies to:

```
d2 = (1/4) * ((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)
```

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the calculated value of `d2` based on `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `(1/4) * ((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)`**.
