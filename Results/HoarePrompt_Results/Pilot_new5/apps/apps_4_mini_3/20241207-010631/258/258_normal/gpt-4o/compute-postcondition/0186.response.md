According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `N`. The loop begins at `j = i + 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `N`. This means that `i + 1` must be less than `N`, or equivalently, `i` must be less than `N - 1`. 

Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `i + 2`. 

State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the number of elements in `meats` satisfying the condition, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `N` must be greater than `i + 2**
