The code is a `continue` statement, which will skip the current iteration of the closest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there are no specific variables being changed or assigned new values in this code snippet, and given that the values of other variables are not affected, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)` if `d` is not negative; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
