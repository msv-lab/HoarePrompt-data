The variable `meats` is an empty list initially. The code appends a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are assigned from `int(data[2])`, `int(data[3])`, and `int(data[4])`, respectively. The initial state of `N`, `K`, and `index` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

After executing the code, the `meats` list will contain one tuple consisting of the values of `x`, `y`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `meats` list.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 2, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[2])`, `y` is assigned the value `int(data[3])`, `c` is assigned the value `int(data[4])`.**
