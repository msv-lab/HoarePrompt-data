The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` have been previously defined as `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `(y1 - y2) / 2`, respectively. Therefore, `d2` will be calculated using these expressions.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`

Thus, using these expressions:
- `d2` becomes `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, which simplifies to:
- `d2 = (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)` if `d` is not negative; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`.**
