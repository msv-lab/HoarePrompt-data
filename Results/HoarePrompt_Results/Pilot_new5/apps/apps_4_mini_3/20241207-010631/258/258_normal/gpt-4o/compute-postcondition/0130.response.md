To determine the output state after executing the given code, we analyze the impact of the code snippet on the defined variables.

The code snippet calculates `d2` as the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. The variables `dx` and `dy` are defined as:

- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`

Thus, `d2` will be:

```
d2 = ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)
```

This can be simplified as:

```
d2 = ((x1 - x2) ** 2) / 4 + ((y1 - y2) ** 2) / 4
```

The value of `d2` is now dependent on the variables `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`, but the values of the other initial variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing this line of code, we have calculated `d2` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples; `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) ** 2) / 4 + ((y1 - y2) ** 2) / 4`.**
