The variable `times` is sorted in ascending order. The previous value of `times` is not specified, but it is stated that `times` must have at least `K` elements. The output will reflect that `times` has been sorted, but without specific previous values, we cannot indicate what those values are now. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `times` is sorted in ascending order, and `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` for all iterations.**
