Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `count` is greater than or equal to `K` if the distance condition is satisfied during the iterations; otherwise, `count` is less than `K`. `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` are calculated values based on the comparisons within the loop; `mx` and `my` are calculated based on the last valid `d`, `cx`, and `cy` values. If `N` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, leaving `count`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` undefined or at their initial state.**
