According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000, which gives a total of 2001 iterations (from -1000 to 1000 inclusive). The variable `y` is initialized at -1000 at the start of the loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. Since the loop increments `y` by 1 for each iteration, it will be incremented to -999 for the next iteration. The loop will continue executing until `y` reaches 1000. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` should be -999. The conditions set for `N` and `K` do not impact the loop's execution, as they are not directly involved in controlling the loop's bounds.

State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -999; `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`; `times` is equal to `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**
