Output State: **`N` must be greater than 6; `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`; `meats` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x, y, c)` where `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `y` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `c` is now assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`; `meats` now includes the new tuple `(x, y, c)`.**
