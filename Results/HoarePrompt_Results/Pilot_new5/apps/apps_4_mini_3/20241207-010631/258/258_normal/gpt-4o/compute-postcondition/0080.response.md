Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, and `j` is `k + 1`. If `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T` and is less than 0, the loop will skip the rest of the current iteration. If the condition does not hold, `d` retains its original value.***
