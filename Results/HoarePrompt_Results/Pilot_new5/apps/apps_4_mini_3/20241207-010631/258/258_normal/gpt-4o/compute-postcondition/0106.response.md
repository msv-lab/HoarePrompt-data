The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The values of `y1` and `y2` are implicitly assumed to be present and valid for this calculation. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of `c` for each tuple `(x, y, c)` and is less than `K`, `d` is less than 0, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of `c` for each tuple `(x, y, c)` and is less than `K`, `d` is less than 0, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
