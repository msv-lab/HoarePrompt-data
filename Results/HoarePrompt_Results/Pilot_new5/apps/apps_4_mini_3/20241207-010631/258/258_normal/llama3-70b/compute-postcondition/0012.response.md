The variable `times` is a list that holds the result of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `x` is -1000 and `y` is -998. The code snippet provided sorts the `times` list in place. `K` is an integer between 1 and `N`, meaning `K - 1` is a valid index for the sorted `times` list. The value of `ans` is set to the `K - 1` indexed value of the sorted list `times`.

After executing the code, the `times` list has been sorted, but the exact values in it depend on the output of `func_2`. The value of `K` determines which index is accessed in the sorted `times`. 

Thus, summarizing the impact on the state:
- The variable `times` is now sorted.
- The variable `ans` is updated to the sorted value of `times[K - 1]`.

The states of the variables `N`, `K`, `x`, `y`, and the method `func_2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -998; `times` is sorted; `ans` is equal to the sorted value of `times[K - 1]**
