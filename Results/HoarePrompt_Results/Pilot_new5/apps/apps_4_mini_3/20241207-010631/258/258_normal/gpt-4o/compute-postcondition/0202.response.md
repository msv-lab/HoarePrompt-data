The code assigns a value to `mx` based on the expression `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. It assumes that `d2` is not zero to avoid division by zero. The values of `cx`, `dy`, `d`, and `d2` will directly affect the calculation of `mx`. If `d` is less than 0, the loop iteration is skipped, and `mx` will not be calculated. The initial state of `meats` remains unchanged if the condition `d * d2 > d2` holds true. 

Since we haven't received any specific values for `cx`, `dy`, `d`, and `d2`, we will represent `mx` based on the given formula. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2,` provided `d` is not less than 0.**
