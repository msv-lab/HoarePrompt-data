The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are affected by this command, it simply means that the execution will skip the remaining lines of the loop for the current iteration.

In this case, the values of `meats` and `d` remain unchanged, as the `continue` statement does not modify them or affect their state.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
