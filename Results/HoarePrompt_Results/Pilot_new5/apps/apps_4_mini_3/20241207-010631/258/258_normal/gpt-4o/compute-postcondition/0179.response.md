The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the closest enclosing loop to be skipped, and control moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, in this case, there is no specific loop context provided before the `continue`. Thus, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but we note that we would have skipped further processing in the current iteration.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is based on the valid weights from `meats` and must be less than K, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is now equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)` and remains negative if `d < 0, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
