Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain defined, `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `count` is the sum of values satisfying the condition based on `mx`, `my`, `T`, and the elements of `meats`. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True. Otherwise, there is no alternative action specified.***
