`times` is sorted in ascending order. The initial values of `times` are unknown since they depend on the return value of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`. After sorting, `times` will have its values in increasing order, but the specific values are not provided. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `times` is sorted, `ans` is now the minimum of the sorted values of `times`.**
