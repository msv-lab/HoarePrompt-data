Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain defined; if `d` is less than 0, then `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of values satisfying the condition based on `mx`, `my`, `T`, and the elements of `meats`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, and `d` is updated to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, followed by the execution of the next iteration of the loop. If `d` is not less than 0, no operation occurs within the if block.***
