The variable `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned the values from the tuple `meats[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is such that `N` is greater than `i + 1`, indicating that the assignment is valid.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`; `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the respective values from `meats[i]`; `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to ((x1 - x2) / 2); `mx` is equal to `cx`; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `count` is calculated as the sum of weights where the distance condition is met, and `count` is less than K; `j` is `i + 2`.**
