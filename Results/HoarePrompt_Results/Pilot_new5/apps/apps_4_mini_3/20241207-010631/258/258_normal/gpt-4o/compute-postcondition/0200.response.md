The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration without changing any of the variable values. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same, and no new calculations are made.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `d` is equal to (c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2) if d is less than 0, we skip to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`.**
