To analyze the provided code, we'll break it down step by step:

1. The variable `count` is calculated using a generator expression that iterates over the `meats` list, which consists of tuples. Each tuple can be represented as `(x, y, c)`, where `x` and `y` are coordinates and `c` is a corresponding value.

2. The expression within the `sum` function checks if the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T` holds true for each tuple in `meats`.

3. The variables `mx` and `my` are defined in the initial state:
   - `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`
   - `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`

4. The output will depend on the values of `mx`, `my`, and the tuples in `meats`, as well as the variable `T`. However, since we do not have specific values for `meats`, `T`, or the variables used to compute `mx` and `my`, we can only describe the effect in general terms.

5. The variable `count` will hold the sum of counts where the condition holds true, which will be an integer value based on the number of tuples fulfilling the condition.

Given the analysis, the output state captures the state of the variables affected by the code.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `count` is the sum of counts where `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats`.**
