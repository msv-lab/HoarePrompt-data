Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not optimally determine the best coordinates for the heat source (X, Y) to minimize the time required to grill K pieces of meat. The main issues are:

1. **Brute Force Limitation**: The program uses a brute force approach by iterating through every integer coordinate from -1000 to 1000 for both X and Y. This method could miss optimal positions that are real numbers (floating-point) between the integer coordinates. Hence, the minimum time may not be found as the best position for the heat source could be a non-integer value that falls between these integers.

2. **Edge Cases with Non-Integer Coordinates**: The problem states that X and Y can be any real numbers, but the program restricts the search to integer values only. As a result, cases where the optimal heat source position is not at an integer coordinate will not be correctly evaluated.

3. **K-th Piece of Meat**: There is a risk when sorting the computed times and selecting the K-th minimum. If the times are not accurately calculated (due to the issues above), the K-th piece of meat readiness time could be incorrect.

Through these limitations, the program may not yield the correct result for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement. Hence, it fails to meet the requirements of the original problem in all scenarios.
