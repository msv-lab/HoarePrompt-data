You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
Annotated Functions:
import math

(N, K) = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    (x, y, c) = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
print(func_3())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, X, and Y are real numbers representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y) in the two-dimensional plane
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four real numbers, x, y, X, and Y, representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane, and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y). There are no edge cases handled in this function, as it will correctly compute the distance for any real number inputs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the coordinates of the heat source, X and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates where the heat source is placed.
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list of values obtained by multiplying each coefficient 'c' from 'meats' with the result of the function 'func_1' applied to the coordinates (x, y) and (X, Y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the coordinates of a heat source, and two real number parameters `X` and `Y`, which are the coordinates where the heat source is placed. It returns a list of values, where each value is the product of a coefficient `c` from `meats` and the result of calling the function `func_1` with the arguments (x, y, X, Y). The behavior of the function depends on the definition of `func_1` and the contents of the `meats` variable. It assumes that `meats` is defined in the scope where this function is called and has a structure that allows for unpacking into `x`, `y`, and `c`. If `meats` is not defined or does not have the expected structure, it will raise an error during execution.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, K is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, x and y are integers within the range -1000 to 1000.
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is 1000; `y` is 1000; `ans` is equal to the minimum of the sorted values of `times` computed by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` across all combinations of `x` and `y` from -1000 to 1000; `times` contains the results of `func_2` for each combination of `x` and `y`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value of the sorted results stored in 'times', which are computed by 'func_2(x, y, x, y)' across all combinations of 'x' and 'y' from -1000 to 1000. The variable 'ans' holds this minimum value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns the minimum value from the K-th sorted results computed by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for all integer combinations of `x` and `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000. The function assumes `K` is within a valid range (1 to N) without any checks for its correctness, which could lead to potential errors if `K` exceeds the size of the results returned by `func_2`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
