In the given situation, the impact of the code line `x = int(data[index])` is that the variable `x` is assigned a new value which is derived from `data` at the position specified by `index`. Previously, `x` had a value assigned from `int(data[2])`. The `index` is currently 6, meaning `x` will now take the value of `int(data[6])`.

The current values of the variables are:
- `N` must be greater than 5
- `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`
- `meats` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`
- `index` is 6
- `y` is assigned the value `int(data[3])`
- `c` is assigned the value `int(data[4])`

Now, after executing the code:
- `x` is updated to the value `int(data[6])`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 5, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 6, `y` is assigned the value `int(data[3])`, `c` is assigned the value `int(data[4])`, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[6])`.**
