The code assigns the result of the function `func_2` to the variable `result`, which is computed based on the current values of `N`, `K`, and `meats`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged, and `result` will hold the output of the function call.

Output State: **`N` is the total number of iterations executed by the loop, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing `N` tuples of the form `(x, y, c)`, `index` is `2 + 3N`, and `result` is equal to `func_2(N, K, meats)`**.
