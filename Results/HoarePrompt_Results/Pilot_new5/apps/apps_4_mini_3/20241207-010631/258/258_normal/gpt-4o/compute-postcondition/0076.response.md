Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` respectively, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`. The conditions state that `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, and `j` is `k + 1`, while also maintaining that `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`.***
