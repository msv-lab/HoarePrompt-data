The variable `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be greater than 5, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x, y, c)` where `y` is `int(data[7])`, `x` is `int(data[6])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`, and `index` is increased by 3.
