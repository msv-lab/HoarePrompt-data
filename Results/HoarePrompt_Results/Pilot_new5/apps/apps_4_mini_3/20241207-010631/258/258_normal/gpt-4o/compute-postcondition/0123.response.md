The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that the flow of the program is redirected without affecting the values of the variables directly. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the overall state of the variables remains unchanged, except that the code following the `continue` within the current iteration is not executed.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples; `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
