To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we analyze the impact of the code on the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60
- `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -1000
- `ans` is equal to the minimum of the sorted values of `times` computed across all iterations

Now, we look at the code:
```
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

In this line, the variable `times` is assigned the value from the function `func_2` which takes `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y` as arguments. These arguments are just the current values of `x` and `y`, which are -999 and -1000, respectively.

The function `func_2` likely computes some values based on `x` and `y`, resulting in a list or sequence of values that will be assigned to `times`. The exact behavior and return value of `func_2` are unknown, but it does not change the other variables (`N`, `K`, and `ans`).

After this line executes, the specific values that we know are:
- `times` is assigned some value based on `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, but we do not have enough information about the return value of `func_2` in relation to `ans` or any direct calculations.
- `x` remains -999.
- `y` remains -1000.
- The value of `ans` remains the minimum of the sorted values of `times`, but since `times` has now been calculated, `ans` can be updated accordingly.

In summary, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `times` is updated based on `func_2` while `ans` can now be calculated as the minimum of `times`, though its exact computation isn't specified in the prompt.

Output State:
**`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `times` is assigned the value from `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000), `ans` is now the minimum of the sorted values of `times`.**
