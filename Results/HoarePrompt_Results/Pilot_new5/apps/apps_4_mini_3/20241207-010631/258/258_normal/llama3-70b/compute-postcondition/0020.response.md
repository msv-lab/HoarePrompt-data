According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `y`, which starts at -1000 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1.

Thus, after the last iteration, `y` will become -999. The loop will continue executing as long as `y` is less than 1001.

State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` is -999, `y` is -999, `times` is sorted, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]**
