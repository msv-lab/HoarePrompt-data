Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are updated to `x2`, `y2`, `c2` respectively, while `x2`, `y2`, `c2` take on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`. Additionally, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to ((x1 - x2) / 2); `mx` is equal to `cx`; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; and `count` is calculated as the sum of weights where the distance condition is met, and `count` is less than K. The variable `j` is set to `i + 2`.***
