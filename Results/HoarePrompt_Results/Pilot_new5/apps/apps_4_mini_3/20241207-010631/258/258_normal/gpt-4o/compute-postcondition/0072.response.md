The variable `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned the values from the tuple `meats[i]`. The initial state indicates `meats` is a list of tuples, and since `i` is used to index this list, it implies that `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list. As such, the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` will be set to the first, second, and third elements of the tuple located at the index `i`.

The values of other variables (`d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `K`, `N`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `x1` is assigned the first value of `meats[i]`, `y1` is assigned the second value of `meats[i]`, `c1` is assigned the third value of `meats[i]`, and `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` must be less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`.**
