Initial State: `meats` is a list of tuples; `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)`.

```
d = (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)
cx = (x1 + x2) / 2
cy = (y1 + y2) / 2
dx = (x1 - x2) / 2
dy = (y1 - y2) / 2
d2 = (x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2
```

Now, please think step by step: The code assigns new values to variables based on calculations involving existing variables. The values of `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` are computed based on other defined variables. However, since the initial values of `c1`, `c2`, `T`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` are not provided in the initial state, we can only express the impact of the changes rather than specify final numeric values.

Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples; `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)`.
