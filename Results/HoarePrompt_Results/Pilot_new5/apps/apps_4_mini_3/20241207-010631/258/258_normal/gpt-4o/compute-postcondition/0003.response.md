The variable `meats` is assigned an empty list. The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged, and the list of tuples `meats` is now empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer derived from the first element of `data`, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, and `meats` is an empty list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer derived from the first element of `data`, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, `meats` is an empty list.**
