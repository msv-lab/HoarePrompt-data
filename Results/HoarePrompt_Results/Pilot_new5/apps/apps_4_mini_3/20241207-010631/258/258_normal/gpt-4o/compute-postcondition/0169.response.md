Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is based on the valid weights from `meats` and must be less than K, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1` becomes `x2`, `y1` becomes `y2`, `c1` becomes `c2`, `x2` becomes `x1`, `y2` becomes `y1`, and `c2` becomes `c1`.***
