The code assigns the value of `times` to the result of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The initial state provides information about `x`, `y`, and the bounds for `N` and `K`. However, `func_2` is not defined, and therefore we cannot determine the output of `times`. The state of `ans` is dependent on the value returned by `times[K - 1]`, which cannot be calculated without knowing the behavior of `func_2`.

Since `func_2` is not defined, the output state will only update `times` as a result of the function call, but there's no information about its value.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is the result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]**.
