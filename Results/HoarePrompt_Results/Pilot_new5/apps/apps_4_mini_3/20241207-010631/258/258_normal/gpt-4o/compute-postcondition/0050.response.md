Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain defined; `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `count` is the sum of values satisfying the condition based on `mx`, `my`, `T`, and the elements of `meats`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` must be greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`; `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`.**
