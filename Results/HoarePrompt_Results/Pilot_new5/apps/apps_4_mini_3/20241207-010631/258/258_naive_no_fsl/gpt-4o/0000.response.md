To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the code and identify potential cases where it might fail to meet the requirements.

### Key Observations:

1. **Understanding of the Problem**: The goal is to find the optimal placement for a heat source on a 2D plane such that at least K pieces of meat can be grilled in the minimum time. The time to grill each piece of meat is influenced by its hardness and the distance from the heat source.

2. **Functionality**:
   - `func_1`: This function checks whether there exists a placement of the heat source that can grill K pieces of meat within a given time T. It uses a mathematical approach to find candidate points between pairs of meat coordinates.
   - `func_2`: This function performs a binary search on the time T to minimize the grilling time by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_3`: It handles input reading, prepares the data, and invokes `func_2` to get the result.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Precision of Time Calculation**: The binary search continues until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than `1e-07`. However, the problem states that the absolute or relative error must be at most `10^{-6}`. Therefore, this precision could lead to results that do not satisfy the output requirements under certain circumstances.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not seem to handle cases where K is equal to N. Specifically, if all pieces of meat must be grilled, it is critical to ensure that the heat source is placed optimally based on all pieces of meat together, rather than pairwise comparisons which may miss an overall optimal solution.

3. **Time Calculation Logic**: The logic that uses the pair of meats to derive the `mx` and `my` positions for the heat source could miss valid configurations, particularly if they arenâ€™t directly between any two pieces of meat. This relies on geometric properties that may not cover all configurations.

### Example Case:
Consider the situation where we have only two pieces of meat positioned very far apart, with a high hardness value for one of them:
```
Input:
2 2
-1000 0 1
1000 0 100
```
In this scenario, the program might incorrectly determine that placing the heat source at the midpoint (0, 0) is optimal, resulting in suboptimal grilling times for the high-hardness piece.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues with precision and handling edge cases, it is evident that the program may not correctly compute the optimal placement in all scenarios. Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
