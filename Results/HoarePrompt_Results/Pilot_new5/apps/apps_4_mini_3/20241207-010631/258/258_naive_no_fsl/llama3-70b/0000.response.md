Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the following reasons:

1. **Inefficient Search Space**: The program uses a brute force approach by iterating over all integer coordinates in the range of -1000 to 1000 for placing the heat source. This can lead to inaccuracies because the optimal position for the heat source may not be at integer coordinates. The problem allows for real-number coordinates, and thus the optimal position could be a floating-point value in between integers.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The function `func_3` sorts the times of grilling for each piece of meat after calculating them for each heat source position. The algorithm then attempts to minimize the time required to have the K-th piece of meat ready. However, the program does not guarantee that this sorting and selection process will yield the correct minimum time since it evaluates only integer coordinates rather than the full continuous space.

3. **Potential Case of Optimal Placement**: Consider a case where the optimal point for the heat source is, for example, at (0.5, 0.5) for specific inputs. The program would never reach this point as it only checks integer coordinates. Thus, it could miss the optimal solution entirely.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem. It fails to consider that the heat source can be placed at non-integer coordinates, which could lead to a more optimal solution.
