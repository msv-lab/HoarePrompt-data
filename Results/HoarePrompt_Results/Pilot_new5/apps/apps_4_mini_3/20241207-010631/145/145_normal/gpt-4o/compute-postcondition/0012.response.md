The assignment `current_sum = 0` resets the value of `current_sum` to `0`. The other variables remain unaffected since they are not directly altered by this line of code. Therefore, `current_sum` is now explicitly defined as `0`. 

The previous state of `current_sum` was `0 + int(ticket[1])`. Since `current_sum` is being redefined, the previous computation is now disregarded.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `i` is 1**
