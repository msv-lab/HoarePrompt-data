The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of all digits in the string variable `ticket`. Since `ticket` consists of digits, `sum(ticket)` will compute the total of these digits. The length of `ticket` is specified to be between 2 and 100, and each digit is between 0 and 9. Therefore, `total_sum` will be an integer representing the sum of these digits. The state of `ticket` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length n (2 <= n <= 100), each digit is an integer between 0 and 9; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`.**
