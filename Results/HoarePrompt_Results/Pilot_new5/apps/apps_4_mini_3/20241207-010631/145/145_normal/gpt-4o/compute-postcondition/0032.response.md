The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `segment_count` is 0, so after the increment, `segment_count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `i` is 0.**
