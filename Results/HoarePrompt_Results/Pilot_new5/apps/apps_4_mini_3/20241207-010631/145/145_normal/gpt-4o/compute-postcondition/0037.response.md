The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` was increased to 1, so after this operation, `segment_count` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is 1**
