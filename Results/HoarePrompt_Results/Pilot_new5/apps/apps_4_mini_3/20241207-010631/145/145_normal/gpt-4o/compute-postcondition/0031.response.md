The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of `0`. The initial state indicates that `current_sum` is already equal to `target_sum`, but after this assignment, `current_sum` will no longer hold that value. The other variables are unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0**
