To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop execution:

1. The variable `n` is given to be between 2 and 100, which means that the loop will execute at least once (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to n-1).
2. The variable `i` is initialized at the start of the loop (`i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`).
3. The variables `current_sum` and `segment_count` do not impact the execution of the loop directly but are relevant for the loop's body logic.
4. The `target_sum` mentioned relates to a specific condition that we don't know the values of yet, but it doesn't affect the loop's ability to run.

Thus, based on the understanding of the conditions provided, the only adjustments needed for the loop to execute are that `i` should start from 0. Since `n` is already specified to be between 2 and 100, we can conclude that the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`**
