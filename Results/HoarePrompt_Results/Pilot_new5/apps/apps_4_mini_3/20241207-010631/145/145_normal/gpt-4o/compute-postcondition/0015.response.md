According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `i` which is compared against `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_count` has been increased to 2, and `i` is currently 1. 

To execute one more time, `i` will increment by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. Since `n` is between 2 and 100, it is guaranteed that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, allowing the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is equal to `target_sum`, `segment_count` is 2, and `i` is 2**
