The value of `current_sum` is updated by adding the integer value of `ticket[i]`. The variable `i` is still 0, and since the initial state does not provide the value of `ticket[0]`, we can represent the updated `current_sum` as `current_sum + int(ticket[0])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `current_sum` is `current_sum + int(ticket[0])`, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0**
