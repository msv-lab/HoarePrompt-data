The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 1, so the new value becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is 1**
