The variable `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 2, so after the increment, the new value will be 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 3, and `i` is 2.
