The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `ticket`, which consists of digits with a length between 2 and 100. It first calculates the total sum of the digits in `ticket`. If this sum is odd, the function returns `False`. If the sum is even, it calculates a target sum as half of the total sum and then iterates through the digits of `ticket`, accumulating a current sum. Whenever the current sum matches the target sum, it resets the current sum and increments a segment counter. 

Finally, the function returns `True` if there are at least two segments in `ticket` whose digit sums are equal to the target sum; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The functionality of the function includes handling the case where the total sum of digits is odd and correctly counting the segments only if the total sum is even. Notably, if the total sum of digits is even but there are fewer than two segments found during the iteration, the function will return `False`, which is also an important edge case to consider.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `ticket` of digits, returns `False` if the total sum of digits is odd, and returns `True` if there are at least two segments where each segment's sum equals half of the total sum of the digits, or `False` otherwise. **
