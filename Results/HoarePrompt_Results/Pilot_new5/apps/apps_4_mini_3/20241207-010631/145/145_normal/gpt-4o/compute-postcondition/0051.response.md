The variable `segment_count` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `segment_count` was less than or equal to `1`. Since it is being set to `0`, this is valid and does not contradict the initial state. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `current_sum` is the sum of ticket elements that were not part of any segment that equaled `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the total number of segments formed with the sum equal to `target_sum`, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`**
