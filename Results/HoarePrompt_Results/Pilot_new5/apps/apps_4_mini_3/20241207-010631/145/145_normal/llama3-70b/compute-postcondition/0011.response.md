`curr_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `curr_sum` was equal to `target_sum`. Therefore, after the execution, `curr_sum` is now `0`, while `ticket`, `digit`, `segments`, and `curr_sum`'s previous value are unchanged. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2, `digit` is the first character of `ticket`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1, and the previous value of `curr_sum` was equal to `target_sum`.**
