According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is between 2 and 100, the loop can execute because it will iterate from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `i` is initialized to `n - 1`, which means it will be adjusted to `0` before the loop starts iterating. The other variables are not directly involved in the loop execution.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the following states need to be adjusted: `i` should start at 0 and `n` must be between 2 and 100.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0**
