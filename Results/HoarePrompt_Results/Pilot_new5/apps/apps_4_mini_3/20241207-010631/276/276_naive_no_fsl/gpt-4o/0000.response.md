To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code based on the problem description and its requirements.

The program reads two strings from input, which represent numbers in a golden system notation (consisting of only '0's and '1's). It computes the decimal value of each string according to the formula given:

\[
\text{decimal value} = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}
\]

where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).

### Key points to consider:

1. **String Representation**: The function `func_1` converts the string representation into a decimal value using the golden ratio. It correctly handles the contributions of '1's to the overall value based on their position in the string.

2. **Handling Leading Zeros**: In the given problem, leading zeros should not change the value of the binary-like representation. The program handles this implicitly since the calculation `value += q ** (n - i - 1)` will correctly calculate the power based on the actual position of '1's regardless of leading zeros.

3. **Precision and Comparison**: The program uses floating-point arithmetic which can lead to precision issues especially when values are very close to each other. However, for the purposes of this problem, it appears the values will remain distinct enough due to the nature of the exponential growth of \( q^n \). 

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **All Zeros**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where both inputs could be strings of only zeros (though the problem states inputs are non-empty).
- **Comparison Precision**: If inputs are very close in value, floating-point inaccuracies might lead to incorrect comparisons. For example, two very similar numbers generated from sequences of '0's and '1's might end up being evaluated incorrectly due to precision limits.

### Test Cases:
- Input: `00001` and `1` should return `=`, but `func_1` would return 1 for both, which is correct.
- Input: `1000000000` and `1111111111`, the first should evaluate larger than the second; the calculations seem to handle this correctly.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and considering different inputs, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic for the golden system. However, there are concerns regarding floating-point precision that could cause incorrect behavior in very close comparisons.

Thus, given that there's a potential for incorrect results due to precision issues and considering the problem description, the output should be:

Correctness: **False**
