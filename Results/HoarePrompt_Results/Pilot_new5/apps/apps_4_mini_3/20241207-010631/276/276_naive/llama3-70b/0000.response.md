To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and consider potential edge cases.

The program takes two binary strings representing numbers in a "golden system" and compares their decimal values. The conversion from the golden system to decimal is done using the formula for \( q \), where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. It reads two binary strings `a` and `b`.
2. It converts both strings to their decimal representations using the `func_1` function.
3. It compares the two decimal values and prints the appropriate relational operator: '>', '<', or '='.

In the `func_1` function:
- For each bit in the string, it calculates its contribution to the decimal value based on its position (using \( q^i \)).
- The conversion is done by reversing the string so that the least significant bit corresponds to \( q^0 \).

### Potential Issues
1. **Handling of leading zeros**: The function does not explicitly handle leading zeros. For example, the strings '0001' and '1' should both represent the same value, but they may be treated differently by the comparison due to their lengths.
2. **Precision Issues**: The function uses floating-point arithmetic to calculate powers of \( q \). This may introduce precision errors, especially for large values of \( i \) (up to 100,000), where \( q^i \) can be a very large number, resulting in possible inaccuracies in comparison.

### Example Case
- Consider the inputs `000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001` (which is equal to `1`) and `1`. The program will evaluate both to different lengths, leading them to be considered different, even though they represent the same value.

### Conclusion
Due to these potential issues, especially with handling leading zeros and the potential for floating-point precision errors, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.
