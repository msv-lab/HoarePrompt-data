#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `value` is equal to the sum of `q
    return value
    #The program returns the value which is equal to the sum of q, where q is approximately 1.618033988749895
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty binary strings. It calculates a weighted sum of the digits in the first string using the golden ratio (approximately 1.618) raised to the power of the position of each '1' in the string, counting from the right (with the rightmost position being 0). The function returns this computed value. Note that while `s` is expected to be a tuple containing two strings, only the first string is used in the calculation, and the function does not handle edge cases if the strings contain characters other than '0' and '1'.
