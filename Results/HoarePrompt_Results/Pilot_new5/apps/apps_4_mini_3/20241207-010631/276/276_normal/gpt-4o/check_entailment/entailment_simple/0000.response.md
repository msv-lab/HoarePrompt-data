Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters. It uses `input().strip()` to ensure that any leading or trailing whitespace is removed, although the problem guarantees the strings are non-empty.

2. **Value Calculation**: The function `func_1(s)` calculates the decimal value of the string as per the golden system rules, which states that the decimal value of the expression \(a_0a_1...a_n\) equals \(\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n - i}\). The program achieves this by iterating over each character in the string:
   - If the character is '1', it adds \(q^{(n-i-1)}\) to the value, which is the correct contribution to the sum for that position in the string based on the golden system definition.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After calculating the values for both input strings, the program correctly compares them:
   - It prints '>' if the first value is greater, '<' if the second is greater, and '=' if both values are equal. This satisfies the output requirements as defined by the problem description.

4. **Correctness for Edge Cases**: The program accounts for edge cases, such as:
   - Different lengths of binary strings, where the string with more '1's in the higher significance places (more left) will lead to a higher decimal value, which is handled correctly by the logic of exponentiation based on the string length.

5. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough to handle input strings up to the specified length of 100,000 characters, as it processes each string in linear time relative to its length.

In conclusion, the program adheres to all specified requirements of the problem description, correctly reads input, computes the values according to the golden system, and performs the necessary comparisons. Therefore, it is correct, and the output is valid.
