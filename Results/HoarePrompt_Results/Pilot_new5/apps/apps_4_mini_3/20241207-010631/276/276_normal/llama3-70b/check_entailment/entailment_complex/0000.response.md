Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the expectations:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two lines of input, each representing a number in the "golden system" notation (a string of '0's and '1's). This aligns with the problem's input requirements.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` accurately calculates the decimal value corresponding to the golden system representation. It uses the formula \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \) and computes the value by summing \( q^i \) for all indices \( i \) where the character in the string is '1'. This is precisely what the problem description requires for computing the decimal value from the golden system.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After obtaining the decimal values of both numbers using `func_1`, the program compares the two values:
   - If the first decimal value is greater, it prints '>'.
   - If the first decimal value is smaller, it prints '<'.
   - If both values are equal, it prints '='.
   This comparison is consistent with the specified output format in the problem description.

4. **Assumptions**: The program assumes that the input strings are always valid (non-empty and consist only of '0's and '1's). The problem description does not mention invalid inputs; hence, this assumption is reasonable for the context.

Overall, the program effectively fulfills the requirements of the problem description. It calculates the decimal values using the golden ratio system and correctly compares them, yielding the required output format. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
