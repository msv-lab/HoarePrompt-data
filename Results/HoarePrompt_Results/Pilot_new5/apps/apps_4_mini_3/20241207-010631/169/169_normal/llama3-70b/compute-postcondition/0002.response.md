The code assigns the variable `minus_count` the value of the count of the character '-' in the string `s`. The value of `n` is still within the range of 1 to 100, and `s` is a string comprised of '+' and '-' characters. The state of the variable `minus_count` is determined by the number of '-' characters present in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `s` is a string of length n consisting of the characters '+' and '-' only; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`.**
