The function `func` does not take any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the symbols '+' and '-'. Based on the output description, the function processes the string `s` and results in a return value.

Given the constraints and relationships, the exact behavior of the function regarding its output based on the content of `s` is not provided. Therefore, it is unclear how the function evaluates the string or what specific value it returns.

Nevertheless, based on the input constraints, we can summarize the expected functionality:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), and a string s of length n consisting of the symbols '+' and '-'. The output depends on the evaluation of the string s.**
