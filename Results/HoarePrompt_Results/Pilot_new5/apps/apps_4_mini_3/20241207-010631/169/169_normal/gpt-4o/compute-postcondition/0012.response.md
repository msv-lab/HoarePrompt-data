The value of `stones` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `stones` remains either 0 or 1 based on the operation of the second character in `s`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `operation`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a non-empty input string that must have at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character in `s`, and `stones` is either 1 or 2 based on the increment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a non-empty input string that must have at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character in `s`, and `stones` is either 1 or 2 based on the increment.**
