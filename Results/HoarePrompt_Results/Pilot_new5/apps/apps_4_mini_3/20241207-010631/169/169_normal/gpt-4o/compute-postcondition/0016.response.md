According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, the loop can iterate over each character in `s`. The character `operation` is the second character in the string `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `operation` represents a character in `s`. Since the loop iterates over `s`, the next `operation` will be the third character in `s`, provided that `s` has at least 3 characters.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters, and `operation` will be the third character in `s`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `operation` is the third character in `s`.**
