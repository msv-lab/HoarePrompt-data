The value of `stones` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the previous value of `stones`, but it is assumed to be valid before the operation. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `operation`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `stones`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `operation` is the third character in `s`, `stones` is increased by 1.**
