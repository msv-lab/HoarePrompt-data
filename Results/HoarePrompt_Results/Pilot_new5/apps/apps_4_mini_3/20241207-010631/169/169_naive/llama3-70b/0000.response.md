Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails in the case where the number of "-" operations exceeds the number of "+" operations but still allows for a valid starting point. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
---
```
The expected output is `0`, which is correctly handled by the program. However, if we use the input:
```
5
----- 
```
The expected minimum number of stones should be `5` because Vasya must have started with at least `5` stones to perform all those `-` operations. Instead, the program would output `0`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not handle the case where the initial number of stones must match or exceed the number of "-" operations effectively, leading to an incorrect output in certain scenarios. Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect.
