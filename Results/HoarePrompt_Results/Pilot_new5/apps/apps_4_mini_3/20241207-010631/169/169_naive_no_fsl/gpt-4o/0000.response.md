Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after all operations, as it does not account for the necessary starting number of stones needed to ensure that taking stones never leaves the pile empty.

Consider the test case where the input is:
```
3
---
```
In this case, the program starts with `stones = 0`, and then it processes three operations of taking a stone (`-`). According to the problem description, if the pile is non-empty before each operation of taking a stone, it means Vasya must have started with at least 3 stones to perform 3 take operations. However, the program will output `0`, which is incorrect as it indicates that Vasya could have started with 0 stones and still take 3 stones, violating the problem constraints.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the conditions laid out in the problem description for all potential cases.
