Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations. 

To illustrate this, let's consider a specific case where the input is `n = 5` and `s = "++---"`. 

1. According to the operations:
   - Start with 0 stones, add 2 stones (resulting in 2).
   - Then, remove 3 stones (resulting in -1 stones).

The program currently counts the number of `+` and `-` operations and checks if the count of `-` operations is greater than `+` operations. If it is, it outputs `0`. If it isn't, it outputs the difference between the count of `+` and `-`.

However, for this case, the minimum number of stones after the operations should be `0`, since Vasya cannot have negative stones. The program would output `1` (since it subtracts the counts) instead of the correct `0`. 

Thus, the program fails to account for the logic that if the number of `-` operations exceeds the number of `+` operations, it should still return `0` because you can only have non-negative stones in the pile. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle this edge case properly.
