To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `t` must be greater than 3
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10
- `v_1` is between 1 and 100
- `v_2` is between 1 and 100
- `i` is 3
- `speeds[3]` will be assigned a value based on `min(speeds[2] + d, v_2 + (t - 4) * d)`

The code being executed is:
```
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

Analyzing the code:
- `i` is 3, so `speeds[i]` refers to `speeds[3]`.
- `speeds[i - 1] + d` refers to `speeds[2] + d`.
- The second part `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d` translates to `v_2 + (t - 3 - 1) * d`, which simplifies to `v_2 + (t - 4) * d`.

For `speeds[3]`, we will take the minimum of these two computations:
- `speeds[3] = min(speeds[2] + d, v_2 + (t - 4) * d)`

The values of `speeds[2]`, `t`, `d`, and `v_2` will determine the exact value of `speeds[3]`, but we do not have specific values for `speeds[2]`, `t`, `d`, or `v_2`, apart from the constraints given. Hence, we will represent `speeds[3]` as depending on the conditions defined.

The output state retains all the preconditions while specifying that `speeds[3]` is now defined by the minimum function.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 3, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10, `v_1` is between 1 and 100, `v_2` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 3, and `speeds[3] = min(speeds[2] + d, v_2 + (t - 4) * d)**
