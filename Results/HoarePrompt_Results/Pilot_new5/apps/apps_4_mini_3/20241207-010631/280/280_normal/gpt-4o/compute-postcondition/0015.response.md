Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer inputs v1 and v2 representing initial and final speeds, two integers t representing the total time intervals and d representing the speed increment. It calculates a list of speeds for each time interval ensuring that speeds increase by at most d without exceeding v2, and then it computes and prints the total distance covered based on these speeds. The function does not return any value, and edge cases such as when t is 2 are handled, resulting in a total distance that is simply the sum of v1 and v2. **
