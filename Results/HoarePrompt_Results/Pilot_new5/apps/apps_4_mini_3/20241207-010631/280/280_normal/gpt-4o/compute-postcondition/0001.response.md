The values of `t` and `d` are assigned from the input after being converted to integers. The output state will reflect the new values of `t` and `d`, which will now be specific integers based on user input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer.**
