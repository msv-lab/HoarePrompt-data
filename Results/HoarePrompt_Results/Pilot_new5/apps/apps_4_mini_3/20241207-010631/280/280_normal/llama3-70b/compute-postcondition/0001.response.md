The values of `t` and `d` are assigned new values based on user input. The previous constraints for `t` and `d` remain valid, with the new values being integers obtained from the input. The values of `v_1` and `v_2` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer from user input between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an integer from user input between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer from user input; `d` is an integer from user input.**
