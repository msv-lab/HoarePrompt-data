To analyze the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the initialization of the variables and how they change throughout the iterations of the loop.

Here are the key points from the initial state and the loop:

Initial State:
- `v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `t` is an integer from user input (must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute).
- `d` is an integer from user input.
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`.
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`.
- `max_length` is `max_speed * t`.
- `min_length` is `min_speed * t`.

Loop Operations:
1. The loop iterates from `t - 1` down to 1 (it executes `t - 1` times).
2. In each iteration:
   - `max_speed` decreases by `d`, but cannot go below `min_speed`.
   - `min_speed` increases by `d`, but cannot exceed `max_speed`.
   - `max_length` increases by the current value of `max_speed`.
   - `min_length` increases by the current value of `min_speed`.

Final State Analysis:
- After `t - 1` iterations, `max_speed` will be updated to the maximum between `max_speed - d * (t - 1)` and `min_speed`. If `max_speed` decreases below `min_speed` during the iterations, it will be capped at `min_speed`.
- `min_speed` will increase by `d * (t - 1)` but will be capped at `max_speed`.
- `max_length` will accumulate `max_speed` for `t - 1` iterations.
- `min_length` will accumulate `min_speed` for `t - 1` iterations.

Now, let's summarize the final output state:

- `v_1` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- `v_2` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- `t` could be any value greater than or equal to 2 (it determines the number of iterations).
- `d` remains an integer from user input.
- After `t - 1` iterations, `max_speed` could potentially be `max(max_speed - d * (t - 1), min_speed)`.
- After `t - 1` iterations, `min_speed` could potentially be `min(min_speed + d * (t - 1), max_speed)`.
- `max_length` will be `max_length + max_speed * (t - 1)`, where `max_speed` reflects its final state after the last iteration.
- `min_length` will be `min_length + min_speed * (t - 1)`, where `min_speed` reflects its final state after the last iteration.
- At the end of all iterations, `i` becomes 0 (as it starts from `t - 1` and decrements to 1).

Therefore, the final Output State is:
Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer from user input, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d * (t - 1)` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d * (t - 1)` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is 0.`**
