The variable `max_length` is updated by adding the value of `max_speed` to it. The initial values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `min_speed`, `min_length`, `i`, and `max_speed` remain unchanged. Since `max_length` is being modified, we do not have its previous value explicitly defined, but we know it is now increased by `max_speed`. The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an integer from user input, `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 1)`, `i` is `t - 2`, `max_speed` remains unchanged.**
