To evaluate the impact of the provided code snippet, let’s break down the initial state and the code execution step by step.

Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10.
- `v_1` is between 1 and 100.
- `v_2` is between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `speeds[i]` will be assigned the value `min(speeds[0] + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`.

Now, let's examine the code:
```
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

1. `i` is 2, so `speeds[i - 1]` refers to `speeds[1]`.
2. The expression `speeds[i - 1] + d` evaluates to `speeds[1] + d`.
3. The term `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d` simplifies as follows:
   - Since `i` is 2, it becomes `v_2 + (t - 2 - 1) * d`, which is `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`.

Now, we can assign the value to `speeds[2]`:
- `speeds[2] = min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`.

The values of `speeds[1]`, `v_2`, and `(t - 3) * d` might define the exact outcome, but since we don't have specific values for them in the initial condition, we can state the relation clearly without assigning exact values.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10, `v_1` is between 1 and 100, `v_2` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, and `speeds[2]` is assigned the value `min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`**.
