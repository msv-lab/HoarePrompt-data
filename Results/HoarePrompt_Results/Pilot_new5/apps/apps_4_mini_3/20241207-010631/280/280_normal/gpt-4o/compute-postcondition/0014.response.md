The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. The parameters `v_1` and `v_2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100, and `d` is an integer within the range of 0 to 10. The function does not have a specified output based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be described in terms of return values without further details on how these parameters are used or what the expected output is.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters v_1 (1 ≤ v_1 ≤ 100), v_2 (1 ≤ v_2 ≤ 100), t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), and d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), but the return value is not specified.**
