The variable `max_length` is assigned the value of `max_speed * t`. The value of `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`, both of which are integers between 1 and 100, and `t` is an integer from user input. Therefore, `max_length` will be an integer between `t` and `100 * t` depending on the values of `v_1` and `v_2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer from user input; `d` is an integer from user input; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `max_length` is `max_speed * t`.**
