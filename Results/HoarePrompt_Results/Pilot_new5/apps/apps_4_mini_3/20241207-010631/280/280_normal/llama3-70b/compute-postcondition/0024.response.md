Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer inputs `v1` and `v2` representing speeds, an integer `t` representing time, and an integer `d` representing the change in speed. It calculates the maximum and minimum distance covered over the time period `t`, where the maximum speed is reduced by `d` and the minimum speed is increased by `d` in each iteration of a loop. The function outputs the maximum distance covered and does not return any value. Edge cases include ensuring that the speeds do not go below the minimum or above the maximum during the adjustments. The function lacks error handling for invalid input types and assumes valid inputs are provided within the specified ranges.**
