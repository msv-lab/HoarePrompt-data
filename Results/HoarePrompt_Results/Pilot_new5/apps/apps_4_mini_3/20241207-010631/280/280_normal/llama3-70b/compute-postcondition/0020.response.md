The code `min_length += min_speed` updates the value of `min_length`. The previous value of `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`. The states of other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. 

Given that `min_length` was previously updated to `min_length + min_speed`, we can say that after this operation, `min_length` will now be `min_length + min_speed + min_speed`, which simplifies to `min_length + 2 * min_speed`. 

The output state remains the same for other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` must be greater than 3, `d` is an integer from user input, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + 2 * min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**.
