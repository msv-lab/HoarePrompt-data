The variable `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`. The conditions on the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` must be greater than 3, `d` is an integer from user input, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**.
