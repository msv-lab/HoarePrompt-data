The variable `max_speed` is updated to the value of `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`. This means that `max_speed` is reduced by `d`, but it cannot go below `min_speed`. The values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new value of `max_speed` will depend on the result of the calculation involving `d` and `min_speed`. 

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer from user input, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is initialized to `t - 1`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.**
