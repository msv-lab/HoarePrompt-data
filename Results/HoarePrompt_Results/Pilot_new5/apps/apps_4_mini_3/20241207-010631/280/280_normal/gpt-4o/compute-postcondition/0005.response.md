To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided state and the for loop.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, t):`. This means that `i` will take on values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `t`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 1, because if `t` is 1, the range would be `range(1, 1)`, which does not yield any values.
3. The state before the loop indicates that `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), ensuring that `t` can be at least 2, which allows the loop to start at `i = 1`.
4. The variable `i` will be initialized to 1 when the loop starts, which is valid based on the range provided.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be declared for the loop to execute correctly are:

- `t` can indeed be set to any value between 2 and 100, as per the given conditions.
- The initial value of `i` when the loop starts will be 1.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop begins are as follows:

State: **`t` is between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10, `v_1` is between 1 and 100, `v_2` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 1**.
