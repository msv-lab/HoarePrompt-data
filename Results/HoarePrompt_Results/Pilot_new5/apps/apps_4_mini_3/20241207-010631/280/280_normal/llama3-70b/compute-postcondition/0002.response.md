In the given code snippet, `max_speed` is assigned the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`. The values of both `v_1` and `v_2` are integers from user input, constrained between 1 and 100. Therefore, `max_speed` will take the greater value of the two inputs.

Since `v_1` and `v_2` can vary based on user input, `max_speed` will also vary accordingly. The other variables `t` and `d` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer from user input; `d` is an integer from user input; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`.**
