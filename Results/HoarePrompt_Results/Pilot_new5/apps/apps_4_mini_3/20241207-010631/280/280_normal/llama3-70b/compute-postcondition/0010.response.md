The code `min_length += min_speed` increments `min_length` by the current value of `min_speed`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.
- `min_length` is initially set to `min_speed * t`.

After the execution of the code, the new value of `min_length` will be `min_length + min_speed`, which is equivalent to `min_speed * t + min_speed`, simplifying to `min_speed * (t + 1)`.

The other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `max_length`, `i`, and `max_speed`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer from user input, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 1)`, `i` is initialized to `t - 1`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed`.**
