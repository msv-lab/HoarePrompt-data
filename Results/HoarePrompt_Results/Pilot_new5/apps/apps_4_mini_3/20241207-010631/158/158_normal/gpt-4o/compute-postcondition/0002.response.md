The variable `c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that is a positive integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `c` is not specified, but it will now be updated to the input value. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is now equal to the input positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is equal to the input positive integer.**
