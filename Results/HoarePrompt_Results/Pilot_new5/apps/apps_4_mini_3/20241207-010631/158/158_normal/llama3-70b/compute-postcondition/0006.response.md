Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers via standard input (a, b, and c), computes the minimum of a, b/2, and c/4, and prints the result of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which effectively calculates and displays the total quantity derived from `min_lemon` in a specific formula. The function does not return any values; it only prints the output.**
