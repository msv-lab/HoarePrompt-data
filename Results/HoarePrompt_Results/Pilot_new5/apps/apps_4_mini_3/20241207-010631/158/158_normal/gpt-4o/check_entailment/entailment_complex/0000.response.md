Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here's why it meets the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three positive integers from the user, representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). This aligns with the problem description, which specifies that each of these fruit counts must be provided as input.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of complete "fruit combinations" that can be formed based on the required ratio of fruits for the compote. Specifically, the ratio states that for each lemon, there should be 2 apples and 4 pears. The program calculates this maximum using the expression `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which effectively determines the limiting factor among the available fruits. This is correct as it ensures that the calculated number of lemons does not exceed the available count of apples and pears when considering the required ratios.

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: The formula used to compute the total fruits is `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which expands to `max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7`. This calculation correctly sums the total number of fruits used in the compote based on the maximum number of lemon combinations possible. The output reflects the total number of fruits used, which is what the problem asks for.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program also appropriately handles edge cases. For instance, if any of the input counts are insufficient to meet the ratio requirement (like not having enough pears to utilize even a single lemon), the function will correctly calculate `max_lemons` as zero, resulting in an output of `0`. This behavior is consistent with the examples provided in the problem description.

Therefore, the program adheres to the requirements and logic described, ensuring that it calculates the maximum total of fruits that can be used based on the given constraints.
