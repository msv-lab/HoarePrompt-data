Output State: **`x` is equal to a value that has been determined by following the indices through the list `p`, `visited` contains True for all indices that have been accessed, `cycle` contains all the indices that were visited in the order they were accessed. The loop terminates when `x` points to an index that has already been marked as visited.**
