The function `func` accepts two parameters: `p` and `b`. The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000. The parameter `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with the same length as `p`. 

After executing the function body, the function returns a specific output that is not detailed here. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers `p` representing a permutation of numbers and a list of integers `b` consisting of zeros and ones, processing these inputs to produce a result based on their values.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `p` representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones, both related to a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). It processes these inputs to produce a specific output.**
