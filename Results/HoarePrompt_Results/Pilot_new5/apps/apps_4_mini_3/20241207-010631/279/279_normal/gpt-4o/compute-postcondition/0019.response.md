According to the code, the loop can execute if `visited[x]` is `False`. At the end of the last iteration, `visited` has the value `True` at index `x`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `visited[x]` is `False`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers created from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of integers created from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`, `visited` must have value `False` at index `x`, `visited[0]` is `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing the values `0` and `x`, `x` is equal to `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`**
