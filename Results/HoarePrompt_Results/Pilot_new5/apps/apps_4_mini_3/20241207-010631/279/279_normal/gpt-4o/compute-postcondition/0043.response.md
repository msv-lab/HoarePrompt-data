Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list with all values set to `False`, and `cycles` is an empty list. If `visited[i]` is False, then `x` is equal to a value determined by following the indices through the list `p`, `visited` will be updated to True for all indices accessed, `cycle` will contain all the indices that were visited in order, and `cycles` will include the new `cycle`.***
