`cycle` is modified by appending the value of `x`, which is currently 2. Thus, `cycle` will now contain the element 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list where `visited[2]` is `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` now contains 2, `x` is 2**
