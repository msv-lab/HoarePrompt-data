The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. The value of `x` is already defined as `p[x] - 1`, but since `cycle` is presumably a list, its new state will include the current value of `x`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged in this context.

Output State: **`visited[x]` is now True, `cycle` includes `x` (now also includes the appended value of `x`), `x` is equal to `p[x] - 1**
