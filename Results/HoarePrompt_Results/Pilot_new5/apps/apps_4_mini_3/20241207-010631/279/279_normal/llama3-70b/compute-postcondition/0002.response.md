The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values to integers. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers, so `b` will be a list of integers, consisting of zeros and ones, and it will have the same length as the list `p`. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, and `p` is also unchanged since they are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with the same length as `p`, created from input.**
