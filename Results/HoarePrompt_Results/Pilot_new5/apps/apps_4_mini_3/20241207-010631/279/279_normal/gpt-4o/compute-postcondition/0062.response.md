Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `True`, and `cycles` contains all the cycles found in the list `p`. Each cycle in `cycles` is a list of indices representing the indices visited in each cycle detected from the input data. If `n` is 0, then `visited` is an empty list and `cycles` remains an empty list.**
