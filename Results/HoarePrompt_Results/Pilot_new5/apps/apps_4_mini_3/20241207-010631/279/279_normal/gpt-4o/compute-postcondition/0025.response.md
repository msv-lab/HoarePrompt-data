Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers created from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of integers created from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `False`, and `cycles` is an empty list. If `visited[i]` is False, `visited` is updated with `True` at indices corresponding to the elements of the detected cycle, `cycles` now contains the `cycle`, and `cycle` holds the indices visited during the loop, with `x` being the first index that caused the loop to exit.***
