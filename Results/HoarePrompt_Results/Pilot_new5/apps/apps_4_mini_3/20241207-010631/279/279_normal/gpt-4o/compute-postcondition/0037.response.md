According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `visited[x]`. The loop will execute as long as `visited[x]` is False. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `visited[x]` is True (previously False), which means the loop cannot execute again. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `visited[x]` must be adjusted back to False. There are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`visited[x]` must be False, `cycle` now includes `x`, `x` is equal to `p[x] - 1`**
