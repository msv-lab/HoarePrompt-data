The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, representing the number of cakes.
- `cakes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `(r_i, h_i)`. Each `r_i` (radius) and `h_i` (height) is constrained to the range 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000, representing the dimensions of the i-th cake.

After executing the function body, it processes the cakes based on the input values. The specific output of the function is not defined in the provided information, so we cannot specify the return value based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of each cake.**
