Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum between its current value and the sum of `cakes[0][0]` and `cakes[2][0]`. Otherwise, `dp[2]` remains unchanged.***
