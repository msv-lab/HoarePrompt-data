`dp[i]` is assigned the value `volumes[i]`. The value of `dp[i]` will now be equal to the volume of the cake at index `i` from the `volumes` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is at least 2, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes, `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`.**
