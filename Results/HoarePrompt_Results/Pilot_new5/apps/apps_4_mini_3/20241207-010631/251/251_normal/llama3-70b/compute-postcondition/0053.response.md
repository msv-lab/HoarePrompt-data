Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 3. `dp[4]` is the maximum value computed based on the conditions checked for all `j` in the range from 0 to 3, where `cakes[4][1]` must be less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[4][2]` must be less than `cakes[j][2]`. If no such `j` exists, `dp[4]` remains equal to `cakes[4][0]`.**
