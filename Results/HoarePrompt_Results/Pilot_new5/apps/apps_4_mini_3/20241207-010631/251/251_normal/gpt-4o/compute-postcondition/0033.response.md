Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is at least 2, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes, `dp[i]` is equal to `max(dp[i], dp[0] + volumes[i])` if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, and `j` is 0, ensuring the relation between `dp[i]` and the maximum achievable volume considering the current values of `volumes`.***
