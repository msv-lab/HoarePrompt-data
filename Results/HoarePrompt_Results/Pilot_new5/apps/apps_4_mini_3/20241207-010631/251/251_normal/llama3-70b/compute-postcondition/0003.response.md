The code assigns values to `r` and `h` by reading a line of input, splitting it, and converting the parts to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The values of `r` and `h` will be integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100,000), `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer**
