Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
