According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`, since the range is from 1 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 3 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` must be at least 4, and `n` must still accommodate this condition, meaning `n` must be at least 4 as well.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value based on the conditions checked for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`**
