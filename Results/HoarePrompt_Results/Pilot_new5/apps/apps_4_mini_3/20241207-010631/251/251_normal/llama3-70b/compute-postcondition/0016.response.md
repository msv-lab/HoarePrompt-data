`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `cakes[i][0]`. Since `n` must be at least `2`, `i` is `1`, and `cakes` is a list sorted in descending order by `volume`, `dp[i]` will now hold the first element of the second tuple in `cakes`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `dp[0]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`**
