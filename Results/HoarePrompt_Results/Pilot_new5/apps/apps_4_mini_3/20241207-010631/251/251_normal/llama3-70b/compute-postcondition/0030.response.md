According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i`, which determines how many iterations the loop will run. The loop iterates from `0` to `i - 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `i` is greater than `0`.

Given the current state, `n` must be at least 3, and `i` is at least 3, which ensures that there are enough iterations. Since `j` starts from `0` and goes up to `i - 1`, for the loop to execute correctly, `j` should be initialized to `0` at the beginning of the loop. 

Additionally, `dp[i]` being equal to `cakes[i][0]` does not influence the loop's execution directly; it is more about the values being calculated or modified within the loop body.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `j` should start from `0`.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is at least 3, `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, `j` is 0**
