The variable `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `volumes[i]`. The preconditions specify that `n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` ranges from 0 to `i`, and `volumes` is a list corresponding to at least `n` cakes. Since `volumes[i]` is directly assigned to `dp[i]`, this indicates that `dp[i]` now holds a specific value based on the calculated volume of the `i`-th cake. The states of the other variables remain the same, but `dp[i]` is now equal to `volumes[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` ranges from 0 to `i`, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake corresponding to `cakes`, and `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`.**
