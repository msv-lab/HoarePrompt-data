Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 2, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, and `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes. If `volumes[j]` (where `j` is 2) is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum between its previous value and `dp[2] + volumes[i]`.***
