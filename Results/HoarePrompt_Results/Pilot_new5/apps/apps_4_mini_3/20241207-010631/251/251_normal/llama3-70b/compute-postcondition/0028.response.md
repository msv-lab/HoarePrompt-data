According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 up to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, which means that for the loop to run again, `i` should be incremented to at least 3. 

Since `n` is at least 2, we must ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again after incrementing `i`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` must be incremented by 1, making it at least 3.
- `n` must be at least 3 to ensure there is an iteration for `i = 2`.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is at least 3, `dp` is updated such that `dp[i]` contains the maximum sum of cakes' values that can be obtained by selecting cakes that have both dimensions less than those of previously considered cakes, and `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`.**
