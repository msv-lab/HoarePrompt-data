The code `data = input().split()` takes input from the user, splits the input string into a list of substrings (based on spaces), and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer and `cakes` is a list of tuples, but the specific contents of `cakes` or `data` are not known before the input is taken. Therefore, the state of `n` and `cakes` remains unchanged, while `data` becomes a list of strings representing the input values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r_i, h_i), and `data` is a list of strings obtained from input.**
