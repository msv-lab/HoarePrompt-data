The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, and `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r, h) representing the radius and height of each cake, with constraints that 1 ≤ r, h ≤ 10,000. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum sum of volumes of cakes that can be stacked, as represented by the maximum value in the list 'dp'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, and return the maximum sum of volumes of the cakes that can be stacked. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of tuples cakes, returns the maximum sum of volumes of cakes that can be stacked.**
