The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of a cake. It computes the volume of each cake and returns the maximum sum of volumes of cakes that can be stacked, ensuring that a cake can only be placed on top of another if its volume is greater than the one below it.
