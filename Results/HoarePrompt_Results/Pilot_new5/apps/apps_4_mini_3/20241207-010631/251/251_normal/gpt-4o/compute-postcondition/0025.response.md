The expression `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])` updates the value of `dp[i]`. The previous value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged unless the new value calculated by `max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])` is greater. The value of `dp[j]` is also used in the computation, but the exact values are unknown.

- `dp[i]` is updated based on its previous value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `cakes`, and `volumes` remain unchanged, but `dp[i]` may have a new value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.**
