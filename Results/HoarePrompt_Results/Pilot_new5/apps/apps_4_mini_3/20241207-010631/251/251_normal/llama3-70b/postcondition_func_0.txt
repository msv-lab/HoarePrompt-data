The function processes a collection of cakes defined by their radius and height, computes the volume for each cake, and determines the maximum sum of volumes that can be obtained by stacking cakes such that each cake in the stack must have both a smaller radius and height than the cake below it. The function does not accept any parameters and outputs the maximum sum of the cake volumes based on the stacking conditions.
