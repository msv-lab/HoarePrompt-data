Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
