Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake corresponding to `cakes`, and `dp[i]` is the maximum value that can be obtained by summing the volumes of cakes whose dimensions are less than that of the `i`-th cake. If the loop does not execute (when `i` is 0), then `dp[0]` remains equal to `volumes[0]` and all other `dp` values remain initialized to zero.**
