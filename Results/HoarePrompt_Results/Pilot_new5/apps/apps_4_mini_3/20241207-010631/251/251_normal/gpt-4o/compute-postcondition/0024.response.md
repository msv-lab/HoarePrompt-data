According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes.**
