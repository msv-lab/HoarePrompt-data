The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the value from `cakes[i][0]`. Since `i` is 4, the value of `dp[4]` is now equal to `cakes[4][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, and `dp[4]` is equal to `cakes[4][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp[4]` is equal to `cakes[4][0]**
