Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes, and `dp[i]` is equal to the maximum achievable volume considering all previous `dp[j]` values where `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`.**
