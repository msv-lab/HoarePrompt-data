The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 element; `num` is the first element in `arr`, `num` is not equal to `mex`, and the current value of `num` is greater than `mex`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
