The loop iterates through the sorted list `a`, checking if each element `num` is greater than or equal to the current value of `mex`. If it is, `mex` is incremented by 1. The loop will continue until it has checked all elements of `a`. 

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `mex` will reflect the smallest positive integer that could not be formed from the elements of the list `a`. The relationship between `mex` and the elements of the list can be summarized as follows:

- If all integers from 1 up to `k` are present in the list `a`, then `mex` will equal `k + 1` after the loop.
- If there are any integers missing between 1 and `k`, then `mex` will stop incrementing at the first missing integer.

Thus, the number of increments to `mex` depends on the contents of the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.**
