The variable `mex` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer that has now been set to the input value, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `mex` is now equal to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that has now been set to the input value, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `mex` is 1**.
