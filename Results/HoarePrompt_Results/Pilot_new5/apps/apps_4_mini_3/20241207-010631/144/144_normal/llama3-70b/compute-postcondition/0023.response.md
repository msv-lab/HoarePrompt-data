The code provided prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`. The variable `mex` is not modified by the code; only its value is displayed. The initial state remains intact. Therefore, the output state only reflects that `mex` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers; `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`.**
