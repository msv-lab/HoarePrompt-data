According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, the loop will iterate over its elements. The important variables here are `num`, which is the current element in the iteration, and `mex`, which may be modified based on the condition involving `num`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `num` is the last element processed in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, we must consider the next element in `arr`. Since it is sorted, if there are more elements in `arr`, the next `num` will be the succeeding element. 

Given the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000) and `arr` has at least 1 element, we do not know how many elements are left in the list but we can say:

1. If the current `num` is the last element in `arr`, there will be no more iterations.
2. If there are more elements, the next `num` will be the next integer in `arr`.

Thus, if `num` is the last element, we cannot execute the loop again. If `num` is not the last element, we need to prepare for the next iteration, which means `num` will become the next element in `arr`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers; `num` is the next element in `arr` (the next integer in the sorted order), `mex` remains unchanged unless `num` equals `mex` in the next iteration.**
