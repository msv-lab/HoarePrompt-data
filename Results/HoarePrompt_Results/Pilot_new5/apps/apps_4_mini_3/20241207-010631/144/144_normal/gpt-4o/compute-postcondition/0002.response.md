The operation `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `n` is a positive integer that has been set to the input value and `a` consists of `n` positive integers, the sorting will rearrange the elements of `a` without changing the value of `n` itself.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that has now been set to the input value, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9**
