Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers; `num` is the next element in `arr`. If `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` is incremented by 1. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the loop or if statement is exited, and `mex` remains unchanged unless `num` equals `mex` in the next iteration.***
