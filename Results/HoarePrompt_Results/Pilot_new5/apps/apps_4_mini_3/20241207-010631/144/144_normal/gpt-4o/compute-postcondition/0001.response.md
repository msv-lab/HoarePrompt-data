The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the results of `input().split()`, effectively transforming input strings into integers. The list `a` will now contain `n` integers, which are the positive integers entered by the user, with the constraint that each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The value of `n` remains the same, as it was previously set to the input value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that has now been set to the input value, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9**
