The variable `arr` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over input values split from a string. The input function accepts a space-separated string of integers, which will be converted to integers and stored in `arr`. The value of `n` does not change, but it determines how many integers will be inputted into `arr`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a list of `n` input integers.**
