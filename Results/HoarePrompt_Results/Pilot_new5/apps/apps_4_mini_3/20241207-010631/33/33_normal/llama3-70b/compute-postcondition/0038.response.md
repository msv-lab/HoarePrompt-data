The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program. This means that the program will not proceed further, and no variables will be updated or changed. The output state will reflect that the program has exited without modifying any of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` is a string; `curr_lat` is not updated; the program has exited.**
