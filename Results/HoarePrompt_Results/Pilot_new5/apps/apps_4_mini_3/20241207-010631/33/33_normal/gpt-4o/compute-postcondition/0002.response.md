The variable `valid` is assigned the value `True`. The initial states of `n` and `position` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `position` is 0; `valid` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `position` is 0; `valid` is True**.
