According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute `n` times as long as `n` is at least 1, which is given in the state description (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50). The variable `curr_lat` does not directly affect the loop execution, but it does reflect a state that may be relevant within the loop body. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop will have executed a number of times equal to `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The underscore `_` indicates that the loop variable is not used, so we do not need to consider it.

To summarize, before the loop starts:
- `n` is already given to be a valid integer as per the constraints.
- The loop will execute `n` times.
- The final state after the last iteration will not specifically affect the loop executing initially.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90**
