Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `dir` is 'North', `position` is updated to `position - t`, and `valid` is set to False if `position - t` is less than 0. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position + t`, `valid` is set to False if `position + t` is greater than 20000. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East' and `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False with no change in state for the other variables. If `dir` is neither 'South', 'West', nor 'East', there is also no change in state for the variables.***
