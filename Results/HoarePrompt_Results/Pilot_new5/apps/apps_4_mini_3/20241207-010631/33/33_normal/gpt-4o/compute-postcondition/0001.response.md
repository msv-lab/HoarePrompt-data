The variable `position` is initialized to 0, and it does not depend on `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the execution of the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `position` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `position` is 0**
