The code snippet provided executes a `print` statement that outputs the string 'NO'. This action does not alter the values of any variables, but it indicates that the program has reached a point where an exit condition has been met. Based on the initial state, we infer that `curr_lat` was outside the valid range of -90 to 90, causing the program to print 'NO' and indicating that the program has exited without making any updates to `curr_lat`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that the program has printed 'NO', and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` is a string; `curr_lat` is not updated; 'NO' was printed, indicating that the program has exited.**
