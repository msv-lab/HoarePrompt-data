The variable `curr_lat` is updated by subtracting `t / 111.195` from its previous value. The values of `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged and are still valid after the execution. The impact of the code suggests that `curr_lat` will now reflect a new latitude value based on the division of `t` by `111.195`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 49; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string from input; `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)`**.
