The code `exit()` is executed, which causes the program to terminate immediately. No variables are updated, and the program has exited without making any changes to the state. Therefore, the output reflects that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` is a string; if `curr_lat` equals -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then `curr_lat` is not updated and the program has exited; the output is 'NO'.**
