To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's analyze the impact step by step:

1. The variable `position` is modified by subtracting `t` from it.
2. The initial conditions state that `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20,000, and `t` is a positive integer since it is an input converted to an actual integer.
3. The code `position -= t` will change the value of `position` to `position - t`.

Now, if `position - t` results in a value less than 0, according to the conditions set in the initial state, the state remains unchanged. However, if `position - t` is greater than or equal to 0, `position` will be decreased by `t`.

Since we need to articulate the output state accurately, we cannot provide an exact number for the new `position` without knowing the initial values of `position` and `t`. However, we can establish the relationship based on the conditions given.

Thus, we can summarize:

- If `position - t` < 0, then `position` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `position` is updated to `position - t`.

Now, we articulate the output state considering the scenarios:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is set to False, `t` is an input integer, and if `position - t` < 0 then `position` is unchanged; otherwise, `position` is `position - t`.**
