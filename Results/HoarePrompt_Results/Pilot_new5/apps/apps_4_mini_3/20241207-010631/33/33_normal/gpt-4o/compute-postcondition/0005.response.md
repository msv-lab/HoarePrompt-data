The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, converting the input value `t` to an integer. Other variables remain unaffected, so the output state includes the original conditions for those variables, along with the updated value of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `position` is 0, `valid` is True, `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input value**
