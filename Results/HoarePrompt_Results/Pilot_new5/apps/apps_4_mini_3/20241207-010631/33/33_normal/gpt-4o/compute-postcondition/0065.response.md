The `print('YES')` statement is executed, which outputs the string 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `position`, and `valid` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of these variables, with the addition of the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `position` is within the range [0, 20000]; `valid` is True, indicating that all movements were valid; output printed is 'YES'**.
