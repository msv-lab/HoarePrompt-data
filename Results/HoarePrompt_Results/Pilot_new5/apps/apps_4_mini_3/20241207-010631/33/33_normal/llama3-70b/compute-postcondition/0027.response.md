The variables `t` and `dir` are assigned values based on the `input()` function, which splits the input string into two parts. The initial state indicates that `dir` is not 'South', but it does not provide specific values for `t` or `dir` after the input. The ranges and conditions for `n`, `curr_lat`, and the state of `dir` do not change. Therefore, the output state must reflect that `t` and `dir` are now determined by the input given.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input value, `dir` is an input value and dir is not 'South'**
