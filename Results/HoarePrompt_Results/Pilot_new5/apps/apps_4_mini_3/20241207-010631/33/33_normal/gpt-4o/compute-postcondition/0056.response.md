Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position + t`, `valid` is set to False, and `t` is an integer such that `position + t` is greater than 20000. Otherwise, if `dir` is 'West' or 'East' and `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, and there is no change in state for the variables. If `dir` is neither 'South', 'West', nor 'East', there is also no change in state for the variables.***
