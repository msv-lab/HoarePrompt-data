According to the code, the loop will execute a total of `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50. After the last iteration, we have executed the loop `n` times, so we need to consider what happens at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop uses `_` as the loop variable, it does not affect any external state.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute again, it must not exceed the defined range of 1 to 50. Since we have completed the loop for `n` iterations, there won't be a next iteration; hence we do not need to change `position` or `valid` because they are only checked during the loop execution.

Therefore, the states regarding `position` and `valid` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `position` is within the valid range, `valid` is True**
