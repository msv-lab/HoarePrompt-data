The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this context, assuming that the code is inside a loop, it indicates that no changes will be made to the variables `n`, `t`, or `dir`. The values of these variables remain unchanged, and we only note that the current iteration has been skipped.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 49; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string from input, updated based on the split input, and the current iteration of the loop has been skipped.**
