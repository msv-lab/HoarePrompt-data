The `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its previous value. The initial states of `n`, `t`, and `dir` are not directly affected by this operation, but we note that `t` is an integer. The exact value of `curr_lat` will depend on its previous value and the value of `t`. Since `curr_lat` is not specified in the initial state, we can only express the change in terms of the formula used.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 49; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string from input; `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`.**
