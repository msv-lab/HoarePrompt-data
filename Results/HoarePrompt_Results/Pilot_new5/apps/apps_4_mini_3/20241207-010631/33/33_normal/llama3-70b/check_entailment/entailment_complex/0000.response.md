Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Handling Directions**: The problem description states that Limak can only move "North" or "South" when starting from or reaching the poles, and cannot move "West" or "East" at the poles. The program handles "West" and "East" by simply ignoring those commands, which is inappropriate. If Limak receives a "West" or "East" command while at either pole, it should return "NO" immediately.

2. **Latitude Calculation**: The program calculates latitude based on a conversion using `111.195`, which is intended to convert kilometers to degrees. However, thereâ€™s an implicit assumption that the distance traveled does not exceed the limits of the sphere's surface. This is not explicitly checked. If the distance traveled were to exceed the distance to the pole (20,000 km), it could lead to an incorrect state.

3. **Pole Validation**: When at the North Pole (90 degrees), Limak can only move "South". If the program proceeds to process an "East" or "West" movement at that point (by ignoring it), it does not correctly handle the requirement that such movements should not occur at the pole.

4. **Ending Condition**: The program checks if `curr_lat` ends at 90 but does not validate if Limak returned to the North Pole after all movements, especially given it ignores certain directions leading to potential invalid states.

Given these issues, the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
