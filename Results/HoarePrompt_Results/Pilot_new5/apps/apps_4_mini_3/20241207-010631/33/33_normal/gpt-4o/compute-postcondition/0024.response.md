Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `dir` is 'North', then `position` is set to `-t`, `valid` is set to False, and `t` is an integer if `-t < 0`. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is updated to `position + t`, `valid` is set to False, and if `position + t` exceeds 20000, `valid` remains False. If `dir` is not 'South', then `position` is either 0 or 20000, and `valid` is set to False if `dir` is 'West' or 'East'; if `dir` is neither 'West' nor 'East', the values of `n`, `position`, `valid`, `t`, and `dir` retain their initial state.***
