Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where Limak is moving in the "West" or "East" directions correctly. According to the problem description, Limak should only be able to move "South" when at the North Pole or "North" when at the South Pole. However, if the journey includes a movement to the "West" or "East" while at any position other than the poles, it is permissible, but the program has a `continue` statement that skips any checks for invalid movements in these directions, potentially leading to an invalid state.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
20000 South
1000 East
20000 North
```

In this case, Limak starts at the North Pole, moves 20000 km South to the equator, moves 1000 km East, and finally moves 20000 km North. The program would incorrectly print "YES" because it does not check if a valid movement was made. However, the movement from "South" to "East" (without proper constraints) raises the validity issue.

Therefore, since the program does not correctly validate the journey based on the conditions specified in the problem description, the correctness is false.
