The provided program aims to calculate the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`. 

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `x` and `y` from input, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. This adheres to the constraints given in the problem description.

2. **Calculation**: The program computes the number of operations as follows:
   - It calculates the difference between `x` and `y` as `x - y`, which represents how much we need to decrease the side length.
   - The expression `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of complete 2-length decrements that can be made.
   - The expression `(x - y) % 2` accounts for any remaining length (either 0 or 1) that needs an additional operation.

3. **Logic Behind the Calculation**: The intended operation is to keep the triangle non-degenerate. As the modifications are done in a systematic manner, starting from `x`, we adjust downwards toward `y`. Each operation changes one side of the triangle, yet we must ensure that the sides can still form a valid triangle. The formula effectively calculates the number of operations needed to reduce the side length from `x` to `y`.

4. **Correctness**: The approach presented in the program handles all potential cases to ensure that the triangle remains non-degenerate:
   - For every decrease of 1 in a side length, at least one other side must remain equal to or larger to satisfy the triangle inequality. The formula ensures that this invariant is maintained throughout the operations. 
   - For example, if starting with `(x, x, x)`, the approach leads to `(x, x, y)`, and subsequently modifies the sides while adhering to the required constraints outlined in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, we can conclude that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the triangle from side length `x` to `y` while maintaining triangle validity.

Thus, the final conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
