The code calculates the sum of all positive integers in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `B`. The value of `n` remains the same since it represents the number of integers in the list. The list `a` itself also remains unchanged, but based on its values, `B` is determined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`.**
