The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the prior condition states that `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), the new state of `n` will depend on the input it receives, which must remain within that range. The list `a` remains unchanged because no operations are performed on it. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
