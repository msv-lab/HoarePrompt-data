The value of `b` will be updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. According to the initial state, `i` is either 0 or an odd integer incremented by 1, which means it is always even after the increment. Therefore, `b` will be set to `a[i]` since `i` is even. As `b` was previously set to `a[i]` when `i` was even, we update `b` to include this new sum.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order; `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`; `c` may be updated; `i` is an even integer.**
