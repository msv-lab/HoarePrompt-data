The variables `b` and `c` are both assigned the value of `0`. The initial state of the variables `n` and `a` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State remains consistent with the initial conditions and updates the values of `b` and `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `b` is 0; `c` is 0**
