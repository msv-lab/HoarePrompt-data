The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Both `n` and `m` are even integers within the range [2, 10^9], and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m. However, the specific output or return value of the function is not provided in the given information. Therefore, I cannot describe what the function returns based on the provided details.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m (even integers in the range [2, 10^9]), and k (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m). The return value is not specified.**
