The initial state provides us with the following information:

- `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq k < n \times m - (n - 1) \).
- `full_rows` is equal to \( k // (m - 1) \).
- `remaining_steps` is equal to \( k \% (m - 1) \).
- The current value of `full_rows` is even.
- `row` is equal to \( n - full_rows \).

The line of code `col = 2 + remaining_steps` assigns a new value to `col`. The value of `remaining_steps` is derived from the expression \( k \% (m - 1) \). Given that `remaining_steps` is an integer resulting from the modulo operation, `col` will be calculated accordingly.

The other variables remain unchanged, but we now have a specific new value for `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m - (n - 1), `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`, the current value of `full_rows` is even, `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`.**
