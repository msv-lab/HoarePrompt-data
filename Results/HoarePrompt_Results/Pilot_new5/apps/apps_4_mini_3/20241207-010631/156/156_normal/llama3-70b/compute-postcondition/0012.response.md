Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: two even integers `n` and `m` (both in the range [2, 10^9]) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 <= k < n * m). It processes `k` to determine and print specific coordinates based on its value relative to `n`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints (k + 1, 1). If `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 2`, it computes and prints the coordinates based on a calculation involving `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, it defaults to printing the coordinates (1, 2). The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.**
