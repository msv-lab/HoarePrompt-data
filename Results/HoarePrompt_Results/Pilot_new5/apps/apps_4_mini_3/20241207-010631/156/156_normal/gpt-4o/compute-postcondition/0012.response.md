Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m - (n - 1), `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`, and `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. Otherwise, if `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is an odd integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps.`***
