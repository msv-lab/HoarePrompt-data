The value of `row` is assigned the result of `n - full_rows`. Given that `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, and `full_rows` is an odd integer, the result of `row` will be an odd integer (since subtracting an odd integer from an even integer results in an odd integer). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m - (n - 1), `full_rows` is an odd integer, and `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, which is an odd integer.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m - (n - 1), `full_rows` is an odd integer, and `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, which is an odd integer.**
