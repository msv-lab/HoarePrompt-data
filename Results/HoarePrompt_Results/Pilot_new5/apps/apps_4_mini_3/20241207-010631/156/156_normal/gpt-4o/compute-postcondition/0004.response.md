The variable `full_rows` is assigned the value of `k // (m - 1)`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer and `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `m - 1` is a positive integer. The value of `full_rows` will thus depend on the values of `k` and `m`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m - (n - 1), and `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m - (n - 1), `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`**.
