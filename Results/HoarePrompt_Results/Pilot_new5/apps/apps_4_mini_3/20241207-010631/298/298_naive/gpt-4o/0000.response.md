To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Summary
Vasya needs three integer points within defined boundaries such that the area of the triangle formed by these points equals \( \frac{nm}{k} \). 

### Key Points from the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
2. **Area Calculation**: It calculates the area as \( area = \frac{n \cdot m}{k} \).
3. **Check for Valid Area**:
   - If the area is not an integer, it prints "NO".
   - If the area is zero, it prints "NO".
4. **Finding Points**:
   - It attempts to determine points to form a triangle of the required area based on specific conditions:
     - If \( 2 \cdot area \leq n \): it prints points based on that condition.
     - If \( 2 \cdot area \leq m \): it prints different points.
     - Otherwise, it tries to utilize the maximum boundaries \( n \) and \( m \).

### Potential Cases Where It Might Fail
1. **Area Calculation**: If \( nm \) is not divisible by \( k \), it correctly identifies that a triangle cannot be formed and outputs "NO".
2. **Non-integer Area**: The check for integer area is valid.
3. **Edge Cases**: It does not handle scenarios where the calculated \( area > \frac{nm}{2} \). For example, if \( n = 1 \), \( m = 1 \), and \( k = 2 \), the area would be \( \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5 \), which is not an integer and should return "NO", which it does correctly. 

### Finding a Failure Point
However, consider the case where:
- \( n = 2 \)
- \( m = 2 \)
- \( k = 3 \)

Here, the area would be \( \frac{2 \cdot 2}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \), which is not an integer, so it should output "NO".

Now, let's consider:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( m = 3 \)
- \( k = 4 \)

Here, the area would be \( \frac{3 \cdot 3}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \), also not an integer, and should return "NO", which it does.

However, if we take:
- \( n = 4 \)
- \( m = 4 \)
- \( k = 5 \)

The area would be \( \frac{4 \cdot 4}{5} = \frac{16}{5} \), which is not an integer, and thus it should return "NO". This works correctly since the program checks for integer area.

### Conclusion
After evaluating the code against various input scenarios, I found that it does correctly produce the outputs specified in the problem description. 

Since I cannot find a case where it fails to provide the correct output based on the problem statement, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**.
