To assess the correctness of the provided code for the problem description, let's break down the functionality based on the problem requirements and the code provided.

### Problem Analysis
The problem states that we need to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
- \(0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n\)
- \(0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m\)
- The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Code Analysis
The code provided consists of three functions:
1. **func_1**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
2. **func_2**: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integer coefficients such that \(a*x + b*y = gcd(a, b)\).
3. **func_3**: Uses func_2 to return a tuple of integers \(x\) and \(y\) as well as the result of \(x*a + y*b\).

The main logic checks whether \(n * m \% k\) is zero to determine if a triangle with the desired area can exist. If it can, it calculates new coordinates based on the output of func_3.

### Edge Cases
1. **Area Calculation**: The code checks if \(n * m \% k\) is zero. If it is not, it prints "NO", which is correct as it would be impossible to form such a triangle if the area is not a whole number.
   
   However, we need to check whether \(g = x * a + y * b\) leads to valid coordinates. Specifically, it checks if \(abs(n1 * m) >= g\) for the second point. If \(abs(n1 * m) < g\), it returns "NO". This can be problematic if the calculations of \(n1\) or \(m1\) lead to valid non-negative coordinates that were not checked, potentially producing false negatives.

2. **Coordinate Limits**: The code does not explicitly check if the resulting calculated coordinates from \(x_n\) and \(y_m\) stay within the bounds of \(0\) to \(n\) for \(x\) and \(0\) to \(m\) for \(y\). This is essential, as points outside these bounds are invalid.

### Output Hints Analysis
- The output hints describe that the calculations return valid points based on GCD calculations; however, they donâ€™t directly address whether the resulting points are valid with respect to the bounds given in the problem description.

### Conclusion
After evaluating the code and understanding the problem requirements:

1. The program could potentially produce valid coordinates that fall outside the specified bounds of \(0\) to \(n\) and \(0\) to \(m\).
2. The checks in the code do not guarantee that all possible cases are handled, particularly if the derived coordinates exceed specified limits.

Given this analysis, the program does not meet the problem's requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
