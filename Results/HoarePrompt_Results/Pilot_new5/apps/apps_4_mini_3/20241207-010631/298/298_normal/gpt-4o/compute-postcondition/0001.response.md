The variable `area` is assigned the value of `n * m / k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from user input, so they can hold any integer values. The calculation assigns a new value to `area`, which will be equal to the product of `n` and `m` divided by `k`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from user input; `area` is equal to `n * m / k`.**
