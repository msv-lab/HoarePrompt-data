To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to analyze if it correctly implements the requirements for finding three integer points that form a triangle with a specified area.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program needs to check if the area of the triangle formed by the points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
2. The points should be integer coordinates satisfying the bounded conditions: \(0 \leq x_i \leq n\) and \(0 \leq y_i \leq m\) for \(i = 1, 2, 3\).
3. If no such points exist, it should print "NO". If they do exist, it should print "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program first checks if \(n \cdot m \mod k \) is non-zero. If this condition is true, it prints "NO", which implies that the triangle's area cannot be an integer due to the division.
   
2. It then calls `func_3(n, m)`, which uses `func_2(a, b)` to compute \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b\) is an integer. The `func_2` function is essentially performing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, providing coefficients for \(n\) and \(m\).

3. The main logic checks if the condition \(abs(n1 \cdot m) >= g\) holds true, where \(g\) is the computed area of the triangle. However, this is not directly checking the area against \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The derived points `(0, 0)`, `(0, n1 * m // g)`, and `(m1 * m // g, 0)` are generated based on these calculations.

### Points of Failure:
- The check \(abs(n1 \cdot m) >= g\) does not necessarily ensure that the area of the triangle formed by the generated points matches \(\frac{nm}{k}\). It appears to be misaligned with the required area calculation.
- The points generated may not always satisfy the triangle area formula due to potential miscalculations of \(g\).

### Example Case Analysis:
For an input \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), and \(k = 7\):
- The area required would be \(\frac{16}{7}\), which is not an integer. The program should return "NO", which is correct in this case.
- On the other hand, for an input \(n = 4\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 3\), the area required is 4. The program must generate three distinct integer points that meet the area requirement, but due to the flawed check, it might return incorrect points or miss valid combinations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not consistently ensure that the output points form a triangle with the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The logic around generating the triangle points and checking the area is insufficient and flawed.

Correctness: **False**
