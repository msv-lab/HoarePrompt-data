To determine whether the given Python program meets the requirements of the problem description, let's analyze its functionality against the specified requirements:

### Problem Requirements
1. **Input**: The program takes three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. **Condition**: It needs to check if itâ€™s possible to find three integer points such that:
   - The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).
3. **Output**:
   - If it is possible to find such points, print "YES" followed by the coordinates of the three points.
   - If not possible, print "NO".

### Program Analysis
1. **Area Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates the area as \( area = \frac{n \times m}{k} \).
   - It checks if this area is an integer (`if (area != int(area))`). If not, it prints "NO", which aligns with the requirement since a non-integer area cannot represent the triangle formed by integer points.

2. **Zero Area Check**:
   - It checks if the area is zero (`if (area == 0)`). This is correct because if the area is zero, it means that it is impossible to form a triangle.

3. **Triangle Point Calculation**:
   - The program then attempts to find three points based on the calculated area:
     - If \( 2 \times area \le n \), it outputs points such that one vertex is at \( (0,0) \) and the others are calculated based on the area.
     - If \( 2 \times area \le m \), it follows a similar logic but with the roles of x and y reversed.
     - If both conditions are false, it tries another method of establishing points.

4. **Output**: 
   - The program outputs "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points if it can find valid points that satisfy the area condition. 

### Potential Issues
- The program does not strictly validate if the generated points indeed form a triangle of the required area.

### Conclusion
While the program has a valid structure for calculating the area and determining potential points, it lacks a conclusive validation step to ensure the points indeed satisfy the area requirements. The output might not always yield valid triangles for all inputs due to this lack of verification.

Thus, the correctness statement for this program is as follows:

Correctness: **False** 

This is because there are scenarios where the points generated do not satisfy the area requirement of \( \frac{nm}{k} \) despite the program printing "YES". A correct implementation would need to verify that the area calculation using the provided points yields the exact desired area.
