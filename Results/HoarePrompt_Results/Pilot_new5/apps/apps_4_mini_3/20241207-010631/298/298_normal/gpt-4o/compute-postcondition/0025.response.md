The function `func` does not have any input parameters. Based on its output, it performs computations or checks based on internal logic and returns a result. Since there are no defined parameters, the functionality is inferred to be dependent on the constraints provided (n, m, and k), even though they are not explicitly accepted as arguments in the function definition.

As the output specifics of the return value are not provided, we cannot analyze the output cases specifically. However, we can assert that the function operates under the constraints defined for n, m, and k.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but operates under the constraints where n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9, and returns a result based on internal logic.**
