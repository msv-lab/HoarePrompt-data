The function accepts two parameters, `a` (an integer) and `b` (a non-negative integer). It implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which returns a tuple. If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0). Otherwise, it recursively computes the values based on the inputs, ultimately returning (y, x - a // b * y), where `x` and `y` are derived from the recursive call with parameters (b, a % b). This means the function calculates coefficients x and y such that `a*x + b*y = gcd(a, b)`.
