`pairs` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) * max_9s`. Given that `n` is initially 0, `(n + 1)` evaluates to 1. Therefore, `pairs` becomes `1 * max_9s`, which is equal to `max_9s`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is the count of trailing 9s in the initial value of `n`, `pairs` is equal to `max_9s`.**
