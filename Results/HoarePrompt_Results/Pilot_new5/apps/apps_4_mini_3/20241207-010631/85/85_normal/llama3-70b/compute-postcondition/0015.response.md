Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and counts the number of pairs `(i, n-i)` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n/2` such that the sum `i + (n - i)` is divisible by the highest power of 10 that is less than or equal to that sum. It then prints the count of such pairs. The function does not return any value; it simply outputs the result. **
