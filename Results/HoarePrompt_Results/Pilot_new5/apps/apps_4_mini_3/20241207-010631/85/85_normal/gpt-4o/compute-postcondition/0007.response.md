The operation `n //= 10` performs an integer division of `n` by 10 and assigns the result back to `n`. Given that the initial value of `n` is 8, performing the integer division will result in `n` becoming 0 because 8 divided by 10 is 0 when using integer division.

The values of `max_9s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is 2**
