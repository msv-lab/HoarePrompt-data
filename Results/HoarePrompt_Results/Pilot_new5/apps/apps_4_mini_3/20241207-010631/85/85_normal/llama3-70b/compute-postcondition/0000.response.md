`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous constraint on `n` remains valid, meaning `n` will still be defined as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, but now it will hold whatever integer value is provided as input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an input integer.**
