To determine the conditions under which the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the loop's condition:

```
while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
```

The loop will execute if `(n + 1) % 10` equals zero, which means that `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10. This implies that `n + 1` needs to be in the form of `10k` for some integer `k`, which can be rewritten as:

```
n = 10k - 1
```

Given the constraints on `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), we can infer the following:

- We need `n + 1` to be at least 10 for the loop to execute at least once, which implies `n` must be at least 9 (since `n + 1` must equal at least 10).
- More specifically, for `n + 1` to be exactly a multiple of 10, `n` should be of the form `9, 19, 29, ...` (and so forth).

The current state right before the loop is given as `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, and `max_9s` is 0. 

In order for the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 9. 

Thus, the conditions that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one time are:

State: **`n must be at least 9`, `max_9s` is 0**
