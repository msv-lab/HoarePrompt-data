To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func`.

The function is designed to take an integer `n` (the number of shovels) as input and compute the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

1. The first part of the function:
   ```python
   while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
       max_9s += 1
       n //= 10
   ```
   This loop checks how many trailing nines can be formed by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 as long as `n + 1` is divisible by 10. However, this logic will fail for certain values of `n`. For example:
   - If `n = 9`, `n + 1` is 10, and the loop will execute once resulting in `n` becoming 0 which is incorrect since there are no shovels. 
   - If `n = 10`, the loop doesn't execute and `max_9s` remains 0, which is also incorrect; there should be pairs that sum to 9.

2. The second part of the function calculates the number of pairs:
   ```python
   pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
   ```
   This assumes that the number of pairs can be calculated as `(n + 1) * max_9s`, which is misleading. The correct way to count pairs should involve finding specific pairs of indices `(i, j)` that can yield the maximum trailing nines, rather than multiplying.

Now let's think of specific examples:
- For `n = 10`, the maximum number of trailing nines is 0, and the number of pairs should also be 0, but the code would output `1 * 0 = 0`, which is correct.
- For `n = 11`, the maximum number of trailing nines is 0, but it will output `1 * 0 = 0` which is correct.
- For `n = 12`, maximum trailing nines is 0, there are no pairs with costs that will yield a sum ending in 9.

However, the logic is flawed because it doesn't capture all valid pairs for different scenarios accurately. For instance:
- For `n = 14`, the function gives maximum trailing nines of `1`, but the pairs considered should yield a more comprehensive count that isn't simply derived by the current logic. It fails to account for various configurations effectively.

In summary, it seems that the logic in the loop and the way pairs are calculated doesn't align with the outlined requirements from the problem description, particularly in terms of pair counting and edge cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly for various cases, particularly for `n` values where trailing calculations are misrepresented and do not yield the right count of shovel pairs.
