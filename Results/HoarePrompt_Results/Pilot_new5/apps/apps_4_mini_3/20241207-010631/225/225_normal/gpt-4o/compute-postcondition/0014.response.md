The variable `prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The other variables, `s` and `max_jump`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `prev_pos` while maintaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 2, `i` is 2, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of `max_jump` and `2 - prev_pos`, `prev_pos` is 2.**
