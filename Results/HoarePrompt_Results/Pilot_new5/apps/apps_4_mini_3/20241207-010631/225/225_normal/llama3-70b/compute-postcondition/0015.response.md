The variable `max_jump` is being assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i + 1`. The previous values are `i` is 1. Therefore, `i + 1` will be 2. The value of `max_jump` will depend on its previous value, which is not provided, but it will be at least 2 if `max_jump` was less than 2. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 0, and `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 2)**.
