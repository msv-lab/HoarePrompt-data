The function `func` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, based on the provided constraints, the function operates on a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100. 

Given that there is no specific output detail provided in your request, I will describe the expected behavior based on typical functions that may process such strings. For a proper description of functionality, further details about the output would be required.

Assuming the function processes the string in some way (e.g., counting letters, transforming the string, etc.), the functionality could be framed as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a non-empty string of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100. The specific return value is dependent on the internal logic of the function, which is not provided.** 

If you have more specific details regarding the output or the internal logic of the function, please provide that information for a more precise description.
