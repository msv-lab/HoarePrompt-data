According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `len(s)` is at least 1, which means the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the first iteration, `i` will be 0. The other variables `vowels`, `max_jump`, and `prev_pos` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute in this case. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0**
