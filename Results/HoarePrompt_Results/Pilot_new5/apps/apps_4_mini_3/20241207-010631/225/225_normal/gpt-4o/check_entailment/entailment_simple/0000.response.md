Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets those requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a non-empty string of capital English letters from the input, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Identifying Vowels**: It defines a set of vowels ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y') and checks each character in the string to see if it is a vowel. This is consistent with the definition of vowels provided in the problem.

3. **Calculating Maximum Jump Distance**:
   - The program initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1. The variable `prev_pos` will keep track of the index of the last vowel encountered.
   - As it iterates through the string, every time it finds a vowel, it calculates the distance from the previous vowel (or the start of the string for the first vowel). This distance represents the potential jump needed to reach the new vowel.
   - It updates `max_jump` with the maximum of its current value and the new distance if a vowel is found.

4. **Final Calculation**: After the loop, the program checks the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string (which is equal to the length of the string), and updates `max_jump` accordingly.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the highest jump calculated, which is the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string while jumping only on vowels.

The logic effectively ensures that it considers the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels, as well as the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, fulfilling the problem's requirement to find the minimum jump ability needed.

As a result, the program adheres to the defined problem description in all potential cases for the input specification.
