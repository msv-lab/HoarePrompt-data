Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `((n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`, while `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s` (if any) and remains -1 if there are no vowels, under the condition that `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`.***
