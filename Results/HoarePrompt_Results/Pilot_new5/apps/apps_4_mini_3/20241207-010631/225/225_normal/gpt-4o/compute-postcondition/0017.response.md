To evaluate the impact of the code snippet on the program:

1. The variable `max_jump` is updated using the `max` function, which computes the maximum of its two arguments: the current value of `max_jump` and the result of the expression `len(s) - prev_pos`.
2. `len(s)` gives the length of the string `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
3. `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found or -1 if no vowels were found. 
4. If there are no vowels in the string, `prev_pos` is -1, making `len(s) - prev_pos` equal to `len(s) + 1`.
5. Therefore, the new value of `max_jump` will depend on the comparison between its current value and the calculated value based on the length of the string and the position of the last vowel.

The output state reflects the updated value of `max_jump`, while `s` and `prev_pos` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found or -1 if no vowels were found, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `len(s) - prev_pos`.**
