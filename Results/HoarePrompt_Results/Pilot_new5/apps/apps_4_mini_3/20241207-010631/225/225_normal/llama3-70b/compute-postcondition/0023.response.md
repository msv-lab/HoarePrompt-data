Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `last_vowel` is 1 if the character at index 1 of `s` is a vowel. If `last_vowel` is -1, `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, 3). Otherwise, `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, (2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1).***
