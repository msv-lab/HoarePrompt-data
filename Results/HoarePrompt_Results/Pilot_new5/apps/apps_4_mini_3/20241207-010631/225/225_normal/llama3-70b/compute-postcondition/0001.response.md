The variable `vowels` is assigned the string `'AEIOUY'`, which contains the uppercase vowels. The value of `s` remains unchanged as the code only affects the variable `vowels`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, and `vowels` is the string 'AEIOUY'.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'**
