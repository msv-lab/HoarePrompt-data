The `max_jump` variable is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. Since `i` is currently 0, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 1. Therefore, `max_jump` will be updated to the maximum of its previous value (which is 0) and 1. As a result, `max_jump` will be set to 1, since it is the higher value.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `max_jump` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is in the set of vowels. The value of `last_vowel` is -1.**
