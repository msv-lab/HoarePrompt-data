Functionality: ** The function reads a non-empty string of capital English letters from input and computes the maximum "jump" based on the positions of vowels within that string. If there are no vowels, the maximum jump will remain as 0. If vowels are present, it calculates the maximum distance between consecutive vowels and considers the distance from the start of the string to the first vowel, as well as from the last vowel to the end of the string. The computed maximum jump is then printed. The function does not return any value. **
