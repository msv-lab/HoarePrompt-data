Output State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` is less than or equal to `n`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - (k + 1) * house_cost`, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is equal to the maximum number of cars that can be purchased without exceeding `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, and if `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the program returns 'YES'. If the loop does not execute, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses` and is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
