Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is at most `n // 1234567`, `b` is at most `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`, `c` is a non-negative integer determined by `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234` such that the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n` is satisfied. If no combination of non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` exists such that the equation holds, the program will not print 'YES' and will terminate after evaluating all possible values of `a` and `b`.**
