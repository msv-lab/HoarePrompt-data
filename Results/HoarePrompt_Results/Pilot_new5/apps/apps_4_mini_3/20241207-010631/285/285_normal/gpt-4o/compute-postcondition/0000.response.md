The variable `house_cost` is assigned the value `1234567`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and continues to be a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; house_cost` is `1234567`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; house_cost` is `1234567**
