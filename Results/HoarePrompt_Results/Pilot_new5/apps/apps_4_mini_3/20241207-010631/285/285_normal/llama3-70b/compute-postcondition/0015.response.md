The code `print('YES')` outputs the string 'YES'. It does not change any of the variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`). Therefore, the output state will include the initial conditions of the variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 246912; `a` is 0; `b` is 2; `c` is equal to (n - 246912) // 1234; 'YES' has been printed.**
