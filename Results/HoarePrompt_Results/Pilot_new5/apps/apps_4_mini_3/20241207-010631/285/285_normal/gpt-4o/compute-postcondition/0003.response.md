According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n` and `house_cost`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n // house_cost`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `n // house_cost` must be at least `0`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `house_cost` is `1234567`, the calculation `n // house_cost` will yield `0` if `n < house_cost`, which means the loop will not execute if `n` is less than `1234567`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `house_cost` (i.e., `n` must be greater than or equal to `1234567`).

At the start of the loop, the variable `a` will initialize to `0` for the first iteration. 

Thus, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`n` must be at least `1234567`, `a` is 0**
