The `exit()` statement causes the program to terminate immediately. As a result, no changes are made to any of the variables, and the program ends without any further actions. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 246912; `a` is 0; `b` is 2; `c` is equal to (n - 246912) // 1234; 'YES' has been printed; the program has exited.**
