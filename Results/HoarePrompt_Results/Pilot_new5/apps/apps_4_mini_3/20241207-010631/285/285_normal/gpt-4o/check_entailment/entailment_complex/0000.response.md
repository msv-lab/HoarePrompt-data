Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The task is to determine if there exist non-negative integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) such that:
   \[
   a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n
   \]
   This means that after buying \( a \) houses, \( b \) cars, and some \( c \) computers, Kolya should be able to spend exactly \( n \) game-coins.

2. **Implementation Breakdown**: 
   - The function `func_1(n)` initializes the costs of houses, cars, and computers.
   - It iterates over possible values for \( a \) (the number of houses). For each \( a \), it calculates the remaining coins after purchasing \( a \) houses.
   - It then iterates over possible values for \( b \) (the number of cars) and calculates the remaining coins after purchasing \( b \) cars.
   - The final condition checks if the remaining coins can be evenly divided by the cost of a computer (i.e., \( c \) can be some non-negative integer). If it can be, the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Completeness**: The nested loops ensure that all combinations of houses and cars are checked for every possible number of houses. If no valid combination is found that satisfies the conditions, the function returns 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program accounts for all possible values of \( n \) within the specified range (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)). The logic effectively explores every combination of purchases, thus covering all edge cases.

5. **Output Consistency**: The output of the program is consistent with the requirements specified in the problem description. It returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether a valid combination was found.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly determines whether Kolya could have spent exactly \( n \) game-coins on the specified items.
