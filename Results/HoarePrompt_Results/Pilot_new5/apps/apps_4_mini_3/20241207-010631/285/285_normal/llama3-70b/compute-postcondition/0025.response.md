Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, and `c` is equal to (n - 1234567) // 1234. The program has exited if the equation a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 equals `n`. Otherwise, if the equation does not hold true, the program continues without exiting.***
