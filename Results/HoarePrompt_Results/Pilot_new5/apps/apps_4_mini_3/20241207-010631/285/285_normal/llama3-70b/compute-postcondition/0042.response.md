The code `exit()` is invoked, which terminates the execution of the program. No variables are modified, and the program will stop running. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program has finished executing, and no further operations will take place.

Output State: **`n` is at least `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, `c` is `(n - 2469134) // 1234`, and 'YES' has been printed. The program has exited.**
