The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, the function may return various outputs based on the conditions checked. 

- In Cases 1 to 9, the function returns 'YES', indicating that various conditions regarding the values of `n`, costs associated with houses, cars, and computers, and the remaining amounts after purchases are satisfied. 
- In Case 10, the function returns 'NO', indicating that there is no valid combination of houses and cars such that the remaining amount is divisible by the computer cost. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return 'YES' or 'NO' based on a series of conditions related to costs and remaining amounts after potential purchases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether certain purchase conditions related to houses, cars, and computers are satisfied.**
