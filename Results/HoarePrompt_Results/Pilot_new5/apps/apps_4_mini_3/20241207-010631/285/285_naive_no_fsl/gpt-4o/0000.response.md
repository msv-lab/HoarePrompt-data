Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a solution to the problem of determining whether Kolya can spend exactly `n` game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. 

Here's the breakdown of how it works:

1. The program first reads the integer input `n`, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score.
2. It defines the costs of a house, car, and computer.
3. It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible numbers of houses (`a`) that Kolya could buy. The outer loop runs from 0 to the maximum number of houses he could afford with `n`.
4. For each possible number of houses, it calculates the remaining coins after purchasing those houses.
5. It then uses another loop to iterate over possible numbers of cars (`b`) that Kolya could buy with the remaining coins. The inner loop runs similarly based on the remaining amount after buying houses.
6. After determining how many cars he can buy, the program checks if the leftover coins can exactly be spent on computers. This is done by checking if the remaining amount is divisible by the cost of a computer.
7. If any combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `c` is determined from the remaining coins) satisfies the equation, it returns "YES".
8. If no such combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, it returns "NO".

The program handles the constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) well and checks every potential combination of purchases to ensure it covers all possible cases. 

Thus, no potential case exists where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement. Hence, the correctness is confirmed as **True**.
