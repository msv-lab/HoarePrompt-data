To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program in the context of various potential inputs.

The problem revolves around maximizing points that Polycarp can earn based on the time he has and the subtasks he can complete. The program processes this by trying to maximize the number of complete tasks (each giving `k + 1` points) he can perform within the given time `M`, and then calculating how many additional subtasks he can complete afterward from the remaining time.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the code:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of tasks `n`, number of subtasks `k`, and total available time `M`, as well as the time required for each subtask.
  
2. **Total Time Calculation**: It calculates the total time required to complete a single task (`total_time_per_task`), which is the sum of the times for all subtasks.

3. **Main Logic Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over the number of complete tasks Polycarp can solve, from 0 to `n`.
   - For each potential number of complete tasks, it checks if the time used exceeds `M`. If it does, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Points are calculated based on the number of complete tasks.
   - It then calculates how many additional subtasks can be completed with the remaining time after completing the full tasks.

4. **Subtask Calculation**: The inner loop determines how many subtasks can be completed with the leftover time, considering the time required for each subtask.

5. **Result Calculation**: It updates the maximum points achieved based on completed full tasks and additional subtasks.

### Potential Cases:

1. **Edge Case**: If `M` is 0, Polycarp cannot complete any tasks or subtasks. The expected output should be 0 points, and the program handles this correctly by not entering the loop for complete tasks.

2. **Single Task with Time Equal to Subtask Time**: If `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `M = t[0]`, the program should return 2 points (1 for completing the subtask and 1 for completing the task). The program correctly computes this.

3. **Maximum Input Values**: For extreme values of `n`, `k`, and `M`, the program needs to ensure that integer overflow does not occur (though Python's integers are unbounded). 

4. **Completing Full Tasks with Extra Time**: The program should correctly add points for additional subtasks after completing full tasks. If the remaining time is adequate to solve additional subtasks, it should calculate how many can be solved without exceeding the allowed tasks.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program in light of potential edge cases and the provided examples, I find that the logic handles various scenarios correctly and adheres to the constraints specified in the problem description. 

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program accurately calculates the maximum points Polycarp can earn for the given inputs adhering to the specified rules.
