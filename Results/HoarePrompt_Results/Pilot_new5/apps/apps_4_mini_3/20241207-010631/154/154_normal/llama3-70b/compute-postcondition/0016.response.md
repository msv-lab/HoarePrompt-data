The code updates the `dp` array based on the maximum value derived from the current state and the previous states of `dp`. The specific values of `dp[i][j]` are recalculated by comparing the current value with a value obtained from the previous state `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

The impact on the program is that `dp[i][j]` will now hold the maximum of its current value and the calculated value from the previous state. The other variables such as `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is equal to `M + 1`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1).**
