The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `(M - time_used) % subtask_time // subtask_time`. Since `subtasks_solved` is initially equal to `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, the new value of `subtasks_solved` will now be `subtasks_solved + (M - time_used) % subtask_time // subtask_time`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is now equal to `(M - time_used) % subtask_time`, `total_time_per_task` remains as stated, `max_points` remains as stated, `complete_tasks` remains as stated, `subtask_time` is the second element in `t`, and `subtasks_solved` is now equal to `subtasks_solved + (M - time_used) % subtask_time // subtask_time`.
