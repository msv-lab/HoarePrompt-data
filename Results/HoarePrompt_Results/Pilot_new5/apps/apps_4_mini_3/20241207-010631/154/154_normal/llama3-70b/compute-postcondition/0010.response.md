According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to M (inclusive). The loop variable `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each iteration until it reaches M. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `j` would have been 1 less than the maximum value it can take, which is M. Since `j` increments by 1 in each iteration, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be adjusted to M. 

The state of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `dp` does not change as `j` increments. The only adjustment needed is to increase `j` from its last value to M.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, and `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) by (M + 1) initialized with 0s, `j` is M**
