According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to `k`, inclusive. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be incremented by 1, and it needs to be less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value (which is `k` at the last iteration) and needs to be increased to `k + 1` for the loop to potentially execute again.

However, since `i` is already equal to `k` at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop will increment `i` to `k + 1`, it means that `i` can no longer satisfy the loop's condition (`i` must be less than or equal to `k`). Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased to allow `i` to be within the valid range.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` must be at least 1 greater than current `k`, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp[k + 1][j]` contains the maximum number of items that can be selected from the first `k` items with a total weight not exceeding `j` for all `j` from 1 to `M`.**
