#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, M is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, and t is a list of k integers where each integer t[j] (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000) represents the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within 1 and 45, `k` is an integer within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is the highest points calculated based on the number of complete tasks and subtasks solved, `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks solved based on available time and `t`.
    return max_points
    #The program returns the highest points calculated based on the number of complete tasks and subtasks solved, where complete_tasks is equal to n and points is equal to n * (k + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n` and `k`, a non-negative integer `M`, and a list `t` of `k` integers representing the time required for each subtask. It calculates the maximum points that can be earned by completing entire tasks and subtasks within the given time limit `M`. The function specifically calculates the points based on the number of complete tasks and the total subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time after completing those tasks. It returns the maximum points obtained, which accounts for both complete and partial task completions.
