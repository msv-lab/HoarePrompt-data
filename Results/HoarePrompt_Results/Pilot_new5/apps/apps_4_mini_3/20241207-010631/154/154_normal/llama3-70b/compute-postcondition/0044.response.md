According to the code, for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the variables related to the loop. The loop iterates through `j` from 1 to `M`, which means that `j` must be less than or equal to `M`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `M` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for `j` equal to 3. For the loop to continue executing, the value of `j` should be 3 or greater but must remain within the bounds of `M`, which is at least 3 in this case.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is at least 1 greater than the current `k`, `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is 3, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.**
