To determine the necessary adjustments for the states so that the loop can execute, we will analyze the provided states and the loop conditions.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates for `j` in the range from 1 to `M + 1`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `M` is at least 1. 

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is between 1 and 45: This does not directly affect the loop execution.
   - `k` must be at least 1 greater than the current `k`: This does not directly affect the loop execution unless the loop body utilizes `k`.
   - `M` is at least 1: This is crucial because it determines the range for `j`. If `M` is less than 1, the loop won't execute.
   - `t` is a sorted list of integers: This does not directly affect the loop execution but could be relevant if the loop body interacts with this list.
   - `dp[k + 1][j]` contains the maximum number of items that can be selected from the first `k` items with a total weight not exceeding `j` for all `j` from 1 to `M`: This implies that the array is set up for the loop to operate correctly.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop is dependent on `M`, we need to ensure that `M` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. 
   - Since we don't have a specific current value of `k`, we should only note that it must be updated accordingly to allow the selection of items in the loop, but we won't change `k` here as the task does not specify a current value.
   - The state of `j` at the start of the loop iteration will be 1, as the loop starts from 1.

Taking this into account, the state adjustment would be as follows:

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` must be at least 1 greater than current `k`, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is 1**
