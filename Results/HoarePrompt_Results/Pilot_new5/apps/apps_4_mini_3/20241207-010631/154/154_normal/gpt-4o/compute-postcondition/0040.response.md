The code `remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` subtracts the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time` from `remaining_time`. 

Given that `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, the calculation simplifies to `remaining_time -= 0 * subtask_time`, which means `remaining_time` remains unchanged.

The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is either `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - sum(t)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0.
