To analyze the effect of the given code, we start by understanding the initial state and how the code modifies it.

Initial State: 
- `n` is at least 2
- `k` is at least 2
- `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `total_time_per_task` remains as stated
- `max_points` remains as stated
- `complete_tasks` remains as stated
- `subtask_time` is the third element in `t`
- `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`
- `remaining_time` is reduced by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`

Now, let's analyze the code:
```
remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
```

This line updates the `remaining_time` by reducing it by the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. 

`max_subtasks_for_this_task` has been defined as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Therefore, substituting this in:

`remaining_time` is reduced by `(remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`.

This means that `remaining_time` is being decreased effectively by the largest multiple of `subtask_time` that can fit into `remaining_time`. 

After executing this line, `remaining_time` will be updated to reflect the amount of time left after completing as many subtasks as possible given the constraint of `subtask_time`. The exact changes to `remaining_time` depend on its initial value and value of `subtask_time`.

The other variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `total_time_per_task` remains as stated, `max_points` remains as stated, `complete_tasks` remains as stated, `subtask_time` is the third element in `t`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `remaining_time` is reduced to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
