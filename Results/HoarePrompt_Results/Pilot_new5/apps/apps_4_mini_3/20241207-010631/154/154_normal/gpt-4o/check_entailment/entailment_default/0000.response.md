To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the problem requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Polycarp can solve `n` tasks, each with `k` subtasks.
2. It takes `t_j` minutes to complete the `j-th` subtask.
3. Completing all `k` subtasks for a task gives Polycarp `k + 1` points.
4. The goal is to maximize the number of points Polycarp can earn in `M` minutes.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points
```

1. The program first calculates the total time required to complete all subtasks for a task.
2. It iterates over the number of tasks that can be completed fully.
3. For each complete task, it computes the remaining time and counts how many subtasks can be solved with that time.
4. Finally, it updates the maximum points based on completed tasks and the maximum subtasks solved.

### Edge Case Considerations:
1. **Zero Time (M = 0)**: If `M` is 0, Polycarp cannot complete any subtasks or tasks, which should return 0 points.
2. **Single Task and Subtask**: If `n = 1`, `k = 1`, and `M` is less than or equal to the time of the first subtask, the function should return 0 or 1 points appropriately.
3. **Excessive Time**: If `M` is sufficiently large to complete all tasks and subtasks, the function should return the maximum points, which is `n * (k + 1)`.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function calculates the maximum points earned by completing full tasks and subtasks based on the remaining time after tasks are completed. This aligns with the logic in the code.

### Conclusion:
However, there is a critical oversight in the code's approach to counting the maximum subtasks:
- The inner loop that calculates `max_subtasks_for_this_task` does not correctly handle the allocation of remaining time across subtasks. It uses integer division that may lead to neglecting remaining time for subtasks that could be solved after the first few.
- Specifically, if there are enough remaining minutes to solve a subtask but not enough to complete a task, the program might miss out on additional subtasks that could be solved.

Considering the edge cases and the potential issues with time allocation, the code does not adhere strictly to the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not accurately calculate the maximum points for every possible scenario, particularly in how it allocates remaining time across subtasks.
