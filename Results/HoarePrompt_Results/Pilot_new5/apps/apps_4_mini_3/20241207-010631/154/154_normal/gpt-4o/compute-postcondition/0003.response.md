The code assigns the value of `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` to `time_used`. The variable `complete_tasks` is currently 0, and `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, which is the sum of the list `t`. Since `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` will also be 0, regardless of the value of `total_time_per_task`.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, and `time_used` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0.**
