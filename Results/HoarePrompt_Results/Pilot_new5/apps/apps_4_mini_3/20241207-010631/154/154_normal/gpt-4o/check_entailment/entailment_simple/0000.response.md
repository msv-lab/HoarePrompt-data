To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly captures the number of tasks (`n`), the number of subtasks (`k`), the available time (`M`), and the list of times required for each subtask (`t`). This aligns with the input requirements in the problem description.

2. **Calculating Total Time Per Task**: The program computes `total_time_per_task` as the sum of the times for all subtasks. This is correct, as it represents the total time required to fully complete a single task.

3. **Loop Over Complete Tasks**: The outer loop iterates over the number of complete tasks Polycarp can solve (from 0 to `n`). For each possible number of complete tasks:
   - It calculates the `time_used` for solving those complete tasks.
   - If `time_used` exceeds `M`, it breaks the loop, which is a logical step to avoid unnecessary calculations.

4. **Points Calculation**: For each iteration:
   - The program calculates the points earned for completing those tasks (`points` = `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`), which is correct as per the problem description.

5. **Remaining Time for Subtasks**: The program then calculates the remaining time after solving complete tasks and initializes `subtasks_solved` to count the number of additional subtasks that can be tackled with the remaining time.

6. **Inner Loop for Solving Subtasks**: This inner loop correctly iterates through each subtask time in `t`, determining how many additional subtasks can be solved with the remaining time. It adds the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved to `subtasks_solved`.

7. **Final Adjustment on Subtasks Solved**: The program ensures that `subtasks_solved` does not exceed the remaining number of possible subtasks (`(n - complete_tasks) * k`). This is important because Polycarp can only solve subtasks from the remaining tasks he hasnâ€™t completed, ensuring the constraints of the problem are respected.

8. **Updating Maximum Points**: Finally, it updates `max_points` with the maximum possible points calculated for that configuration.

9. **Return**: The function returns `max_points`, which is indeed the maximum points Polycarp can earn under the given constraints.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description and handles all required cases:

- It correctly calculates points for complete tasks.
- It optimally utilizes the remaining time to solve as many subtasks as possible based on the time constraints.
- It prevents counting more subtasks than are allowed given the number of tasks remaining.

Therefore, since the program meets all the requirements stated in the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
