Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, and `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) by (M + 1) initialized with 0s. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.***
