Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 0, `t` is a sorted list of integers, and `dp[k][j]` contains the maximum number of items that can be selected from the first `k` items with a total weight not exceeding `j` for all `j` from 0 to `M`. If `M` is 0, `dp` remains initialized with 0s.**
