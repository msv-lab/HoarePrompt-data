The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is either `max(max_points, k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is equal to `2 * sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - sum(t)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
