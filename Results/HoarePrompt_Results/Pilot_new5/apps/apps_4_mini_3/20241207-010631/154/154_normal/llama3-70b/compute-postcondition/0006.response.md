The statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, we need to determine the output state based on these assignments. 

Since `j` is 1, accessing `dp[i][j - 1]` refers to `dp[1][0]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and the structure of `dp` do not change; only the specific entry in the `dp` list is updated.

The output state reflects that `dp[1][1]` has now been updated to the value of `dp[1][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) by (M + 1) initialized with 0s, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[1][1]` is now equal to `dp[1][0]`.**
