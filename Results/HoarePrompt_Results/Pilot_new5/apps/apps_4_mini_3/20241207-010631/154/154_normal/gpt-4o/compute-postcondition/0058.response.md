Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000. If `time_used` is greater than `M`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `points`, `remaining_time`, and `subtasks_solved` remain as stated in the precondition.***
