The `t.sort()` method sorts the list `t` in place. As a result, the values in `t` will be ordered in ascending order. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 2Â·10^9 inclusive, `t` is a sorted list of integers created from user input.**
