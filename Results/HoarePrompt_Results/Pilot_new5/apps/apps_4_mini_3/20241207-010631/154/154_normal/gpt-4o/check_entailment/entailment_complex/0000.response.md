To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code step by step.

The problem requires us to calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn by completing tasks and subtasks given the constraints of time. The key components of the problem are:

1. Each task consists of `k` subtasks, and evaluating completion of all `k` subtasks gives `k + 1` points.
2. Time required to complete each subtask is given in a list `t`.
3. Polycarp has `M` minutes available to complete as many subtasks as possible.

### Breakdown of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads integers `n`, `k`, and `M`, and a list of integers `t` which represents the time required for each subtask.
   
2. **Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total time required to complete one task as `total_time_per_task = sum(t)`.
   - It then uses a loop to iterate from `0` to `n`, representing the number of completely solved tasks (`complete_tasks`).

3. **Completing Full Tasks**:
   - For each possible number of complete tasks, it checks if the time used for these complete tasks exceeds the available time `M`. If it does, it breaks out of the loop.
   - It calculates `points` earned from complete tasks as `points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.

4. **Calculating Remaining Time for Subtasks**:
   - It calculates how much time is left (`remaining_time`) after allocating time for complete tasks.
   - It then calculates how many subtasks can be solved with the remaining time.

5. **Maximize Points**:
   - The program maintains a variable `max_points`, which is updated with the maximum points calculated after considering both complete tasks and the maximum subtasks that can be solved.

6. **Returning Results**: Finally, it returns the highest points calculated.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- The program correctly identifies how to maximize points based on completing full tasks and solving as many subtasks as allowed within the remaining time.
- The calculations for points based on complete and partial task completion are accurate.
- The nested loop for subtasks ensures that the subtasks are solved in the best possible order based on available time.

### Conclusion

Given that the logic throughout the program aligns with the problem description and correctly implements the requirements for calculating maximum points, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**

The program does what the problem description asks for in every potential case, as it properly iterates through possible complete tasks and calculates the maximum points for subtasks within the available time limits.
