According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` starting from 1 to `M`. Thus, for the loop to execute, `M` must be at least 1. 

Since the state before the loop indicates that `M` is at least 1, it satisfies the condition for executing the loop. At the beginning of the loop, `j` must be initialized to 1, as the range starts from 1. 

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `j` is now 1.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum number of items that can be selected from the first `i` items with a total weight not exceeding `j` for all `j` from 1 to `M`, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 1**
