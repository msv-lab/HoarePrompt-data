Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key points illustrating why it is incorrect:

1. **Points Calculation Logic**: The problem states that Polycarp earns one point for each subtask completed and an additional point for completing all subtasks in a task. The program, however, calculates points based on the number of items selected from the list `t`, which represents the time required for each subtask, and simply counts how many subtasks can be solved within the time limit `M`. It does not differentiate between subtasks of different tasks or account for the additional point awarded for completing all subtasks of a task.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Setup**: The `dp` table is set up to count the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within a given time limit, but it does not keep track of completed tasks. The final output attempts to sum maximum items selected along with configurations where the total weight equals `M`, which is not aligned with the problem description that asks for the maximum points earned, rather than just maximum items selected.

3. **Completeness of Task Handling**: The program does not iterate over multiple tasks (`n` tasks), nor does it accumulate points effectively by considering the completion of entire tasks. It only focuses on solving as many subtasks as possible without recognizing the task structure and the extra point for completing a full task.

For these reasons, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
