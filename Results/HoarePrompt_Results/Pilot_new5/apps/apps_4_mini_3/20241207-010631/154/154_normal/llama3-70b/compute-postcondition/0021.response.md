In this code snippet, `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. The variable `i` is `k + 1`, and `j` is `1`. The value of `j - 1` calculates to `0`. 

Thus, `dp[k + 1][1]` is set to the value of `dp[k + 1][0]`. However, we must note that the initialization and what values `dp[k + 1][0]` hold are not specified in the initial state. Generally, it can be assumed that `dp[i][0]` could represent a base case (for instance, zero items can be selected when the weight limit is zero).

After this execution, the states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum number of items that can be selected from the first `i` items with a total weight not exceeding `j` for all `j` from 1 to `M`, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 1, and `dp[k + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[k + 1][0]`.**
