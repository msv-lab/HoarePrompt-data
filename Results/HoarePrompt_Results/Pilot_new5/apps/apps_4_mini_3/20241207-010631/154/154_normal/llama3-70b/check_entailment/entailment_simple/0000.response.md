The provided program is supposed to compute the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn by solving subtasks given a set of constraints. Let's analyze the program based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of tasks.
   - `k`: Number of subtasks per task.
   - `M`: Total time available.
   - `t`: List of times needed to solve each subtask.

2. **Points Calculation**:
   - 1 point for each solved subtask.
   - An additional point if all `k` subtasks of a task are completed.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The order of solving subtasks is arbitrary.
   - The program needs to maximize the points scored within the available time `M`.

### Program Logic
1. The program reads the inputs and sorts the time requirements for subtasks.
2. It initializes a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved using up to `j` minutes considering the first `i` subtasks.
3. The nested loop populates the `dp` table:
   - The outer loop iterates over each subtask.
   - The inner loop iterates over the available time from `1` to `M`.
   - It updates `dp[i][j]` based on whether the current subtask can be solved given the remaining time.

4. Finally, the program calculates the total points by summing the points from completed subtasks and the extra points for fully completed tasks.

### Correctness Evaluation
- The dynamic programming approach correctly accounts for the number of subtasks solved and considers the extra points for solving all subtasks of a task.
- The return statement correctly sums both the points for solved subtasks and the bonus points for completed tasks as described.

### Conclusion
The program does accurately implement the requirements of the problem description, utilizing dynamic programming to ensure optimal point calculation.

Therefore, based on the above analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
