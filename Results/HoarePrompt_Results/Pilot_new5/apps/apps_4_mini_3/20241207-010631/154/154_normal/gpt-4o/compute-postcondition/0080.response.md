To evaluate the impact of the code:

1. The variable `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`.
2. The values of `points` and `subtasks_solved` are used in the calculation:
   - `points` is defined as `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
   - `subtasks_solved` is updated to be `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`, reflecting the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved given the constraints.

Given that the exact values of `complete_tasks`, `k`, and `n` are not provided in the initial state, we do not know the specific numerical output for `max_points`. However, we can express the updates based on the formulas and constraints.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after all possible subtasks have been solved, `total_time_per_task` remains as stated, `max_points` is updated to be `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` remains as stated, `subtasks_solved` is updated to be `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`**.
