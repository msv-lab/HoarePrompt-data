The code assigns `max_points` the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. The values of `points` and `subtasks_solved` have not been specified but they are both non-negative integers. Therefore, `max_points` will be at least as large as it was before this operation, and it will increase if `points + subtasks_solved` is greater than the current `max_points`. 

Since we know `max_points` starts at 0, if `points` and `subtasks_solved` are both 0, `max_points` will remain 0. If either `points` or `subtasks_solved` is greater than 0, then `max_points` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is either `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0.**
