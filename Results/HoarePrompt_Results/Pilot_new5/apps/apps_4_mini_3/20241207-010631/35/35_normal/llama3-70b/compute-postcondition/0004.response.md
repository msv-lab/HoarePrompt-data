The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, the current value of `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
