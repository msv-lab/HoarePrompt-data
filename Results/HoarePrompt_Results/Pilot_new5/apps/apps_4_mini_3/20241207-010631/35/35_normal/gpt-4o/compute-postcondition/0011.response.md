The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. Since `high` is greater than `low`, `mid` will be a valid integer value that splits the range defined by `low` and `high`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers representing the number of plates and pieces of two cakes; `high` is equal to the previous value of `mid`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers representing the number of plates and pieces of two cakes; `high` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2.**
