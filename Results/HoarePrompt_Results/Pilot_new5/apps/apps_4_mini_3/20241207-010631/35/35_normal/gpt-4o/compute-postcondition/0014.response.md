The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. Since `high` is greater than `low`, this means `mid` will be a value that is between `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `high` is greater than `low`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
