#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers representing the number of plates and pieces of the two cakes. If the loop executed, it implies that `low` was initially less than `high`, and the maximum number of plates that can be distributed is `min(a, b)`. If `low` equals `high`, it indicates that the maximum number of plates has been determined.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1, where low is equal to min(a, b) + 1, indicating the maximum number of plates that can be distributed is min(a, b). Therefore, the output is min(a, b).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` represents the number of plates, `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake, and `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake. It determines the maximum number of plates that can be distributed evenly based on the minimum pieces available between the two cakes. The function returns `min(a, b)`, which represents the maximum number of plates that can be distributed, assuming the distribution can always be achieved if there are enough pieces.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates, such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns a boolean expression indicating whether the sum of pieces of cake a (divided by x) and pieces of cake b (divided by x) is greater than or equal to the number of plates n, where a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` and checks if the total number of pieces of two cakes (represented by non-negative integers `a` and `b`) can be divided into at least `n` plates, based on how many pieces each plate can hold. It returns a boolean indicating whether the sum of the integer division of `a` by `x` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. The correct values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are assumed to be set externally before the function is called, as they are not passed as parameters.
