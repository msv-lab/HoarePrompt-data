The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n` is an integer representing the number of plates (with constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (with constraints 1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (with constraints 1 ≤ b ≤ 100). The function calculates the minimum number of pieces between the two cakes, which is `min(a, b)`, and returns this value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and return the minimum number of pieces between the two cakes. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, and returns min(a, b), indicating the maximum number of plates that can be distributed based on the number of pieces of the two cakes.**
