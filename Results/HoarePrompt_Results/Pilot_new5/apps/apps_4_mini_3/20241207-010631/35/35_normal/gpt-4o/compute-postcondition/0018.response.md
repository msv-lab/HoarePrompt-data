Output State: **`low` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers representing the number of plates and pieces of the two cakes. If the loop executed, it implies that `low` was initially less than `high`, and the maximum number of plates that can be distributed is `min(a, b)`. If `low` equals `high`, it indicates that the maximum number of plates has been determined.**
