Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `x` is a minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` that has been decremented by 1. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the expression `(a - x + (b - x) >= x)` holds true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
