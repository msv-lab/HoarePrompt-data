The function accepts a positive integer `x` and checks if the total number of pieces of two cakes (represented by non-negative integers `a` and `b`) can be divided into at least `n` plates, based on how many pieces each plate can hold. It returns a boolean indicating whether the sum of the integer division of `a` by `x` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. The correct values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are assumed to be set externally before the function is called, as they are not passed as parameters.
