The value of `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. The variable `mid` can either be 1 or 2. Therefore, if `mid` is 1, then `low` becomes 2; if `mid` is 2, then `low` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100), `low` is either 2 or 3, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, `mid` is either 1 or 2, and the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns true.**
