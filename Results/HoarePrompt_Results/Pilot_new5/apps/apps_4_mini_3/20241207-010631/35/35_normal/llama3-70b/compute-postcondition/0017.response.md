The function `func` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, with constraints that `1 ≤ a ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. Additionally, there is a parameter `n`, which is also an integer, with the constraint `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`. The function does not explicitly return a value in the provided output description, so we cannot determine the specific output behavior based on the information given. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the integers `a`, `b`, and `n` within the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, both integers in the range of 1 to 100, and n, an integer in the range of 2 to a + b.**
