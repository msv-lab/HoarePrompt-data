Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` is a minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` decremented by 1. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
