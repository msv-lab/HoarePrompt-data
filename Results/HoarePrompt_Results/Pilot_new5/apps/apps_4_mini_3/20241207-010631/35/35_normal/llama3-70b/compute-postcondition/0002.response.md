According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once, regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `x`. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is min(n, a, b)**
