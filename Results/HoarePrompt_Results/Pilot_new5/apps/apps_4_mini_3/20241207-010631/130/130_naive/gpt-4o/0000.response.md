To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `N`: Total different collectible coins.
   - `M`: Number of Ivan's friends.
   - `K`: Number of coins Ivan already has.
   - `L`: Minimum number of new coins that must be gifted.

2. **Conditions**:
   - Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
   - All gifted coins must be different.
   - At least `L` of the gifted coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Logic of the Program:
- The program calculates `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend must gift, using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`. This is a way to perform a ceiling division to ensure that at least `L` new coins are gifted in total.
- Then, it checks if the total number of coins gifted (i.e., `M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the number of new coins available (i.e., `N - K`). If yes, it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **All Friends Gift New Coins**:
   - If `M` (number of friends) is greater than `N - K` (total new coins available), the program should immediately return `-1` since it's impossible to gift more distinct coins than available.
   
2. **Exact Match**:
   - If `M * min_x` exactly equals `N - K`, the program should correctly return `min_x`.

3. **Minimum Input Values**:
   - When `K = N`, i.e., Ivan already has all coins, then regardless of `M`, the output should be `-1` as no new coins are available.

4. **Valid Range Check**:
   - The program should handle large numbers, especially considering inputs close to `10^18`, ensuring that it does not lead to overflow or incorrect calculations.

### Testing for Bad Cases:
- Let's consider `N = 10, M = 5, K = 10, L = 1`. Here, `N - K` would be `0`, which implies that no new coins are available. The output should be `-1`, but the program will output `0` as it fails to check for the scenario where `K = N`.

Thus, we have identified a potential case where the program does not correctly satisfy the problem conditions. 

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

The program fails in cases where Ivan already has all coins (i.e., when `K` equals `N`). In such scenarios, the program will not return `-1` as expected but will incorrectly compute a non-negative number.
