Postcondition: ***`N` is the first input integer, `M` is the second input integer, `K` is the third input integer, `L` is the fourth input integer, where 1 <= `K` <= `N` <= 10^18, and 1 <= `M`, `L` <= 10^18. The current value of `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1`, and `M` is also greater than or equal to `L`.***
