Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the issues with the provided program:

1. **Condition for Gifted Coins**: The problem states that each friend must gift the same number of coins, and these coins must be different. The program only checks if the number of friends \( M \) is greater than or equal to \( N - K + 1 \) (the number of coins Ivan does not have) and if \( M \) is also greater than or equal to \( L \). This check is insufficient because it does not ensure that the friends can actually gift coins in equal amounts while also satisfying the condition that at least \( L \) coins gifted must be new.

2. **Minimum Coin Calculation**: The program outputs `1` if the conditions are met (i.e., if \( M \) is sufficient to cover new coins), but it doesn't consider how many coins each friend should actually give. The output should reflect the minimum number of coins each friend can gift while satisfying the equal gifting requirement.

3. **Invalid Scenarios Handling**: The program fails to account for scenarios where the conditions cannot be met, such as when \( M \) exceeds the total types of coins \( N \) or when \( K + L > N \), which would imply that it's impossible to have \( L \) new coins since there aren't enough types available.

In summary, the program lacks the necessary logic to fully solve the problem as stated, particularly in calculating the minimum coins per friend and handling various edge cases properly. Therefore, it does not adhere to the problem's requirements for every potential case.
