The function `func` accepts four parameters: `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. All parameters are integers, with the constraints that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq M, L \leq 10^{18}\). After executing the function body, the output is determined by specific conditions based on the values of these parameters. 

Since no specific output conditions or cases have been provided in the prompt, we cannot detail the return values. Therefore, we can only outline the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N, M, K, and L, which are integers constrained by 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= M, L <= 10^18. The specific return value is not defined in the given output.**
