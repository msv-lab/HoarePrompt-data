The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `a` is an empty list, `i` is equal to 0, `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, and the current value of `x` is less than or equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
