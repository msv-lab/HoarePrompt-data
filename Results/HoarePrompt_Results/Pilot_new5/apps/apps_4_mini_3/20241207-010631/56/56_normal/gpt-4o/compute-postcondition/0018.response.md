To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the provided state and the `while` condition.

The loop condition is `len(bits) < k`, which means that the loop will continue executing as long as the number of indices in `bits` that are set to 1 is less than `k`. 

**Given States:**
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18).
- `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5).
- `k` is less than or equal to `n`, meaning there are at least `k` bits available in the binary representation of `n` to be set.
- `bits` contains the indices of all the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`.
- The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`.

**Considering the states:**
- Since `bits` contains the indices of the set bits of `n`, the length of `bits` indicates how many bits are currently set to 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, we need `len(bits)` to be strictly less than `k`.

To ensure that the loop can execute once, we need the current length of `bits` to be less than `k`.

1. If `len(bits)` is already equal to `k`, then the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to modify the state such that `len(bits)` is less than `k`. 
2. Since `bits` must contain indices of bits that are actually set in `n`, having fewer set bits means the length of `bits` can be adjusted. 

**Conclusion:**
In order for the loop to execute for the first time, we can state that `len(bits)` must be less than `k`. As we know `len(bits)` is less than or equal to `k`, and to ensure the loop runs, we can say `len(bits)` must be less than `k`. This suggests the bits set in `n` is fewer than `k`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and len(bits) must be less than k**
