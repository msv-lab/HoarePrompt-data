To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the line `smallest = bits.pop()` on the initial state. The `pop()` method removes the last element from the list `bits` and returns it, assigning that value to the variable `smallest`. 

Since we do not have the initial values of `bits`, we can only infer the effects based on the operation:

- `smallest` will be assigned the value of the last element from the list `bits`.
- The list `bits` will be modified; specifically, it will lose its last element.

Since the specific initial values of `bits` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact value of `smallest`. However, we can indicate that `smallest` now holds the value that was the last element of `bits` before it was popped, and `bits` will contain all the elements except that last one.

Therefore, we state that:
- `smallest` is now the last element that was in `bits`.
- `bits` has had its last element removed.

Output State: **`smallest` is the last element of `bits` before pop, `bits` is the list without its last element.**
