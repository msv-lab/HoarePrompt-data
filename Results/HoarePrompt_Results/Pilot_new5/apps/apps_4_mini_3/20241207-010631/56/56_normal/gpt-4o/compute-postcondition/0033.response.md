The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both parameters are positive integers, where `n` is constrained to the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `k` is constrained to the range (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). 

After evaluating these parameters, the function executes the following logic:

- **Case 1:** If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- **Case 2:** If the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` is greater than `k`, the function returns 'No'.
- **Case 3:** If neither of the above conditions are fulfilled, the function returns 'Yes' followed by the elements of the list 'bits', which contains `k` elements sorted in descending order, joined into a string.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, check specific conditions regarding their values, and return a response indicating either a 'No' or a 'Yes' followed by a sorted string of elements based on the binary representation of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, and returns 'No' if k is greater than n or if there are more bits set to 1 in n than k. If neither condition is met, it returns 'Yes' followed by the k highest bits sorted in descending order.**
