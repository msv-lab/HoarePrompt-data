The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing the value of `x`, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
