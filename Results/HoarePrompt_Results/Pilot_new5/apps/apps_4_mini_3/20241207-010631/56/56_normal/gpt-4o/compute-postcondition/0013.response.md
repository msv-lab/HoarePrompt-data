Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and `i` is 58. If the bitwise operation `n >> i & 1` is true, then `bits` contains the value 58 three times if it initially contained it twice; otherwise, it contains 58 once plus whatever was there before.***
