According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is within the range specified, which is from 60 down to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 59. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 58. 

The loop will still be valid as long as `i` is non-negative. The value of `n` and `k` does not change during the iteration, and their constraints remain the same. The conditions regarding the bitwise operation and the `bits` list are also relevant but do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the states will be:
- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18)
- `k` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5)
- `i` will be 58

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 58. If the bitwise operation `n >> i & 1` is true, then the list `bits` contains the value 58 twice.**
