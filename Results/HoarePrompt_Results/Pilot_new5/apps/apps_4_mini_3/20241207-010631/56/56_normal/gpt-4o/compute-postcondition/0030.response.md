Output State: **`bits` contains `k` elements, where each element is a non-negative integer. If `k` was initially greater than the original length of `bits`, the loop would not execute, and `bits` would remain unchanged. If `k` was less than or equal to the original length of `bits`, then `smallest` will be the smallest index from the original `bits` during the final iterations.**
