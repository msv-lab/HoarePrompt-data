The `bits` list is updated by appending the value `smallest - 1` to it. The value of `smallest` is unchanged, but `bits` now contains an additional element which is one less than `smallest`. Therefore, the Output State is: `smallest` is the last element of `bits` before pop, `bits` is the list that now includes the new element `smallest - 1`.

Output State: **`smallest` is the last element of `bits` before pop, `bits` is the list with the new element `smallest - 1` appended.**
