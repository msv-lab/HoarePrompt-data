The value of `i` is used to append to the list `bits`. Since the initial state specifies that if the bitwise operation `n >> i & 1` is true, then the list `bits` contains the value 58 twice. The operation does not change the values of `n`, `k`, or `i`, but it modifies the list `bits` by appending `i`. 

Given that `i` is 58, the list `bits` will now contain the value 58 an additional time, regardless of what it contained before.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 58, and `bits` contains the value 58 three times if it initially contained it twice; otherwise, it contains 58 once plus whatever was there before.**
