To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1(n, k)`.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Find `k` integers such that the sum of `2` raised to the power of each integer equals `n`, while minimizing the largest integer in the sequence and ensuring the sequence is lexicographically largest.
2. **Input Constraints**: 
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, immediately return "No".
   - If there are more bits set to `1` in the binary representation of `n` than `k`, also return "No".
3. **Generating Sequence**:
   - If the number of bits set to `1` is less than `k`, split the highest powers of two (represented in `bits`) until you have `k` elements.
   - Sort the result in descending order to ensure it's lexicographically largest.

### Program Logic:
1. **Initial Check**: The program correctly checks if `k` exceeds `n` and returns "No" for such cases.
2. **Bit Count Check**: It counts the set bits in `n` and returns "No" if this count exceeds `k`.
3. **Expanding to `k` Elements**: The while loop effectively expands the set bits into `k` elements by reducing the largest bit and duplicating it, which means it will always yield a valid representation as long as the previous checks passed.
4. **Sorting and Formatting the Output**: The program sorts the resultant bits in reverse order and formats the output as required.

### Correctness Assessment:
- **Valid Cases**: The program correctly returns "Yes" and the required sequence for valid inputs that meet the described conditions.
- **Invalid Cases**: It also correctly identifies impossible cases and returns "No".
- **Output Format**: The output format adheres to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program fully aligns with the requirements of the problem description for every potential case outlined. It comprehensively checks the necessary conditions and generates the required output correctly.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
