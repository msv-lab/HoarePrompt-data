The `print('No')` statement outputs the string `'No'` to the console. The values of `n` and `k` do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state maintains the conditions regarding `n` and `k` but includes the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer assigned a new value based on input, `k` is a positive integer assigned a new value based on input, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`, and 'No' has been printed.**
