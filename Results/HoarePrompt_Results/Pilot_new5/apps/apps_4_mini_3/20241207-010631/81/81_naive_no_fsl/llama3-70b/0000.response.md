To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider the requirements:

1. The program is supposed to count pairs (a, b) such that:
   - GCD(a, b) = x
   - LCM(a, b) = y
   - l ≤ a, b ≤ r

2. The program iterates through possible values for `a` and `b`, where `b` starts from `a` to avoid duplicate pairs.

3. The GCD and LCM are computed using two functions: `func_1` for GCD and `func_2` for LCM. 

### Key Considerations:
- For the solution to exist, `y` must be divisible by `x`. This is because the relationship between GCD and LCM is given by the formula:
  
  \[
  GCD(a, b) \times LCM(a, b) = a \times b
  \]

  If `GCD(a, b) = x` and `LCM(a, b) = y`, then from the above relationship, we know that \( a \) and \( b \) must be multiples of \( x \).

- Therefore, checking the condition `if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:` directly in the loops without considering the divisibility condition could lead to incorrect results if `y % x != 0`.

### Finding a Counterexample:
- Consider the input: `l = 1`, `r = 10`, `x = 1`, `y = 3`.

In this case:
- The pairs (a, b) that provide a GCD of 1 and LCM of 3 are (1, 3) and (3, 1). 
- However, pairs like (1, 2) and (2, 1) would also be counted incorrectly since GCD(1, 2) = 1 and LCM(1, 2) = 2.

The program currently does not verify that `y` is a multiple of `x` before proceeding with the main logic. This could lead to incorrect counts in various scenarios, specifically when `y` is not a multiple of `x`.

### Conclusion:
Due to the missing check for the relationship between `x` and `y`, it is possible for the program to return an incorrect count of good pairs.

Correctness: **False**
