To analyze the loop's output state, we review the code provided and the initial conditions:

Initial State: `a` is a positive integer, and `b` is a non-negative integer (i.e., `b >= 0`). 

The loop code:
```
while b:
    a, b = b, a % b
```

### Analyzing the Loop Execution
1. **First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute, `b` must be greater than 0.
   - After the first execution, `a` takes the value of the previous `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b` (which is less than `b` since the modulus operation results in a remainder).
   - Here, `a` remains greater than 0 because the previous value of `b` is at least 1.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - The loop can execute a second time if the new value of `b` (which is `a % b`) is still greater than 0.
   - If `b` becomes 0, the loop terminates. Otherwise, `a` is again updated with the most recent `b`, and `b` is updated with the modulus operation.

3. **Final State**:
   - The loop continues until `b` becomes 0. The final state of `a` represents the last non-zero value of `b`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`.
   - When the loop exits, `b` will be 0, indicating the end of the process.

### Output State
After all iterations of the loop have executed, the output state reflects that:
- `b` is 0 (the loop terminates when `b` reaches 0).
- `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`.**
