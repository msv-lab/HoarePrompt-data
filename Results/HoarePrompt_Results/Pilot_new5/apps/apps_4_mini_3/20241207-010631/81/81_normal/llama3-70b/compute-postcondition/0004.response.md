According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will only execute if `b` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be adjusted to a non-zero value. Given that `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, `a` must also be adjusted to reflect a value greater than 0 to satisfy the condition of the loop on the next iteration. 

Since `a` is stated to be greater than 0 already, we can keep its value as is, but we need to ensure `b` is set to a non-zero value.

State: **`a` is greater than 0; `b` must be greater than 0; `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`**
