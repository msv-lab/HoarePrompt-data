Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y` are integers within their specified ranges. If `z` is divisible by 3, then if `a` is equal to `b`, `count` is increased by 3; otherwise, `count` is increased by 2. In both cases, `z` remains greater than 4, `i` is 3, `a` is updated to `3 * x`, and `b` is calculated as `z // 3 * x`.***
