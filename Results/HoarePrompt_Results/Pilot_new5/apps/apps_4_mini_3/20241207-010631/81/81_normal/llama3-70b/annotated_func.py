#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where a > 0 and b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` (where `a > 0`) and `b` (where `b >= 0`), and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially 0, the function will return `a`, which is the expected behavior when calculating GCD. The function handles the case where `b` is 0 directly by returning `a` without further computation. If `b` is greater than 0, it uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD by repeatedly updating `a` and `b` until `b` becomes 0. The final result is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 0 and b > 0.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of a multiplied by b, divided by the result of func_1(a, b), where a and b are integers greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the result of the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. If `func_1(a, b)` returns 0, this will result in a division by zero error.
