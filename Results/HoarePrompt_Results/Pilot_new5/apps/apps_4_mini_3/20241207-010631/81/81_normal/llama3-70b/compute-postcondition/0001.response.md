The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers greater than 0. After executing the function body, it returns the result of `a` multiplied by `b`, divided by the result of another function `func_1(a, b)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` (both greater than 0) and return the result of the calculation involving multiplication and division based on the results of `func_1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, returns the result of a multiplied by b, divided by the result of func_1(a, b), with both a and b being integers greater than 0.**
