Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y` are integers within their specified ranges. If `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r` such that `math.gcd(a, b) == x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, then if `a` is equal to `b`, `count` is set to 1 and `a` remains equal to `b`. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 2, indicating that `a` is not equal to `b`. The current value of `z` remains divisible by `i`, which is equal to 1.***
