You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, x, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if (y % x != 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, which is a fixed integer value, regardless of the values of l, r, x, and y.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9. Additionally, `y` is divisible by `x` (i.e., `y % x = 0`).
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and math.gcd(a, b
                ) == x and a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y:
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l`, `r`, `x`, `y` are integers within their specified ranges. `count` represents the total number of valid pairs `(a, b)` found such that `l <= a <= r`, `l <= b <= r`, where `a` and `b` are derived from the divisors of `z` and satisfy `math.gcd(a, b) == x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`. If the loop does not execute, `count` remains 0.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of valid pairs (a, b) found such that l <= a <= r, l <= b <= r, where a and b are derived from the divisors of z, satisfying math.gcd(a, b) == x and a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y. If no valid pairs are found, count remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`. It returns 0 if `y` is not divisible by `x`. If `y` is divisible by `x`, the function calculates the integer `z = y // x` and counts the valid pairs `(a, b)` where both `a` and `b` are derived from the divisors of `z`, fall within the range `[l, r]`, have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x`, and satisfy the relationship `a * b // GCD(a, b) == y`. The function returns the total count of such valid pairs found. If no valid pairs are found, it returns 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
