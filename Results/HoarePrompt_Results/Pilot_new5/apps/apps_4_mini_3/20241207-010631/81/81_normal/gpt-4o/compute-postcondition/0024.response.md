Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y` are integers within their specified ranges, `count` is increased by 2. If `z` is divisible by `i` (which is 2), and if `a` equals `b`, then `count` is further increased by 3, with `z` remaining at least 4, `i` being 2, `a` being equal to `2 * x`, and `b` being equal to `z // 2 * x`. Otherwise, if `a` does not equal `b`, `count` is increased by 2, with `z` still being at least 4 and `i` being 2, along with the same definitions for `a` and `b`.***
