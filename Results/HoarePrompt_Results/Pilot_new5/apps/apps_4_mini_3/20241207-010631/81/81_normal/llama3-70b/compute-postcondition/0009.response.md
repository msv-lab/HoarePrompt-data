Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` (where `a > 0`) and `b` (where `b >= 0`), and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially 0, the function will return `a`, which is the expected behavior when calculating GCD. The function handles the case where `b` is 0 directly by returning `a` without further computation. If `b` is greater than 0, it uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD by repeatedly updating `a` and `b` until `b` becomes 0. The final result is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.**
