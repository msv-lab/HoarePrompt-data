The variable `b` is assigned the value of `z // i * x`. Given that `y` is divisible by `x`, we know that `z` (which is `y // x`) is also a non-negative integer. The variable `i` has a current value of 1, which means `z // i` equals `z`. Thus, we can express `b` as `b = z * x`.

Furthermore, since `z` is equal to `y // x`, we know that the value of `b` can be expressed as `b = (y // x) * x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `r` is an integer between `l` and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `y` is an integer between `x` and 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `y`, and the current value of `z` is divisible by `i`.**
