The variable `z` is assigned the value of `y // x`, which represents the integer division of `y` by `x`. Since it is given that `y` is divisible by `x`, the result of this division will be an integer value. The other variables `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, and `z` is equal to `y // x`.**
