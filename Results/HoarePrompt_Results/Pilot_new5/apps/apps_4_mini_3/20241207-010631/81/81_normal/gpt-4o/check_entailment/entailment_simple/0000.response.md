To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly counts the number of good pairs of integers \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions specified.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input values \(l\), \(r\), \(x\), and \(y\) as integers.
   
2. **Divisibility Check**:
   - The program first checks if \(y\) is divisible by \(x\). If \(y\) is not divisible by \(x\), it returns 0. This condition is necessary because if \(GCD(a, b) = x\) and \(LCM(a, b) = y\), then for \(LCM(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{GCD(a, b)}\), it follows that \(y\) must indeed be divisible by \(x\).

3. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program calculates \(z = \frac{y}{x}\) and then finds all pairs of integers \((a, b)\) by iterating through the divisors of \(z\). For each divisor \(i\), it computes \(a = i \cdot x\) and \(b = \frac{z}{i} \cdot x\).

4. **Validating Pairs**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\):
     - It checks if \(l \leq a \leq r\) and \(l \leq b \leq r\).
     - It checks if \(GCD(a, b) = x\) and \(LCM(a, b) = y\) using the formulas for GCD and LCM.
     - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are valid, it counts the pair, taking care to count \((a, b)\) and \((b, a)\) as distinct when \(a \neq b\).

5. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the program returns the count of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to count the number of good pairs \((a, b)\) within the specified range \([l, r]\) such that \(GCD(a, b) = x\) and \(LCM(a, b) = y\). It properly handles the conditions and computations necessary according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
