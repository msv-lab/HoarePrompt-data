The function `coverage` accepts three parameters: `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers representing the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the scoop-net, and `r`, which is a positive integer representing the radius of the scoop-net. Additionally, the function operates within the constraints of the pond dimensions defined by `n` (the width) and `m` (the height), where `n` and `m` are positive integers. After executing the function body, it returns the area of the scoop-net defined by the coordinates `(x, y)` and radius `r`, taking into account the edges of the pond as defined by its dimensions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y (non-negative integers), and r (a positive integer). It returns the area of the scoop-net defined by the coordinates (x, y) and radius r within the dimensions (n, m) of the pond.**
