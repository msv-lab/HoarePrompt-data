The variable `total_coverage` is decremented by the value of `cov`, which was assigned from the popped tuple from `heap`. Since `total_coverage` was initially 0, the new value will be `0 - cov`, resulting in a negative value. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `heap`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `(n * m - 1)` tuples, `total_coverage` is `-cov`, `cov`, `x`, `y` are assigned values from the popped tuple from `heap`.**
