According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and the parameter `m`. If `y` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1, making `y` equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1**
