The code snippet pushes a new tuple onto the `heap` list. The first element of the tuple is the negative value of `coverage(x, y)`, and the second and third elements are the current values of `x` and `y`, respectively. 

Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 0, the expression `coverage(x, y)` will be evaluated, resulting in some value which we will denote as `c`. Consequently, `-coverage(x, y)` becomes `-c`. 

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `k`) are not affected by this operation, and the `heap` list will have one new entry after the operation.

The output state reflects that `heap` now contains a tuple with values `(-c, 0, 0)`, where `c` is the return value of `coverage(0, 0)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**
