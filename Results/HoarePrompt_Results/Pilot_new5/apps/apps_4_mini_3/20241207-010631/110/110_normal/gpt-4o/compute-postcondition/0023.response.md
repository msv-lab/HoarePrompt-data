The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a new tuple into the `heap`. The tuple consists of three elements: 
1. The first element is `-coverage(x, y)`, which is the negative value of the function `coverage` evaluated at `x` and `y`. 
2. The second element is `x`, which is currently 2. 
3. The third element is `y`, which is currently also 2. 

Since `x` and `y` both remain unchanged after this operation, and `heap` will now contain an additional tuple, we need to highlight that `heap` is updated.

The output will reflect that `heap` now contains one additional tuple with specific values based on the function `coverage(2, 2)`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains the original `m + 1` tuples plus the tuple `(-coverage(2, 2), 2, 2)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2**
