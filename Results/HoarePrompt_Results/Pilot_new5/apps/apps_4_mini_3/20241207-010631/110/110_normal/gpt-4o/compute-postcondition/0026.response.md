Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each `x` in the range from `0` to `n-1` and each `y` in the range from `0` to `m-1`, `total_coverage` is 0.**
