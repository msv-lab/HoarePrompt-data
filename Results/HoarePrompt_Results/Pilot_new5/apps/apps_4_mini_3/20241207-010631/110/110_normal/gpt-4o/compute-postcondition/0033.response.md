According to the code, the loop executes a fixed number of times determined by the variable `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer, meaning that there is still a chance to execute the loop again if `k` is greater than the current iteration count. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we only need to adjust the value of `k` to reflect that one iteration has completed.

To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be decreased by 1. Therefore, since we are assuming the loop has been running for some iterations and now needs to be set for one more execution, we need to ensure that `k` is still greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `heap` contains `(n * m - 2)` tuples, `total_coverage` is `-2 * cov`, `cov`, `x`, `y` are assigned values from the popped tuple from `heap`.**
