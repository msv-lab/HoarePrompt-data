The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. 

- `n` is an integer that represents the number of cost values and must be between 1 and 30.
- `L` is a positive integer that serves as a threshold and must be between 1 and 10^9.
- `costs` is a list containing `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is a positive value ranging from 1 to 10^9.

After executing the function, it returns the minimum cost computed throughout the iterations of the loop, stored in the variable `answer`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list of positive integers `costs`, and return the minimum cost computed during its execution. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer), L (positive integer), and costs (list of positive integers), and returns the minimum cost computed throughout the iterations of the loop.**
