The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `c`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `L` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\).
- `c` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer \(c[i]\) satisfies \(1 \leq c[i] \leq 10^9\).

The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on their values; however, without additional context on the output, we can summarize the acceptance and constraints of parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), a positive integer `L` (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and a list `c` of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9 for each i).**
