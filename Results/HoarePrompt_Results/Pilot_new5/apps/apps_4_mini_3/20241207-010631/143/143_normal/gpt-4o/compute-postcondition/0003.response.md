According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`, which determines how many times the loop will iterate. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), the loop will execute exactly `n` times. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take values from 0 up to `n-1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting value for the first iteration.

The states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
- The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 0**
