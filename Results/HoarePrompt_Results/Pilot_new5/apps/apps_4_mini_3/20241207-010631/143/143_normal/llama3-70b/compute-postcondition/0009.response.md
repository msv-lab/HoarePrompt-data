Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 1, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is updated such that dp[1] is the minimum between its current value and dp[1 - vol] plus costs[j], where `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `vol` is 0 or 1, ensuring that the current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.***
