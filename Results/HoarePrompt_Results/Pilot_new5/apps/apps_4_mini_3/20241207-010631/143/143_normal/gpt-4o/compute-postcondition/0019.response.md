According to the code, the loop iterates from 30 down to 0 (inclusive). For this loop to execute correctly, `i` must start at 30, which it does according to the provided state. However, the variable `n` is also mentioned and is constrained between 1 and 30, and there's no direct indication of how `n` relates to the loop, but since the loop iterates over a fixed range (30 to 0), it won't affect the ability for the loop to execute.

At the start of the loop, we need to ensure that the loop can indeed execute, which requires no modification. The value of `i` is correctly set at the start to 30, and the loop will decrement `i` with each execution until it reaches -1.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 30, `dp` is updated accordingly, `answer` is `max_cost`, `current_cost` is 0**
