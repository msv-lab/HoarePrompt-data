Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and `c` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9, the code snippet provided is:

```
n, L = map(int, input().split())
```

In this snippet, `n` and `L` are being reassigned values based on user input, which means their previous values will be overwritten. The specific values will depend on the input provided at runtime.

Since the specific values of `n` and `L` are not given, we can only describe the impact of this code generically. Here is the output state considering that `n` and `L` will now hold the values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9; `n` and `L` have been updated to new integer values from input.**
