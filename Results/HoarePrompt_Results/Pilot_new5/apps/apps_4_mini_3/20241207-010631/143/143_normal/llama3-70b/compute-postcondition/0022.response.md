Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 2, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is updated such that `dp[1]` contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of `1` using the first `n` items, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `vol` is less than or equal to `i` (which is 2).***
