According to the code, the loop executes for `i` ranging from 1 to 30. Since the loop begins at `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized properly to start from 1. 

The `dp` array is updated prior to the loop, with elements from index 0 to `n-1` being updated to `min(dp[i], c[i])`, and the elements from index `n` to 30 remaining equal to `max_cost`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes correctly, we need to establish that `i` starts at 1 and acknowledge that the loop must be able to access `dp` and `c`. Since `n` is constrained between 1 and 30, we can assert that the relevant states for `dp` have been initialized properly.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated for `i` in range from 0 to `n-1`, and `dp[i]` is equal to `max_cost` for `i` from `n` to 30.**
