Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 28. If `L` is greater than or equal to 2^28, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`, and `answer` is updated to the minimum of the previous answer and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[28]`. Additionally, `L` is decreased by 268435456.***
