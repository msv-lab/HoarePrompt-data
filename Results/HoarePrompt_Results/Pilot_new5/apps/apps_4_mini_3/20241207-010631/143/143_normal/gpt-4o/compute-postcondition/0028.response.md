Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 29. If `L` is greater than or equal to 1 << i, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[29]`, `dp` is updated accordingly, `answer` is updated to min(previous answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]), and `L` is decremented by 536870912.***
