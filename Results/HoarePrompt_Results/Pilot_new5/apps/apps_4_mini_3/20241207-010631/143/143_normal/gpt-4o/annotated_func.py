#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), L is a positive integer (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and costs is a list of n integers where each c_i is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], c[i])` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, and `dp[i]` remains equal to `max_cost` for `i` from `n` to 30.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30); `i` is 31; for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` has been updated to `min(dp[i], c[i])`; for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`, where `dp[i]` was previously `max_cost`.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 0, `dp` remains updated accordingly, `current_cost` is the total cost accumulated based on `dp[i]` values, and `answer` is the minimum cost computed throughout the iterations of the loop.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum cost computed throughout the iterations of the loop, stored in the variable 'answer'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list of positive integers `costs`. It computes and returns the minimum cost based on a dynamic programming approach, where it considers both the costs provided in the list and the doubling of previous costs. The function effectively handles cases where `L` may be greater than the maximum representable value based on the number of bits calculated in the iterations. It ensures that the output reflects the minimum accumulated cost while adjusting for the available budget `L`.
