According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is between 1 and 30, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must still be less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 1 in order for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30) and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is updated to `min(dp[0], c[0])**
