The code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the minimum of its current value and twice the value of `dp[i - 1]`. The previous state indicates that, for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is equal to `max_cost`, and for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` has been updated. 

After executing the line of code, `dp[i]` will be adjusted for each `i` from `n` to 30 based on the existing values of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1]`. The previous values of `dp` for indices `n` to `30` could be `max_cost`, and the new values will depend on the result of `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30); `i` is 2; for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` has been updated; for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` where `dp[i]` was previously `max_cost`.**
