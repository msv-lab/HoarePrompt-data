Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 1, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is updated such that dp[1] is the minimum between its current value and dp[1 - vol] plus costs[j]; `vol` is 2 ** j - 1, where `j` is 1.**
