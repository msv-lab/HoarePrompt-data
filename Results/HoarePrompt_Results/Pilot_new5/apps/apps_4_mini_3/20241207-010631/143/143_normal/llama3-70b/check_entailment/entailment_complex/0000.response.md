Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Volume Calculation Error**: The program calculates the volume of each bottle type as `2 ** j - 1`, which means for `j = 0`, the volume is `0 liters`. This is incorrect because the problem description states that a bottle of type i has a volume of `2^(i+1) - 1 liters`, meaning for `j = 0`, the volume should be `1 liter`. Thus, the volumes are incorrect for all bottle types.

2. **Handling Exact Volume Requirement**: The program attempts to find the minimum cost to achieve exactly `L` liters. However, the problem states that you can buy at least `L` liters, meaning that the program should consider scenarios where buying larger volumes could also meet the requirement, even if they exceed `L`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming approach used in the program is designed to find the minimum cost for exactly `L` liters rather than at least `L` liters. This could lead to scenarios where the minimum cost for exact `L` liters is not the optimal cost for purchasing at least `L` liters.

4. **Return Value**: The program returns `-1` if it is not possible to achieve the exact volume of `L`, but according to the problem statement, it should always be possible to buy enough lemonade due to infinite availability of the bottles.

Due to these inconsistencies and errors, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
