The code updates the variable `answer` to be the minimum of its previous value and the expression `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`. The expression `(L > 0)` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `L`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30)
- `i` is 29
- If `L` is greater than or equal to `1 << i` (which is equal to 536870912), `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[29]`, and `dp` is updated accordingly.

The impact of the code on the variables is:
- The value of `answer` changes based on the given expression. 
- The values of `n`, `i`, `current_cost`, `dp`, and potentially `L` remain unchanged in this specific line of code as only `answer` is directly affected.

Therefore, the Output State must reflect the unchanged variables while including the updated state of `answer`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 29, `answer` is updated to min(previous answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[29])**.
