To determine the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let’s analyze the provided information step by step:

1. The loop iterates over a range defined from `1` to `31`, meaning it will execute for values of `i` from `1` up to `30` (inclusive).
   
2. The previous state indicates that for `i` from `n` to `30`, `dp[i]` is equal to `max_cost`. 

3. The line of code executed in the previous iteration is `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`. This means that during the last iteration, `i` was a certain value, and `dp[i]` was updated based on the minimum value comparison. 

4. Based on the loop's range and the operation performed, after executing the line, `i` would have been incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given all this information, we can summarize:

- The loop will execute again for the next value of `i`.
- Since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `30`, if we had just executed the loop body for `i = 2`, the next value of `i` will be `3`.
- The conditions for `dp` are still the same, where `dp[i]` for `i` from `n` to `30` continues to be updated based on the previous values.

Thus, the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30); `i` is 3; for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` has been updated; for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` where `dp[i]` was previously `max_cost`.**
