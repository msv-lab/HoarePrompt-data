The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `c[i]`. The variable `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1, falling within the range of 1 to 30. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30) and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dp[1]` is updated to `min(dp[1], c[1])**
