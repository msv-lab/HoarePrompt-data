The code updates the `dp[i]` values based on the previous values of the `dp` array. Specifically, it sets `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and twice the value of `dp[i - 1]`. The initial conditions include that for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` has already been updated. For `i` from `n` to 30, the `dp` values depend on the condition of `max_cost` previously applied to `dp[i]`.

Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, and since `i` is starting at 3, we will consider the impacts from `i = n` to `i = 30`. The exact values of `dp[i]` for these indices depend on their initial set values, but they will be updated to either their previous value or `dp[i - 1] * 2`, whichever is smaller.

The output state will reflect that `dp[i]` for `i` ranging from `n` to 30 has been adjusted accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30); `i` is 3; `dp[i]` is updated for `i` from `n` to 30 to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` where `dp[i]` was previously `max_cost`.**
