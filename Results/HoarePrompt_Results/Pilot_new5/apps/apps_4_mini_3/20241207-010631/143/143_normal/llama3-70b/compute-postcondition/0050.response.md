The code snippet outputs the value of `dp[L]` if it is not equal to `float('inf')`, indicating that it is possible to achieve volume `L` at a cost. If `dp[L]` equals `float('inf')`, it means that achieving volume `L` is not possible, and the code will output `-1`. Since the values of `n`, `L`, `c`, and `costs` are not directly changed by this print statement, we only need to update the output based on the condition.

Since `dp` is a list containing the minimum costs to achieve volumes, `dp[L]` could be a specific value or remain as `float('inf')`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the original values of `n`, `L`, `c`, and `costs`, and we will describe the status of `dp[L]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, the output is `dp[L]` if `dp[L]` != float('inf') else -1.**
