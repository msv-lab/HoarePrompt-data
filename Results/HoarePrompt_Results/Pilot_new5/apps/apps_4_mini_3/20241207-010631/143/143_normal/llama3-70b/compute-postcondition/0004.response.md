According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` ranging from 1 to `L`. Since `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, the loop will indeed execute if `L` is at least 1. 

At the start of the loop:
- The variable `i` needs to be initialized to 1 because the loop starts at that value.
- The state of `n`, `L`, `c`, and `costs` doesn't need to change for the loop to execute, as they fulfill the necessary conditions already.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 1, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is a list of L + 1 elements, `i` is 1**
