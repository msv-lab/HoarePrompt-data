Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 2, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is updated such that if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[2]` now contains the minimum value between its previous value and `dp[2 - vol] + costs[j]`, with `i` being 2 and `j` equal to 0.***
