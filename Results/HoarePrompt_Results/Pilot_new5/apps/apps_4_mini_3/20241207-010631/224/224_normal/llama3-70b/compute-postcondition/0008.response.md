The variable `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. The initial state indicates that `j` is equal to `f_max_n - 1`, and we know that `dp[j]` is updated but not its specific value. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `f_max_n`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
