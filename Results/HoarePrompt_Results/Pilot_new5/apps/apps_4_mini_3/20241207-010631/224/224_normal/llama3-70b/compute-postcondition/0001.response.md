The variable `dp` is assigned a list with `f_max_n + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations of integers from `1` to `n`, `dp` will now have a length of `f_max_n + 1`, and each element will be `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations of integers from 1 to n; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized with all elements as 0.**
