The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a non-negative integer `f_max_n` (where f_max_n must be greater than or equal to 1), and returns the value of `dp[f_max_n]`, which represents the number of ways to select `f_max_n` items from `n` distinct items, calculated using dynamic programming and taken modulo 10^9 + 7. It does not handle the case when `f_max_n` is less than 1 correctly, as the code assumes f_max_n is at least 1.
