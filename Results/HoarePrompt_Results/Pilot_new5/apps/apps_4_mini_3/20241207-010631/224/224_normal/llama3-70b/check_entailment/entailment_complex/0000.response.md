Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the edge case when `f_max_n` is less than 1, which is implicitly assumed in the annotations but not explicitly checked in the code. According to the problem description and the requirements, `f_max_n`, which represents the maximum value of `f(p)`, must be correctly calculated for all possible permutations of integers from `1` to `n`. 

In particular, we can observe that:

- In `func_2`, the calculation of `res` (the maximum GCD value) does not guarantee that `f_max_n` is always at least `1`, since it can be `0` if all `i` in the loop lead to `func_1(0, i)`, which will return `i` as the GCD for the first number and be `1` after that. However, if `n` is `2`, `f_max_n` could end up being `1`, and the program should ensure that this is positively accounted for.

- In `func_3`, if `f_max_n` is `0`, the indexing `dp[f_max_n]` would not be valid and could lead to an out-of-bounds error or an incorrect result since `dp` is initialized with `f_max_n + 1` size but the logic does not cover the case when `f_max_n` is `0`.

Furthermore, the examples in the problem statement show specific results for given values of `n` that should be met; if `f_max_n` is not calculated correctly due to the above issue, the result will not match the expected outputs.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to an overall conclusion of correctness as **False**.
