To process the code snippet provided, we need to focus on the variable `result`, which is affected by the execution of the code. 

1. The initial state has:
   - `result` = 6
   - `i` = 4
   - `mod` = positive integer (value not specified but remains positive)

2. The code `result = result * i % mod` will calculate a new value for `result`. In this case:
   - The multiplication of `result` (6) and `i` (4) gives us 24.
   - Next, we take `24 % mod`.

3. Since we don't have a specific value for `mod`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `result`. However, we know that `result` will be updated to the value of `24 % mod`.

4. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and all other variables (`mod`, `result`, and `i`) are still valid in the output state, but only `result` changes.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is a positive integer, `result` is 24 % mod, `i` is 4**
