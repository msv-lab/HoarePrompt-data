Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is `n`; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` is the sum of all original `dp[k]` for `k` from 0 to `f_max_n` modulo `MOD`, and for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of original `dp[j]` and original `dp[j - 1]`, all taken modulo `MOD`.**
