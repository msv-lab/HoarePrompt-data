The variable `result` is updated based on the expression `result = result * i % mod`. The initial value of `result` is 1, `i` is 2, and `mod` is a positive integer. After the operation, `result` will be equal to `(1 * 2) % mod`, which simplifies to `2 % mod`. Since `mod` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, the value of `result` will be 2 if `mod` is greater than 2, or potentially 0 or 1 if `mod` is 1 or 2, respectively.

The value of `n`, `mod`, and `i` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions, but `result` is now specifically determined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is a positive integer, `result` is 2 % mod, `i` is 2**.
