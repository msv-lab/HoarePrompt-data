According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `f_max_n`. The loop will execute again for the next value of `j` if `j` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, which means that for the next iteration, `j` will be `f_max_n - 1 - 1` (which is `f_max_n - 2`). For the loop to execute one more time, `f_max_n` must be at least 2 (since `j` must be greater than or equal to 1). 

Therefore, we can adjust the states as follows:
- `n` remains the same, as it does not affect the for loop.
- `i` remains 1, as it does not affect the for loop.
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (to ensure that `j` can be at least 1 in the next iteration).
- `j` will be updated to `f_max_n - 2` for the next iteration, indicating the decrement.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
