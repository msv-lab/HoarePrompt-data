The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder of `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`. The initial state indicates that `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, which is at least 1. Thus, `dp[j]` will be updated to `dp[f_max_n] % MOD`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] % MOD`**
