According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `f_max_n`. The loop will execute if `f_max_n` is at least 1, allowing the range to be valid since `j` starts at `f_max_n` and decrements down to 1. 

Given the conditions in the state:
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (which is satisfied as per the state).
- `j` is initialized to 0, but it will be overwritten when the loop starts since `j` is defined in the loop's range.

Since `f_max_n` is expected to be at least 1, `j` will start from `f_max_n` and decrement down to 1 for the loop to execute properly. 

Thus, the state before the loop can remain as it is because it ensures the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `dp` is updated such that for each `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1, `dp[j]` is the sum of the original `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, all taken modulo `MOD`.**
