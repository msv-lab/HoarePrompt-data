def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, and the loop executes as long as the original value of `b` is positive.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0 and the loop does not execute since `b` is not positive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is initially 0, the function will immediately return `a` as the GCD. The function correctly handles all cases, including when one or both integers are zero, but it assumes that `a` and `b` are positive integers as per the initial state.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `res` is the maximum value among `func_1(0, 1)`, `func_1(res, 2)`, ..., `func_1(res, n)`; `i` is `n`.
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the maximum value among func_1(0, 1), func_1(res, 2), ..., func_1(res, n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes the maximum value from a sequence of calls to `func_1`, starting with `func_1(0, 1)` and subsequently passing the maximum value computed so far (`res`) along with the current index `i` for each value from 2 to `n`. It returns this maximum value after evaluating all calls.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is a non-negative integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations of integers from 1 to n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):

            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is `n`; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` is the sum of all original `dp[k]` for `k` from 0 to `f_max_n` modulo `MOD`, and for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of original `dp[j]` and original `dp[j - 1]`, all taken modulo `MOD`.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns dp[f_max_n], which is the sum of all original dp[k] for k from 0 to f_max_n modulo MOD, where f_max_n is greater than or equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a non-negative integer `f_max_n` (where f_max_n must be greater than or equal to 1), and returns the value of `dp[f_max_n]`, which represents the number of ways to select `f_max_n` items from `n` distinct items, calculated using dynamic programming and taken modulo 10^9 + 7. It does not handle the case when `f_max_n` is less than 1 correctly, as the code assumes f_max_n is at least 1.
