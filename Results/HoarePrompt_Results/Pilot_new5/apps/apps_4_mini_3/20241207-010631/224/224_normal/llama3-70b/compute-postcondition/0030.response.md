The code updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 1`, we can express `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` in terms of `f_max_n`. Thus, `dp[j]` becomes `dp[f_max_n - 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` becomes `dp[f_max_n - 2]`. 

The variable `dp[j]` is updated based on the current values in the `dp` array, but the exact values of `dp[f_max_n]`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]`, and `dp[f_max_n - 2]` are not specified.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[j]` is now the sum of its previous value and the value of `dp[j - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, and `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`**.
