The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` by taking the modulus of the current value of `dp[j]` with respect to `MOD`. The variable `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 1`, and since `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, it follows that `j` is at least 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is updated to be `dp[j] % MOD`.**
