The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given the initial state, `j` is computed as `f_max_n - 2`, and since `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` will be at least 0.

The value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]`. The previous state of `dp[j]` is now affected. The states of other variables remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, and `dp[j]` is further updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
