The code updates `dp[j]` to be `dp[j] % MOD`. `dp[j]` is modified, while all other variables remain unchanged. Since `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is now equal to `dp[j] % MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
