The value of `MOD` is assigned the value of \(10^9 + 7\), which is a constant commonly used in programming to prevent integer overflow in calculations involving large numbers. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations of integers from 1 to n; `MOD` is 1000000007**
