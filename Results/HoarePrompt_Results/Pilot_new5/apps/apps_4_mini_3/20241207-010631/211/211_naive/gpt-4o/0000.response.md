To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the provided problem description, I will analyze the logic of the function and consider edge cases.

The program receives an integer `n` followed by a list `A` of `n` integers. It needs to determine if it is possible to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is not zero.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Total Sum Check**:
   - The program first calculates the total sum of the array `A`. If the total sum is not zero, it prints a single subarray that encompasses the entire array (from index 1 to n), which is valid because it would not equal zero.

2. **Non-Zero Element Check**:
   - If the total sum is zero, the program iterates through the array to find any non-zero element. If it finds one, it splits the array into two parts: from the start to the index of the non-zero element, and from the next index to the end of the array. This ensures that at least one of the parts will have a non-zero sum.

3. **Output Structure**:
   - If the entire array consists of zeros, the program correctly prints "NO".

### Potential Cases to Consider:

1. **Single Element Non-Zero**:
   - If the input array is `[1]`, the total sum is 1, which results in output:
     ```
     YES
     1
     1 1
     ```
   - This is correct because the single element is not zero.

2. **Total Sum Equals Zero with Two Non-Zero Elements**:
   - Input: `[2, -2]`
   - The total sum is zero, but both elements are non-zero. The program will output:
     ```
     YES
     2
     1 1
     2 2
     ```

3. **All Zeros**:
   - Input: `[0, 0, 0]`
   - The program will output:
     ```
     NO
     ```
   - This is correct because it is impossible to create non-zero subarrays.

4. **Zero and Non-Zero Mix**:
   - Input: `[0, 1, -1]`
   - The total sum is zero, but there are non-zero elements. The program will output:
     ```
     YES
     2
     1 1
     2 3
     ```
   - This is valid because the first subarray has a non-zero sum.

5. **An Edge Case with Multiple Zeros**:
   - Input: `[0, 0, 3]`
   - The total sum is 3, so it will output:
     ```
     YES
     1
     1 3
     ```
   - This is correct since the entire array sum is non-zero.

### Conclusion:
Upon evaluating several potential edge cases and the logic of the given program, it meets the requirements of the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
