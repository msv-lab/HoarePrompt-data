Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that is greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, and `i` is 2. If `A[2]` is not equal to 0, the printed output is '4 n' where n is the value of `n`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
