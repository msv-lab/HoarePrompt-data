The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `l`, `r`, and `prefix_sum` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is between 1 and 100, the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0, `k` is now 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`; 1 1 1 is printed to output.
