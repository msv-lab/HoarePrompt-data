The variable `l` is assigned the value of `r`. The previous value of `r` is 3, so now `l` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is between 1 and 100, and the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0; `k` is 4; `l` is now 3; `r` is still 3.

Output State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is between 1 and 100, and the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0; `k` is 4; `l` is 3; `r` is 3.**
