The code `print(k, l, r)` outputs the current values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. Since `k` is updated to 3, `l` is updated to 2, and `r` is 3, those are the values that will be printed. Other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is between 1 and 100, and the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0; `k` is 3, `l` is 2, `r` is 3**
