The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. This does not change any variable values or states, but it indicates that a message has been printed. The preconditions regarding `n`, `A`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged, only the output message is produced.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^3 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^3, `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`, the current value of `total_sum` is not equal to 0, and the output is 'YES'.**
