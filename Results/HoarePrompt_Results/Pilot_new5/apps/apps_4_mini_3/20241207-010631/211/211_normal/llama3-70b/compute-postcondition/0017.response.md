Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is between 1 and 100, the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 1. The current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.***
