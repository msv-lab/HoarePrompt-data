The code simply prints 'YES'. Since variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged, the output state reflects the unchanged conditions along with the fact that the string 'YES' was printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `A` (A[0]) is not 0. 'YES' has been printed.**
