The code initializes `prefix_sum` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The previous state of `n` allows for it to be an integer between 1 and 100, meaning that `prefix_sum` will have a length ranging from 2 to 101 (inclusive). Therefore, the values of `prefix_sum` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of n integers derived from input; `prefix_sum` is a list of length n + 1 containing all zeros.**
