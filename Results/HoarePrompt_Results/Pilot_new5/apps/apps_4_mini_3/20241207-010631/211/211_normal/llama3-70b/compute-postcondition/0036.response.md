Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `A` of `n` integers (each between -1000 and 1000). It calculates the prefix sum of `A` and checks if the total sum of `A` is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. If the sum is not zero, it prints 'YES' and identifies and prints sequences of indices where the prefix sum is neither zero nor equal to the total sum, followed by the indices `k`, `l`, and `n`. The function does not return any values but outputs the results directly.**
