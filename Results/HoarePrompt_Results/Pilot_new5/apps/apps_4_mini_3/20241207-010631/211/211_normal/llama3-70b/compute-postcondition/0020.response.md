The variable `l` is assigned the value of `r`. Given that `r` is currently 1, this means `l` will also become 1. The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided conditions. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `l` while retaining the relevant information about the other variables.

Output State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is between 1 and 100, the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0, `k` is 2, `l` is 1 (remains unchanged), `r` is 1 (remains unchanged), the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`; 1 1 1 is printed to output.**
