To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, let's analyze the program step by step with respect to the requirements.

### Requirements from the Problem Description
1. The program must read an integer `n` (the number of elements in the array) and then read the array `A` of `n` integers.
2. It should check if it's possible to split the array `A` into several parts such that the sum of each part is not zero.
3. If it's possible, the program should print "YES", the number of parts `k`, and the indices that define each part.
4. If it's not possible, it should print "NO".

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the subsequent list of integers `A`. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates a `prefix_sum` array that contains cumulative sums of the elements of `A`. This is a good approach to determine the sum of any subarray.

3. **Zero Sum Check**: The program checks if the total sum (i.e., `prefix_sum[n]`) is zero. If it is, it correctly prints "NO". This satisfies the problem requirement of needing non-zero sums for all parts.

4. **Splitting Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the `prefix_sum` array, checking each prefix sum to see if it's non-zero and not equal to the total sum. 
   - If it finds such a prefix sum, it attempts to define parts by adjusting the indices `l` and `r`. 
   - However, it does not handle the case where there may be multiple non-zero subarrays that contribute to the total sum being non-zero but still allow for valid partitions.

5. **Final Part Inclusion**: At the end of the loop, the program correctly includes the last segment from the last valid `l` to `n`, which ensures that every part from the start to the end of `A` is accounted for.

### Potential Issues
- The program fails to ensure that every part formed indeed has a non-zero sum. Specifically, it can print segments that may themselves sum to zero by just skipping over the segments where the total sum is achieved through a combination of positive and negative numbers that result in zero. For example, if `A` contains segments that cancel each other out within the valid indices, those segments would still be included in the output.

### Conclusion
Based on the above analysis, the program does not always meet the requirements of the problem description. It may produce outputs that include segments where the sum is zero, which is a violation of the problem requirements.

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
