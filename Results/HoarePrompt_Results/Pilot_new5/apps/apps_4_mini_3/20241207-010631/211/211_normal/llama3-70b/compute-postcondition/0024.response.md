The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is between 1 and 100, the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0, `k` is 3, `l` is 1, `r` is 2; the values 2, 1, and 2 have been printed.
