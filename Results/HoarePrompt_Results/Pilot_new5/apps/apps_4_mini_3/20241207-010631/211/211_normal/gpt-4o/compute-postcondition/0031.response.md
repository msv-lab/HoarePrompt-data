Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^3 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^3, and `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, the output is '1' followed by the value of `n`. If `total_sum` is equal to 0 and at least one element of `A` is not 0, 'YES' is printed followed by '2', '1', and the index of the non-zero element plus one, along with the range from the next index to `n`. If all elements of `A` are 0, 'NO' is printed.***
