The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 1, "YES" has been printed, '2' has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
