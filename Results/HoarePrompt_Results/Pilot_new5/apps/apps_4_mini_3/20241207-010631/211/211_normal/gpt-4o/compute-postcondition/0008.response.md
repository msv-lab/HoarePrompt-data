To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over `n`, which is defined as an input integer satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). This means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to run. 
2. The variable `i` will take on values from 0 to \(n - 1\), hence it will start at 0 during the first iteration.
3. The total sum being equal to 0 does not affect the execution of the loop; it only matters for the computation within the loop body.

Given that `n` is an integer satisfying the constraints, and that `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in the list `A`, if `total_sum` equals 0, it implies that the input list `A` must contain specific combinations of integers (e.g., equal numbers of positive and negative numbers).

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already satisfied since \(1 \leq n\)).
- Initially, `i` should be set to 0, which is the starting index for the loop.

The state before the loop execution can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 0**.
