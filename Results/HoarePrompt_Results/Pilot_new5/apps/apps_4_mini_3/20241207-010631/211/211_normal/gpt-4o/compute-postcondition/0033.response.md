Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `A`. If the sum of the integers in `A` is not zero, it prints 'YES', '1', and '1 n'. If the sum is zero and there is at least one non-zero element in `A`, it prints 'YES', '2', '1', and the index of the first non-zero element plus one, followed by the range from the next index to `n'. If all elements of `A` are zero, it prints 'NO'. **
