The code snippet prints the sum of `i` and 2 along with the value of `n`. The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 2` equals 4. The value of `n` is an integer greater than 2 (between 3 and 100). The print operation does not affect the state of the variables, but it produces output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 2, printed output is '4 n' where n is the value of n.**
