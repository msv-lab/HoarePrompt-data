To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze its logic according to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the maximum possible value of the mex (minimum excluded value) of an array after potentially decreasing the values of its elements. The mex of an array is defined as the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The given program does the following:
1. Reads an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers.
2. Sorts the array.
3. Initializes a `mex` variable to 1.
4. Iterates through the sorted array:
   - If the current number matches `mex`, it increments `mex`.
   - If the current number is greater than `mex`, it breaks the loop.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `mex`.

### Potential Missing Logic:
The logic assumes that by sorting the array and checking against the current value of `mex`, we can determine the maximum mex possible. However, it does not account for the fact that there may be gaps in the values that could be created by decreasing larger numbers. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this scenario, the program will result in `mex = 6` correctly. However, if we provide an input where we can manipulate the elements, such as:
```
5
1 1 1 1 10
```
The program will also yield a mex of `2`, indicating it assumes that once we hit a number larger than `mex`, we can simply stop checking. 

However, it fails to consider that even though we have the number `10`, we can lower it (and any `1`s) to achieve `1, 2, 3, ..., 6`, which should mean it essentially can reach `mex = 7`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not account for potential cases where elements can be decreased to fill gaps, there exist inputs where it will not compute the correct maximum mex value.

Correctness: **False**. 

A counterexample is the input `5` and array `1 1 1 1 10`, where the maximum mex could be `7` after appropriate adjustments, but the program will output `2`.
