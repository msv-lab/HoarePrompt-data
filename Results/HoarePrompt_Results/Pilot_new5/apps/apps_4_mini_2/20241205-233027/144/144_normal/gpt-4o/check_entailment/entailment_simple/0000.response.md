To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements of the problem and the behavior of the program.

### Problem Description Summary:
- Alyona has an array of positive integers.
- She can decrease any element to any positive integer less than its current value.
- The goal is to find the maximum possible value of the `mex` (minimum excluded value) of the array after performing any number of operations.
- The `mex` of an array is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the array.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads an integer `n` (the number of elements) and an array `a` of length `n`.
2. It sorts the array `a`.
3. It initializes `mex` to 1.
4. It iterates over the sorted array `a`:
   - If the current number is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `mex`.

### Verification of Correctness:
- The program sorts the array, which allows it to process the numbers in increasing order.
- As it checks each number in the sorted array, it correctly updates the `mex` value:
  - If the current number `num` is at least `mex`, it means `mex` can potentially be included in the resulting array (because Alyona can decrease other numbers to reach `mex`).
- If the number is less than `mex`, it doesnâ€™t matter for the calculation of `mex` since those numbers cannot help to achieve a higher `mex`.
- The final value of `mex` after processing all numbers will effectively represent the largest possible `mex` that could be achieved given the ability to change numbers in the array.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to find the maximum possible `mex` for the array according to the problem description. It considers all possible operations Alyona can perform and computes the result based on the possible values that can be represented in the final array.

Thus, the correctness of the program is established:

Correctness: **True**
