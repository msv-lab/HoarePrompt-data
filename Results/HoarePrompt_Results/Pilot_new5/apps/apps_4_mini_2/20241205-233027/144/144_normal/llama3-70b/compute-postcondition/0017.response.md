According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the `arr` list. At the end of the last iteration, we have `num` being the current integer from `arr`, which is the next element to process in the loop.

Since `arr` is a non-empty sorted list with at least one more element than `num`, after the current iteration, there will be another integer in the `arr` list to process in the next iteration. Therefore, `num` will take on the value of the next integer in the list.

Considering that `num` will change to this next integer and there is still an element in `arr`, the state at the start of the next iteration will reflect the conditions around `mex`. 

To summarize:
- `num` will be updated to the next integer in the `arr` list.
- The state of `mex` may or may not change depending on the new value of `num`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element than the current `num`, `num` is the next integer in `arr`, `mex` is unchanged or incremented by 1 if `num` is equal to the previous `mex`**
