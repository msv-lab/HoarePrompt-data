The `arr` list is sorted in ascending order. The variable `n` maintains its value as a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, and `a` also retains its previous state as a list of `n` positive integers. The only variable that is directly affected is `arr`, which now contains its elements in sorted order.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a sorted list of integers.**
