`a` is assigned a sorted version of itself, which means its elements will be arranged in non-decreasing order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the elements of `a` will now reflect their sorted order. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer that is now equal to the integer input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is now equal to the integer input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order.**
