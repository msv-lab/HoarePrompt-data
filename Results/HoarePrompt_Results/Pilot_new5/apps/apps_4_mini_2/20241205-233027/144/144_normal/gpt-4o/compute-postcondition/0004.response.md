According to the code, the for loop will iterate over the list `a`, which contains `n` positive integers. Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, it implies that there is at least one element in the list `a`. 

Since `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and `mex` starts at 1, the loop can execute, iterating over each element in `a`. At the start of the loop, the first element that `num` will take is `a[0]`, and the index of the loop iteration will be 0. Therefore, the states to be adjusted are related to the loop variable `num` and its index.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is the first element in `a`, and the index for the loop is 0**
