The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function to each element of the input split into separate strings. The input will provide `n` integers that adhere to the constraints given in the initial state. Thus, `a` will now be a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9`. The value of `n` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is now equal to the integer input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9, assigned from the input.**
