The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The variable `mex` can either remain unchanged or increase by 1 depending on whether `num` is equal to the previous value of `mex`. However, since `mex` is explicitly incremented by 1 in the code, it will definitely increase. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element than the current `num`; `num` is the next integer in `arr`; `mex` is the previous `mex` incremented by 1.
