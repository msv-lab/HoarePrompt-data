Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers; if `num` is equal to `mex` (which is 2), then `mex` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mex` remains 1, and if `num` is greater than `mex`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
