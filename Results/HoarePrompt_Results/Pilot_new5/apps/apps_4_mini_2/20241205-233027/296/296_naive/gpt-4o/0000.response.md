To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) such that:
1. \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \).
2. \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \).
3. The sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

### Code Analysis:
1. The code begins by checking if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2, returning 'NO' if true. This correctly handles the case for the smallest input \( n = 2 \).
2. It then computes the divisors of \( n \) in the range from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} \).
3. If no divisors are found, it returns 'NO'.
4. If divisors are found, it constructs fractions of the form \( \frac{1}{d} \) where \( d \) is a divisor.
5. It returns 'YES', the count of the fractions, and the fractions themselves.

### Potential Issues:
- The calculation of fractions \( \frac{1}{d} \) will only work correctly if the sum of these fractions can actually equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \) for the given divisors.
- The code does not check if the sum of the fractions \( \frac{1}{d} \) generated actually equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \) before returning the result.
- Certain values of \( n \), especially prime numbers greater than 2, will yield no valid divisors satisfying the conditions, and hence the function should return 'NO'. However, for composite numbers, the fractions may not sum correctly.

### Case to Consider:
For \( n = 3 \):
- The divisors found will be empty since 3 is prime, hence it will return 'NO' which is correct.
  
For \( n = 4 \):
- The divisors are 2. The fraction \( \frac{1}{2} \) is generated. However, \( \frac{1}{2} \) does not equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \).
  
For \( n = 5 \):
- The divisors will again be empty, returning 'NO', which is correct.

For \( n = 6 \):
- The divisors are 2 and 3. Here, the program constructs the fractions \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \). The sum is \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \) which equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \), which works correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle composite numbers correctly when their divisors generate fractions that do not sum to \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). Therefore, the existence of such a case where the output does not satisfy the requirement indicates that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
