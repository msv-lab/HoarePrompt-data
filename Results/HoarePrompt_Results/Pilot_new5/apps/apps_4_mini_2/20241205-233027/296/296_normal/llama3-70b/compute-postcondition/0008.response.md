The `print` statement outputs the string '1' followed by the current value of `n`. The value of `k` is unaffected by this operation. The output does not modify any variable values but simply prints them.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and n is not equal to 2; `k` is 2; the value 2 has been printed; '1' and the result of `n` have been printed.**
