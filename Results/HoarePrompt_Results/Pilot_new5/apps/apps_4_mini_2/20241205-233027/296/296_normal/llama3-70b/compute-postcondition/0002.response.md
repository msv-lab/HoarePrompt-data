The code executes a print statement which outputs the string 'NO'. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and the current value of `n` is still 2; and 'NO' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and the current value of `n` is 2; 'NO' has been printed.**
