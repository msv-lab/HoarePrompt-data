The code snippet `divisors.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer greater than 4 and up to \(10^9\), and that `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. Since there are no conditions affecting the value of `i` regarding whether it is already included in `divisors`, we can assume that `divisors` is a list, and now it will include the value of `i`.

Given that `i` is based on `n`, where \(i = \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\), and with `n` being a positive integer greater than 4, the resulting value for `i` will also be a positive integer. 

Other variables such as `n` and `divisors` remain unchanged in terms of their propertiesâ€”`n` remains a positive integer within the specified bounds, and the list `divisors` will now contain the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 4; `i` is int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1; `divisors` includes the previous values and now also includes the value `i`.**
