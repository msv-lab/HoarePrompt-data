The value of `n` is a positive integer between 5 and 10^9. `i` is 3. The `divisors` list includes the value 3. The code appends `n // i` to the `divisors` list. 

Since `i` is 3, `n // i` will yield the integer division of `n` by 3. The value of `n // i` will be at least 1 (when n is 5) and can be as high as 333333333 (when n is 10^9).

Thus, the `divisors` list will now include the new value `n // 3`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 3; `divisors` now includes the value 3 and `n // 3`.**
