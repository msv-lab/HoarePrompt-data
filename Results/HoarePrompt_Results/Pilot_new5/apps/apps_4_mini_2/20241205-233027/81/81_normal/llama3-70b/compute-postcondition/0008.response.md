The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. After executing the function body, if `b` is 0, the function returns `a`, which is the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the GCD of `a` and `b` when `b` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers, a and b, and returns a, which is the GCD of a and b when b is 0.**
