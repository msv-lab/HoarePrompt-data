Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9), `r` is an integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `z` is equal to `y // x` where `z` is greater than or equal to 1, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `z * x`, and the current values of `a` and `b` satisfy `l <= a <= r`, `l <= b <= r`, `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`.***
