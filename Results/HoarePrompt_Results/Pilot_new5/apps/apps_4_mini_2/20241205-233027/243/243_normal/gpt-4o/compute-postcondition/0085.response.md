Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains the integers between the last valid `left + 1` and `right - 1`, based on the initial value of `m`, where `zeroes` equals `m`. If the loop did not execute, then `result` remains an empty list and `low` is still 0 while `high` is 5 * (initial `m` + 1).**
