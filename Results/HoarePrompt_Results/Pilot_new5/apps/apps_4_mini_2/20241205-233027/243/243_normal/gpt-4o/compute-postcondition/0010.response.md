The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` is `(5 * m + 5) // 2`, and now `high` will be adjusted accordingly. The previous valid conditions for other variables remain unchanged, specifically that `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`, `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, and the current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to `(5 * m + 5) // 2 - 1`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`; the current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`.**
