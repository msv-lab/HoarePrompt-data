The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is decreased by 1.
