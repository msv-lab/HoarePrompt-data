The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and this value is reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `left` while maintaining the conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - 1; and `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.**
