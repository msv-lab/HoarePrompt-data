The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was such that `func_1(left - 1)` equals `m`, which implies that `left` was initially `func_1(left - 1) + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so they retain their previous conditions.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is an empty list; `left` is adjusted to `left - 1`.**
