Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is incremented to `right + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, and `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`.**
