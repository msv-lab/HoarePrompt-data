The code initializes `result` as an empty list. The values of `m`, `zeroes`, and `mid` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `result` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `result` is an empty list**.
