`mid` is assigned the value of the expression `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), the value of `high` can be expressed as \(5m + 5\). Therefore, `mid` becomes \((0 + (5m + 5)) // 2\), simplifying to \((5m + 5) // 2\).

The states of the other variables `m`, `low`, `high`, and `result` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5m + 5) // 2.**
