The code assigns the value of `result` as a list of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. Since `left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, and `right` has been incremented to `right + k`, the updated `right` will determine the range of the list. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `right` is incremented to `right + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, and `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`.**
