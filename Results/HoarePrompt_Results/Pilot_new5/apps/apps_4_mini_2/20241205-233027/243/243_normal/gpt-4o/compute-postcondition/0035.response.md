The value of `zeroes` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(mid)`. The variable `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which is not directly stated in the initial state but implies that `low` and `high` are defined and `mid` is valid within that range. The constraints on `m` indicate that `zeroes` can be less than `m`, but we don't have specific values for `zeroes` after the function call. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `m`, `low`, and `high`, along with the newly assigned value of `zeroes`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
