The code snippet prints the elements of the list `ans`, which contains the values [1, 2, 3, 4]. The `print` function formats these values as a string separated by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, and the length of `ans` are not affected by the printing operation. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is 5 if `m` is 1, `ans` contains [1, 2, 3, 4], length of `ans` is 4**
