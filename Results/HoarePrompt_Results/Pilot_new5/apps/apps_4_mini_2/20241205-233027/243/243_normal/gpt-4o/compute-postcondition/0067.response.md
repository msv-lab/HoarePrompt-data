`left` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `mid - 1`.
