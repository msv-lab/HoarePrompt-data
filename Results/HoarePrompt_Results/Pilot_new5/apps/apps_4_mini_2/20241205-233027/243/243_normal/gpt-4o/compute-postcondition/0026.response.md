To determine what needs to be adjusted for the `while func_1(right) == m:` loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop can continue.

1. The loop will execute as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. 
2. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is defined as `(5 * m + 5) // 2 + 3`.
3. The state mentions that `zeroes` must be adjusted to ensure `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

Given that `func_1(right)` currently equals `m`, we need to ensure that this condition remains true for the next iteration. If `zeroes` is a parameter of `func_1` that may influence its outcome, we need to adjust `zeroes` to maintain the relationship.

Since `zeroes` must be adjusted but we don't have the exact initial condition or impact of `zeroes`, we can't specify its value. However, we know it must be modified such that `func_1(right)` continues to yield `m`.

Thus, the essential modification is related to `zeroes`, ensuring that it contributes correctly to `func_1(right)`.

State: **`left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 - `k`, `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` must be adjusted to ensure func_1(right) remains equal to m, `right` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 + 3**
