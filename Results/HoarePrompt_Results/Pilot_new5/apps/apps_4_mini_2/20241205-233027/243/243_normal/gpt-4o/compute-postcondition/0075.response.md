The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `right` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is incremented by 1.**
