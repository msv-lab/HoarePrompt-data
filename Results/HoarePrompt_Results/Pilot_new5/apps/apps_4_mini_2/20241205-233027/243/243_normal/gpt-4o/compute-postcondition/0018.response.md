According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(left) == m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must equal `m` at the end of the last iteration. As stated, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`, so the state remains valid and doesn't require any adjustments to continue looping.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 - 2; and `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.**
