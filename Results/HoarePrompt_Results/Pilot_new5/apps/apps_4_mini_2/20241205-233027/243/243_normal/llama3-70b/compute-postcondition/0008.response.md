According to the code, since the loop condition is `while True`, the loop will always execute again regardless of the state variables. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 0; `n` is 1; `count` remains 0 after execution.**
