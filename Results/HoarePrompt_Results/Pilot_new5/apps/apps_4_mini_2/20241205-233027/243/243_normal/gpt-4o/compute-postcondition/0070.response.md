According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the function `func_1(left)` and its relationship to `m`. For the loop to continue executing, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `left` has been decreased by 1. Therefore, to ensure that `func_1(left)` still equals `m`, we need to verify that `left` must be adjusted such that `func_1(left)` will return `m` after it has been decreased.

Since `left` was decreased by 1, we can conclude that `left` should now be adjusted back to its previous value (which we'll call `left + 1`) to potentially satisfy the condition of `func_1(left)` equaling `m`. 

No other states need to be adjusted based on the information provided. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` must be equal to its previous value (which is `left + 1`)**
