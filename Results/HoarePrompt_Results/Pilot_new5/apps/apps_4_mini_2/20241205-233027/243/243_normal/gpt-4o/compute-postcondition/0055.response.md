The variable `result` is assigned a list created by the `range` function, which generates a list of integers starting from `left + 1` up to `right - 1`. The value of `left` is known, as it is the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` minus 1. The variable `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`. As `left` is less than `right`, `result` will contain the integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `left` is the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` minus 1, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`.**
