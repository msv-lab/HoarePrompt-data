The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is not specified, but the condition that `func_1(left)` still equals `m` must still hold after the adjustment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `left` while keeping other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is an empty list; `left` is adjusted to `left - 1` such that `func_1(left)` still equals `m`.**
