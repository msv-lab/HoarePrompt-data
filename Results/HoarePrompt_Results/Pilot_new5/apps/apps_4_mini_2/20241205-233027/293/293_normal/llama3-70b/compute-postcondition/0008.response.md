The value of `n` is halved using floor division, meaning that `n` is assigned the value of `n // 2`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 1, which means that `n` will be reduced but will still remain greater than or equal to 1. The other variables, `h` and `ans`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `n` is assigned the value `n // 2`.**
