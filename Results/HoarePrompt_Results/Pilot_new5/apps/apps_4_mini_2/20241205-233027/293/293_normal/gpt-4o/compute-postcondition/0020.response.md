The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` was 4, so after the increment, it becomes 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 5, `path` is a binary representation of `n - 1` padded to a length of `h`, `current_level` is 1.
