The function `func` accepts two parameters: `h` and `n`. The parameter `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), and the parameter `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\). The function does not have an explicit output value described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `h` and an integer `n`, while ensuring that `h` is within the specified range and `n` does not exceed \(2^h\).

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `h` (1 ≤ h ≤ 50) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h).**
