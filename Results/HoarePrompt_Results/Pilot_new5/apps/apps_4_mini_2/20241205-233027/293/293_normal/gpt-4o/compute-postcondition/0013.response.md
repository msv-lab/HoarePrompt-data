Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary representation of `n - 1` padded to a length of `h`, `current_level` is 0, if `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is updated to 1. Otherwise, if `direction` is not '0', then `current_node` is updated to 2.***
