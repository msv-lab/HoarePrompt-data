The variables `h` and `n` are assigned new values from the input. The `input` function reads a string from standard input, which is then split into two parts and converted to integers using `map`. The conditions state that `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h. 

Thus, after executing the code, the values of `h` and `n` will be updated according to the values obtained from the input. The states of the other variables (if any) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h**.
