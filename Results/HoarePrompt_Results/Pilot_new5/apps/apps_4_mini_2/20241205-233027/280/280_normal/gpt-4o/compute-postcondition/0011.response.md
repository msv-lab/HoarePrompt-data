The loop updates the `speeds` list based on the values of `v1`, `v2`, `d`, and the previous speeds. After completing all iterations, each speed at index `i` will be updated to the minimum of the previous speed plus `d` and a calculated maximum speed considering the remaining time `t - i - 1`.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = t - 1`, the final state will include the updated values of `speeds` for all indices from `1` to `t - 2`, as well as maintaining the initial values for `speeds[0]` and `speeds[-1]`. 

For the output state after all iterations have completed, we can summarize:

- `v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100)
- `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100)
- `t` must be at least 2 (for the loop to execute)
- `d` is an integer updated from input
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` where:
  - `speeds[0]` is equal to `v1`
  - `speeds[i]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ t - 2` is equal to min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
  - `speeds[-1]` is equal to `v2`

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100), `t` is an integer (t ≥ 2), `d` is an integer updated from input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where `speeds[0]` is equal to `v1`, `speeds[1]` is equal to min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d), `speeds[2]` is equal to min(speeds[1] + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d), ..., `speeds[t - 2]` is equal to min(speeds[t - 3] + d, v2 + (t - 4) * d), and `speeds[-1]` is equal to `v2.`**
