To determine the output state after the execution of the provided code, we start by understanding the initial state of the relevant variables:

- `v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100)
- `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100)
- `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100)
- `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10)
- `max_speed` is now `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`
- `min_speed` is `min(min(v_1, v_2) + d, max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2)))`
- `max_length` is `max(v_1, v_2) * t + max_speed`
- `min_length` is `min(v_1, v_2) * t + min_speed`
- `i` is `t - 2`

Now, the code `min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)` updates `min_speed` with the value of `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.

1. **Calculate `min_speed + d`:**
   - This expression increases the current `min_speed` by `d`.

2. **Find `max_speed`:**
   - `max_speed` is already defined as `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` and is unaffected by the code snippet.

3. **Compare `min_speed + d` with `max_speed`:**
   - The new value of `min_speed` will be the smaller value between `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

Now, we summarize the changes and maintain the preconditions:

- The value of `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of its previous value incremented by `d` and `max_speed`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is now `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max(v_1, v_2) * t + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min(v_1, v_2) * t + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 2`.**
