The code `min_length += min_speed` increments the value of `min_length` by the current value of `min_speed`. The previous values of the variables remain intact, and only `min_length` is updated. The output state will reflect the new value of `min_length` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Since `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, we can summarize the output state as follows: 

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (3 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is now `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is now `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is now `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is now `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3, min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`.**
