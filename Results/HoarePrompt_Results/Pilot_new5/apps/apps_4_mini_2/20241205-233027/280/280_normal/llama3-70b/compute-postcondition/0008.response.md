To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we can follow these steps:

1. From the initial state, we have the following variables:
   - `v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100)
   - `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100)
   - `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100)
   - `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10)
   - `max_speed` is updated to `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`
   - `min_speed` is `min(v_1, v_2)`
   - `max_length` is `max(v_1, v_2) * t`
   - `min_length` is `min(v_1, v_2) * t`
   - `i` is `t - 1`

2. After evaluating the assignments:
   - We have `min_speed` initially set to `min(v_1, v_2)`.
   - `max_speed` is calculated based on the values of `v_1`, `v_2`, and `d`.

3. The line of code executed is:
   ```
   min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
   ```

4. The impact of this code:
   - `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of its current value (which is `min(v_1, v_2)`) plus `d` and `max_speed`.
   - Therefore, `min_speed` is now `min(min(v_1, v_2) + d, max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2)))`.

5. The other variables remain unchanged.

Combining these insights, we summarize the output state:

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is `max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2))`, `min_speed` is `min(min(v_1, v_2) + d, max(max(v_1, v_2) - d, min(v_1, v_2)))`, `max_length` is `max(v_1, v_2) * t`, `min_length` is `min(v_1, v_2) * t`, `i` is `t - 1`.**
