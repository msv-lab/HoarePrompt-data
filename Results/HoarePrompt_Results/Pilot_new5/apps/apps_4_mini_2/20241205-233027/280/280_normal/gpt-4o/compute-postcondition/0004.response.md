The code assigns the value of `v2` to the last element of the `speeds` list, which is `speeds[-1]`. The length of the `speeds` list is `t`, and the first element is `v1`, while all other elements are initialized to zero. After executing the code, the last element of the list will be updated to `v2`, therefore changing the last value in the list while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100), `t` is an integer updated from input, `d` is an integer updated from input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where speeds[0] is equal to `v1` and speeds[-1] is equal to `v2`, and all other speeds[i] for i in range(1, t-1) are zeros.**
