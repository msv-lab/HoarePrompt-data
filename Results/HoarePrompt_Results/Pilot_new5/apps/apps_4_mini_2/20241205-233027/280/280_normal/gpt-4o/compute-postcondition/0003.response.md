The value of `speeds[0]` is assigned the value of `v1`, which is an input integer ranging from 1 to 100. The list `speeds` was previously initialized to zeros, so after this assignment, the first element of the list `speeds` will hold the value of `v1`. The other values in the list remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), `t` is an integer updated from input, `d` is an integer updated from input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where speeds[0] is equal to `v1`, and the rest are zeros.**
