To calculate `total_distance`, we first need to understand the values stored in `speeds`. The list `speeds` is built based on the initial values of `v1`, `v2`, `d`, and `t`. 

Given that:
- `speeds[0]` is equal to `v1`
- `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`
- Each subsequent `speeds[i]` for `2 <= i < t - 1` is equal to `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - 2 - i) * d)`
- `speeds[t - 1]` is equal to `v2`

After calculating all the values of `speeds`, we sum them up to get `total_distance`.

The value of `total_distance` will be the sum of all elements in the `speeds` list.

The initial variables `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` remain unchanged, but `total_distance` is now calculated.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100), `t` is an integer (t ≥ 2), `d` is an integer updated from input, `speeds` is a list of length `t`, and `total_distance` is equal to the sum of the elements in `speeds`.**
