The value of `i` is incremented by 6. The previous value of `i` was 11, so now `i` becomes 17. The states of the other variables (`n` and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` is greater than or equal to 121; `i` is 17.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` is greater than or equal to 121; `i` is 17**
