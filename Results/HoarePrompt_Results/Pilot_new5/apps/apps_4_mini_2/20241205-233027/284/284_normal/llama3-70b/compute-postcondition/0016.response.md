The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer parameter `num` that must lie within the range of 1 to 1000. It checks whether the number is a prime number. According to its logic:

1. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`.
2. It then checks divisibility of `num` by all integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not prime.
3. If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number.

However, the annotations imply that the function should explicitly return `False` for even numbers. While it does return `False` for all even numbers greater than 2 through the loop check, this explicit check is not in the code. 

The function also does not make any distinction for specific cases where `num` could be 1 or 2, although it correctly handles them according to prime number definitions.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if it is not a prime number; it returns `True` if `num` is a prime number between 1 and 1000. It does not explicitly check for even numbers except for the case where `num` is 2. **
