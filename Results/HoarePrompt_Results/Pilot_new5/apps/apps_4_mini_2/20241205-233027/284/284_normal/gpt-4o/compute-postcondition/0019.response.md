According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will continue as long as \( i^2 \) is less than or equal to \( x \). At the end of the last iteration, \( i \) is 17, meaning \( i^2 \) is \( 289 \). Since \( x \) is greater than or equal to \( 121 \), we need to ensure that \( x \) is at least \( 289 \) for the loop to execute one more time, as \( i \) will not change during the loop.

Given that \( n \) is a positive integer between \( 1 \) and \( 1000 \) and does not affect \( i \) or \( x \) directly, it does not need to be adjusted for this loop to run again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust \( x \) to be at least \( 289 \).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` must be at least 289; `i` is 17**
