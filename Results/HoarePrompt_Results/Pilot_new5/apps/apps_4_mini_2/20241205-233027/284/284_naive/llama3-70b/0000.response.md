To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to ensure that the program correctly finds a positive integer `m` such that the expression `n * m + 1` results in a non-prime number for the input `n`.

Let's break down the program:

1. The program reads an integer `n`.
2. It iterates over values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. For each value of `m`, it computes `n * m + 1` and checks if this result is **not** a prime number using the `func_1` function.
4. The `func_1` function determines primality by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.

Now, we need to consider if there are any cases where this implementation might not work correctly.

### Potential Cases to Check

1. **Understanding the primality test**: The `func_1` function will return `False` for non-prime numbers such as 4, 6, 8, etc. This means that for such cases, the program should be able to find a corresponding `m`.

2. **Values of `n`**: For every positive integer `n` from 1 to 1000, we need to see if there exists an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is non-prime. 

3. **Guarantees**: The problem states that it is guaranteed that a suitable `m` always exists for the given `n`.

### Example to Consider

- For `n = 1`, if we compute:
  - For `m = 1`: `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime)
  - For `m = 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (prime)
  - For `m = 3`: `1 * 3 + 1 = 4` (not prime) — the program should output `3`.

- For `n = 2`:
  - For `m = 1`: `2 * 1 + 1 = 3` (prime)
  - For `m = 2`: `2 * 2 + 1 = 5` (prime)
  - For `m = 3`: `2 * 3 + 1 = 7` (prime)
  - For `m = 4`: `2 * 4 + 1 = 9` (not prime) — the program should output `4`.

Following through various scenarios shows that there will always exist an `m` resulting in a non-prime value due to the guaranteed existence mentioned in the problem description.

### Conclusion

After examining the logic, the loop structure, and the primality test, I conclude that there are no cases where it fails to produce a suitable `m`. The program properly adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
