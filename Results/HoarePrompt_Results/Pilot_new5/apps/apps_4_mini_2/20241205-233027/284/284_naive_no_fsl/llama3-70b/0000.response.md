To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze it based on the problem description, requirements, and how it handles various inputs.

### Problem Requirements:
The task is to find a positive integer `m` such that the expression `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for a given positive integer `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`). The output should be any such `m` that lies within the range `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000`.

### Program Logic:
1. The program reads an integer `n`.
2. It iterates through possible values of `m` from `1` to `1000`.
3. For each value of `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if this number is prime using the `func_1` function.
4. If `n * m + 1` is found to be not prime, it prints `m` and breaks the loop.

### The Prime Checking Function:
The `func_1` function determines if a number is prime. It returns `False` if the number is less than `2` or has divisors other than `1` and itself (by checking divisibility from `2` to the square root of the number).

### Potential Issue:
- The core logic appears to be sound; however, we should check if there are cases where the program might fail to find an `m` within the specified range that satisfies the condition.

Let's consider a case where `n = 1`:
- For `m = 1`: `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (which is prime)
- For `m = 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (which is prime)
- For `m = 3`: `1 * 3 + 1 = 4` (which is not prime)

Here, the program would output `3`, which is correct. 

Now let's evaluate a higher value of `n`, say `n = 2`:
- For `m = 1`: `2 * 1 + 1 = 3` (which is prime)
- For `m = 2`: `2 * 2 + 1 = 5` (which is prime)
- For `m = 3`: `2 * 3 + 1 = 7` (which is prime)
- For `m = 4`: `2 * 4 + 1 = 9` (which is not prime)

In this case, the program would output `4`, which is also correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The program iterates through all values of `m` from `1` to `1000` and will eventually find a case where `n * m + 1` is not prime due to the nature of multiplication and addition involved, especially since the problem guarantees that an answer exists. 

Given that we have not identified any input case that fails the program analysis, we conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the logic to find an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime, as required by the problem statement.
