The value of `c` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `c` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `c` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary containing at least one key (a unique integer from `a`), `a1` is assigned the value of `i`, and `c` is increased by 1.**
