The code `a.append(int(input()))` appends an integer input to the list `a`. The current state indicates that `a` already contains one integer input, and `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, while `i` is 1. The specific value of the integer input added to the list `a` is unknown, as it depends on user input.

After executing the code, the updated state will reflect that `a` now contains two integers: the original integer and the new integer input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing two integers (the original integer and a new integer input).**
