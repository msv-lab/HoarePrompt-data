Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100) and then reads `n` integers from input (each between 1 and 100). It counts the frequency of each integer. If there are fewer than 2 unique integers, it prints 'NO'. If there are at least 2 unique integers, it checks if the two most common integers both appear exactly `n // 2` times. If so, it prints 'YES' followed by those two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If there are no integers or improper input is provided, the behavior is not explicitly defined in the code.**
