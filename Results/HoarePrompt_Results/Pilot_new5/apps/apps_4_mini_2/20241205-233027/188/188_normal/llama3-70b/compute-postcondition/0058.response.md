The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as its input is provided through standard input (stdin). It processes an even integer `n` between 2 and 100, which indicates the number of lines that follow, each containing an integer `a_i` where each `a_i` is constrained between 1 and 100. After executing the function body, the function likely performs some operations based on the values of `n` and `a_i` but does not explicitly state what it returns in the provided output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes an even integer n between 2 and 100 and n subsequent integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) provided via standard input.**
