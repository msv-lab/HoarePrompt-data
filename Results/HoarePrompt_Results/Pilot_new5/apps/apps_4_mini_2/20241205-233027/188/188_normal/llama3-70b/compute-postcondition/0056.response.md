The code executes a `print('NO')` statement, which outputs the string "NO" to the console. No variables are modified or assigned new values. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a1` is either -1 or refers to the first key in `d` such that `d[a1]` equals `n // 2`, `a2` is -1, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 indicating the count of unique integers in `a` that appeared exactly `n // 2` times, and `d` is a dictionary containing counts of each unique integer from `a`. The output "NO" has been printed.**
