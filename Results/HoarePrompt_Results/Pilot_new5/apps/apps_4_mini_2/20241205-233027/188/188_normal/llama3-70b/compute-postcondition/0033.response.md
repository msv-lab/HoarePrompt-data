The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is the first key in the dictionary `d`, and since `d` contains at least one key, `i` has a specific value. The variable `a2` will now hold the same value as `i`, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key (a unique integer from `a`), `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key (a unique integer from `a`), `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`.**
