Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first element of `a`, and `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user. If `i` is already in `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `d`, then `d[i]` is set to 1, and `i` is added to the collection `d`.***
