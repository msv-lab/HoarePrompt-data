Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary containing at least one key, and the state of `c` is preserved. If `d[i]` equals `n // 2` and if `c` is 0, then `c` is increased by 1 and `a1` is set to `i`. If `c` is not 0, then `c` remains unchanged, `a2` is set to `i`, and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.***
