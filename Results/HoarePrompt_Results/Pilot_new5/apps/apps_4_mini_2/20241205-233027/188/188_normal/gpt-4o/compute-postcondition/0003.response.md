The variable `unique_numbers` is assigned the sorted list of the keys from the `count` object, ordered by their corresponding frequency in `cards`. The state of `n`, `cards`, and `count` remains unaffected by this sorting operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new variable created.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` input integers; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the keys in `count` based on their frequency in `cards`.**
