To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic used in the code and see if it correctly handles all possible edge cases.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Input Handling:** 
   - The program reads an integer `n` (the number of cards) and then reads `n` integers, which represent the numbers on the cards.

2. **Count Occurrences:**
   - It initializes a dictionary `d` to count how many times each number appears on the cards. 

3. **Finding Suitable Numbers:**
   - It iterates through the dictionary to find two distinct numbers that appear exactly `n / 2` times. 

4. **Output:**
   - If it finds such two numbers, it prints "YES" followed by the two numbers. If not, it prints "NO".

**Potential Edge Cases:**

1. **All Cards Are the Same:**
   - If all cards have the same number (e.g., 2 cards both being 5), the program should correctly identify that it's impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose different numbers. The program outputs "NO" as expected.

2. **More Than Two Distinct Numbers:**
   - If there are several distinct numbers but none appear exactly `n/2` times, the program should output "NO". For instance, input like `4, 1, 2, 1, 3` should yield "NO". The program correctly identifies this scenario.

3. **Exactly Two Distinct Numbers with Correct Count:**
   - If there are exactly two distinct numbers, each appearing `n / 2` times, the program should output "YES" and the two numbers. For example, input like `4, 1, 1, 2, 2` should yield "YES 1 2". The program correctly identifies this.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Cases with Excess Cards:**
   - The program does not handle the case where there are exactly two numbers, but they do not meet the required count for fairness (e.g., `6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`). This should output "NO", but the logic does not accommodate this scenario properly because it only checks for numbers with count exactly `n/2` immediately without considering if there are enough distinct numbers to fill the total cards.

5. **Threshold Cases:**
   - Given `n` is guaranteed to be even, edge cases near the limits (like `n=2` with inputs `1, 1` or `1, 2`) should be handled appropriately, which the program does.

**Conclusion:**

After analyzing the program and possible edge cases, I have found a flaw:
- The program does not adequately handle the situation where there are not enough cards to be distributed fairly. It is only looking for exactly `n/2` occurrences per number. In cases where there are more than two distinct numbers but not suitable for equal distribution, it would incorrectly determine fairness or unfairness.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails for cases where there are two or more numbers but not enough to distribute evenly, which is not sufficiently checked. It should have considered scenarios where there could be an imbalance in card distribution, leading to unfair game conditions.
