The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of tabs, constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position, constrained to the range 1 ≤ pos ≤ n.
- `l` is an integer representing the left index of the segment that needs to remain open, constrained to the range 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.
- `r` is an integer representing the right index of the segment that needs to remain open, constrained to the range 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.

The function determines which tabs should remain open based on the specified segment [l, r] and the cursor position `pos`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four integers: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, and manage the state of tabs based on the cursor position and the specified range of tabs to remain open.
