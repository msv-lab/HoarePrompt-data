Postcondition: ***`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers representing the number of tabs, the current cursor position, and the left and right indices of the segment that needs to remain open, respectively. If `r` is equal to `n`, the value printed is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `n`, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)` and `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`; `close_both_sides` is printed as the minimum of `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`.***
