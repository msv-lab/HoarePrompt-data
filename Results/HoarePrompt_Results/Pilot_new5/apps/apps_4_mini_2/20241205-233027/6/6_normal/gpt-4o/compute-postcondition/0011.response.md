The variable `move_to_r` is assigned the value of `abs(pos - r)`. The values of `pos` and `r` are integers within the defined constraints, so `move_to_r` will also be a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n); `l` is an integer representing the left index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `r` is an integer representing the right index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `l` is greater than 1 or `r` is less than n; and `r` is less than `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to abs(pos - l); `move_to_r` is equal to abs(pos - r).

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n); `l` is an integer representing the left index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `r` is an integer representing the right index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `l` is greater than 1 or `r` is less than n; and `r` is less than `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to abs(pos - l); `move_to_r` is equal to abs(pos - r).**
