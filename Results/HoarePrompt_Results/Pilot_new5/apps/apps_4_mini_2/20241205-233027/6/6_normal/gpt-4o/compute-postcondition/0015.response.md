Postcondition: ***`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers representing the number of tabs, the current cursor position, and the left and right indices of the segment that needs to remain open, respectively. If `l` is equal to 1, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. Otherwise, if `r` is equal to `n`, the printed value is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If `r` is less than `n`, the program calculates `move_to_l` as `abs(pos - l)` and `move_to_r` as `abs(pos - r)`, and prints `close_both_sides` as the minimum of `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`.***
