`print(abs(pos - r) + 1)` computes the absolute difference between `pos` and `r`, then adds 1 to that result. The only variables involved in this operation are `pos` and `r`, whereas the variables `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged in their respective states as per the initial conditions.

Given that the current value of `l` is equal to 1, we note that `r` is within the bounds set by `l` and `n`, thus `r` can take any valid value between `l` and `n`, and `pos` can take any valid value as well.

The output will return a value based on this calculation, but since we don't have specific numerical values for `pos` and `r`, we express the result in terms of their relationship.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n); `l` is an integer equal to 1; `r` is an integer representing the right index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); the output is abs(pos - r) + 1.**
