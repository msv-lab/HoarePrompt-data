Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers with length `n`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, and `cycles` contains the previous cycles. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited` contains `True` for all nodes in the cycle starting from index 1, `x` is equal to the last visited index from the cycle, `cycle` contains all the indices from the cycle starting from 1, and `cycles` is updated to include the newly appended `cycle`.***
