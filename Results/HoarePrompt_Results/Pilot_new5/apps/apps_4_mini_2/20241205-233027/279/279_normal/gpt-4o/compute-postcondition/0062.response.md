Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` and `b` are lists of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `True` values, `cycles` contains all cycles found during the iterations, with each cycle being a list of indices that were visited in one complete traversal before returning to a previously visited index. If `n` is 0, then `cycles` is an empty list, indicating no elements to process.**
