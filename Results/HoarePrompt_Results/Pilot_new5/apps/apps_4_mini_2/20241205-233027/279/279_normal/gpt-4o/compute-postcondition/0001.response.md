The variable `data` is assigned the result of `input().split()`, which reads all the input data as a single string, splits it by whitespace, and creates a list of strings. The variables `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions, but their values may be indirectly impacted based on the input received.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\), and `p` and `b` are described as lists of length `n`, the new list `data` will contain the strings derived from the input but does not provide specific values for `p` or `b` at this point. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length equal to `n`; `data` is a list of strings from input split by whitespace.**
