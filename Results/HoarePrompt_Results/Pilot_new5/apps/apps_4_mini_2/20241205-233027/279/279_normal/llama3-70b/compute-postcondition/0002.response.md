The variable `b` is assigned a list of integers based on the input, where the input consists of `n` integers that are either 0 or 1. The previous state of `b` is not specified, so it is now defined by the input but still consists only of integers that are 0s and 1s. The other variables, `n` and `p`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers based on the input, and `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers based on the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on the input.**
