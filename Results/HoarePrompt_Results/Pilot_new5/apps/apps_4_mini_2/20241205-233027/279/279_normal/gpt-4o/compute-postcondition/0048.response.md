The value of `visited[x]` is set to `True`, where `x` is 2. Previously, `visited[2]` was `False`. This change affects only the `visited` list at index 2. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers with length `n`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `True` values for indices in the cycle starting from 1 but now `visited[2]` is `True`, `x` is 2, `cycles` is updated to include the newly appended `cycle`, `cycle` is an empty list.**
