The variable `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers with length `n`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `True` values for indices in the cycle starting from 1, `x` is updated to 2, `cycles` is updated to include the newly appended `cycle`, `cycle` is an empty list.
