The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The precondition states that `ans` is initialized to 1 if `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`. Since `ans` is updated, it will be `ans + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers based on the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on the input, if `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is increased by 1 and `b[i]` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers based on the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on the input, if `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is increased by 1 and `b[i]` remains 0.**
