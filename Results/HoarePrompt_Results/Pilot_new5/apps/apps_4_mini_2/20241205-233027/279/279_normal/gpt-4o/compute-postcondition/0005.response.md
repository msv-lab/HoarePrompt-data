The variable `visited` is initialized as a list of boolean values, all set to `False`, with a length equal to `n`. The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `visited`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a list of integers equal to `list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))`, `b` is a list of integers equal to `list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`.**
