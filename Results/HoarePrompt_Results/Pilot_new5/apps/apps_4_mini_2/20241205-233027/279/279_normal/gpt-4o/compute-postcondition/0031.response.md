The code `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. The previous value of `x` is 1, and `cycle` is an empty list.

After executing the code, the variable `cycle` is updated to contain the value `[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers with length `n`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with `visited[1]` set to `True`, `cycles` contains the previous cycles, `x` is 1, `cycle` is [1]**
