The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping each element in the slice of `data` from index `n + 1` to `2 * n + 1` to integers. The size of this slice is `n` elements, as it takes values directly from `data` starting from index `n + 1` to index `2 * n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a list of integers equal to `list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))`, `b` is a list of integers equal to `list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))`, `data` is a list of strings from input split by whitespace.**
