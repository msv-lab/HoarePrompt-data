Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, and `ans` is an integer. If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, while `i` remains as `n`. If `p[i]` equals `i + 1`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
