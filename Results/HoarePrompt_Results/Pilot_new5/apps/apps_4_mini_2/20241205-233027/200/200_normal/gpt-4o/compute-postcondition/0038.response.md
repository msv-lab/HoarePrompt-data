Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= v_i <= 10^9), and `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, value `-1` has been printed. Otherwise, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is unchanged, `remaining_kvass` is unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n`.***
