Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is an input positive integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers (1 <= v[i] <= 10^9), `low` is 0, `high` is min(v), `mid` is (min(v) + 1) // 2, and `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in v. The current value of `total` is less than `s`.***
