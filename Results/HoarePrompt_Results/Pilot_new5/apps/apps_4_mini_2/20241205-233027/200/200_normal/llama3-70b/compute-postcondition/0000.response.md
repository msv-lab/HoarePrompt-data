The values of `n` and `s` are assigned from the input after being split and converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `s` are not specified but must now be updated based on the input. The list `v` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is an input positive integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), and `v` is a list of n positive integers (1 <= v[i] <= 10^9).**
