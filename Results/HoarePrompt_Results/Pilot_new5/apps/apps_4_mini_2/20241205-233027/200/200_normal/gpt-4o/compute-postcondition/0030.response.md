Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000) that must be greater than 2; `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12); `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= v_i <= 10^9); `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`; `remaining_kvass` is less than or equal to `0`; `i` is 2; if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is equal to `volumes[2] - volumes[0]`, which is non-negative.***
