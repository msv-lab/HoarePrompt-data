The code initializes `days` as an empty list. The values of `n` and `f` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now an input positive integer representing the number of days in the shop's plan, `f` is now an input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, and `days` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is now an input positive integer representing the number of days in the shop's plan, `f` is now an input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is an empty list.**
