To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads input values for `n` (number of days) and `f` (number of days chosen for sell-out).
   - It then constructs a list `days`, where each element is a tuple `(k_i, l_i)` representing the products and clients for each day.

2. **Main Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The program initializes two lists: `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`.
   - For each day, it calculates:
     - `regular_sales` as the minimum of products and clients, which represents the maximum products sold without a sell-out.
     - `potential_sales_increase` as the difference between the maximum products that could be sold if the products were doubled and the regular sales. This captures the potential extra sales for days selected for sell-out.

3. **Calculating Total Sales**:
   - The total sales initially is the sum of `regular_sales`.
   - It then sorts `potential_sales_increase` in descending order and adds the top `f` values to the `total_sales`, which represents the additional sales from the selected sell-out days.

4. **Returning Result**:
   - The function returns the total sum of products sold, combining regular sales and the sales from the sell-out days.

**Correctness Analysis**:
- The program correctly calculates the regular sales for each day. 
- It accurately determines the potential sales increase based on the doubling of products for the chosen sell-out days.
- By selecting the `f` largest potential sales increases, the program effectively maximizes the total sales, aligning with the problem requirement to maximize the number of products sold.
- The logic follows directly from the constraints and rules set out in the problem description.

**Conclusion**:
Since the program handles all cases according to the problem description and ensures that the calculations for regular sales and potential increases are correct, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
