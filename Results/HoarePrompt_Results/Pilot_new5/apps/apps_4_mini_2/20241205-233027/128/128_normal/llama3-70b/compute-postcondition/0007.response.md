The code appends a new tuple (k, l) to the existing tuple `days`. This means that `days` will now contain an additional pair of values based on `k` and `l`, which were input integers. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `_` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, and `days` now contains the original elements plus the new tuple (k, l).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `_` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, and `days` now contains the tuple (k, l) appended to its previous elements.**
