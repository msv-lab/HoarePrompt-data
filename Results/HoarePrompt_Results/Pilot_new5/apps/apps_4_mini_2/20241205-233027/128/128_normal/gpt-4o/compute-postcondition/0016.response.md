The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of days, with the constraint that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `f` is a non-negative integer representing the number of days chosen for sell-out, constrained by \(0 \leq f \leq n\).
- `days` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers \( (k_i, l_i) \) representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for each day, with the constraints \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\).

After executing the function body, it returns `total_sales`, which is computed as the sum of `regular_sales` and the sum of the first `f` elements of `potential_sales_increase`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters representing the number of days, the number of days for sell-out, and a list of daily sales data, then return the total sales based on these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `f`, and `days`, and returns `total_sales`, which is the sum of `regular_sales` and the sum of the first `f` elements of `potential_sales_increase`.**
