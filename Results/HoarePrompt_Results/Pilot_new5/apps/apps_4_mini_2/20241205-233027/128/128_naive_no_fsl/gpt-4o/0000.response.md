Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to maximize sales in the shop over the specified number of days chosen for sell-outs. 

The key steps taken in the function `func_1` are:

1. It calculates the regular sales for each day using `min(k, l)`, which correctly accounts for the number of products available and the number of clients.
2. It computes the potential increase in sales for each day if that day were chosen for a sell-out, defined as `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`. This correctly reflects the additional sales that could occur due to doubling the available products on sell-out days.
3. It sums up the regular sales and adds the largest potential increases from the top `f` days when sorted in descending order.

The program also handles edge cases:
- If `f` is 0, no days are selected for sell-outs, and it will return the total of regular sales, which is correct.
- If all `k_i` values are 0 (no products), it will still return 0 as expected since no sales can occur.

Given that the logic adheres to the problem description and the program handles potential edge cases appropriately, I conclude that the code is correct.
