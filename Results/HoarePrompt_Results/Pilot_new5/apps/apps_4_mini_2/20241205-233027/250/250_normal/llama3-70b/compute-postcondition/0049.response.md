According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop initializes `j` at `i` (which is 2) and runs while `j` is less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 2 and `j` is currently 2, the loop can execute at least one more time. 

After the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 2, for the next iteration, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
