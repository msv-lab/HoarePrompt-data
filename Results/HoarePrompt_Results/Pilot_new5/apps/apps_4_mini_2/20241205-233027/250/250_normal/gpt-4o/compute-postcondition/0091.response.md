The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

- `n`: a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\).
- `l`: a positive integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\).
- `x`: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\).
- `y`: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\).
- `a`: a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler, where \(0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l\).

After executing the function body, the output is determined by various conditions on the parameters. However, specific return values based on these conditions are not provided. Thus, we only describe the parameters accepted by the function without detailing the outcomes based on various input conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, l, x, y, and a, where n is a positive integer, l is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers within specified ranges, and a is a list of n integers representing marks on a ruler.**
