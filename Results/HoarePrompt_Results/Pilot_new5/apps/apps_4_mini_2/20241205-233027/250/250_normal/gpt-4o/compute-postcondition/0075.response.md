Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a list of integers containing all the elements originally present in `marks`; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `new_marks` contains all values computed from the original marks based on the conditions of the loop for every mark in `marks` while `y_found` is False; `x_found` may be True or False depending on whether any valid conditions were met for `x`. If the loop does not execute, then `new_marks` remains an empty set and both `x_found` and `y_found` remain False.**
