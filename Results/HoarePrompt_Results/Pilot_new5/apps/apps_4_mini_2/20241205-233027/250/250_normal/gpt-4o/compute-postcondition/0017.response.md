Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `mark` is the next mark in the list; if either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is present in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is True, while `y_found` remains at least one of them is `False`; otherwise, `x_found` remains unchanged and `y_found` remains unchanged.***
