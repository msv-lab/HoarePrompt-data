The variable `x_found` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l, `marks` is now an input list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`, and `x_found` is `False`.
