Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`. If for some `mark` in `a`, either `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True` and `y_found` is `False`. Otherwise, the values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.***
