The operation `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value `mark - y` to the set `new_marks`. The variable `new_marks` is updated to include this new value. As per the conditions provided, nothing else has changed, and the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `x_found` is False; `y_found` is False; `new_marks` now contains the value `mark - y`; `y_found` is still False; none of the following conditions are true: `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` are in `marks_set`; the current value of `mark` satisfies either `mark - y + x in marks_set` or `mark - y - x in marks_set.**
