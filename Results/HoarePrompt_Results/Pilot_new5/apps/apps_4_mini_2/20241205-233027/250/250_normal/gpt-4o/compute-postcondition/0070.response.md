The code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` is a set, it will contain unique values. The previous conditions regarding `not x_found` and the expressions involving `mark`, `x`, and `y` do not impact the execution of this line, as this line is independent of those conditions.

Since `mark` is defined as the next element in `marks`, and `y` is a positive integer, `mark + y` will be a positive integer as well.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a list of integers with at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing unique values from `marks`; `y_found` is False; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `new_marks` now contains the value `mark + y`.**
