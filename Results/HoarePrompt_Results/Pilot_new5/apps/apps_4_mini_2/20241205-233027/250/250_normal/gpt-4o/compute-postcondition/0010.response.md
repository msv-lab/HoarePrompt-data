The variable `y_found` is assigned the value `True`. This means that previously, `y_found` was `False` (as it was not mentioned as being `True` before this line), and now it has been set to `True`. The initial conditions for all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is now `True`.**
