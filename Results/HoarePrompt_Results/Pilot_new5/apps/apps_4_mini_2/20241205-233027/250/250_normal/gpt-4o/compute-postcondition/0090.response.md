Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, the output value is 0. If either `x_found` or `y_found` is False, `new_marks` may be updated by excluding the last element if it is not empty, while `x_found` could either remain True or become False based on the conditions met for `x`. If `new_marks` becomes empty, then both `x_found` and `y_found` are False, resulting in a list `result` containing the current value of `x` followed by `y` as False, which is then printed.***
