The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to `additional_marks`. The variable `i` is the first element in `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`. The specific values of `i` and `j` are relevant to the output but are not given. Therefore, we denote them as `i` and `j` respectively. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` now includes the value `i + j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` includes the value `i + j`.**
