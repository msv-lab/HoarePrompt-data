The line of code `need_x = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `need_x`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and the expression `marks[j] - marks[i]`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `need_x` along with the unchanged conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_x` is True**
