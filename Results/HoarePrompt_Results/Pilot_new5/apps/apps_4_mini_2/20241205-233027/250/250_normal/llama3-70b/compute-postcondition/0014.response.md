The code assigns the value `True` to the variable `need_y`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `need_y` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `need_y` is True**.
