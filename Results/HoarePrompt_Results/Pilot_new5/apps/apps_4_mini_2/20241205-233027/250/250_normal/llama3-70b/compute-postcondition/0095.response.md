The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the value of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` iterable. Given the preconditions, `i` is the third element in `marks`, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. The sum `i + j` is confirmed to be less than or equal to `l` and is not currently in `marks`. Therefore, the addition of `i + j` will not violate any constraints provided in the initial state.

The state of `additional_marks` is updated to include this new value. The values of `n`, `marks`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `marks`, `additional_marks` has at least 1 element including the previous values, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, and now `additional_marks` includes the new value `i + j`.**
