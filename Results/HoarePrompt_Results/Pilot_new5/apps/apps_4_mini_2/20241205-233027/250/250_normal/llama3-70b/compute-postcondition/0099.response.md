Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `marks`, and `additional_marks` now contains at least one more element equal to `i + j`, where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks` when `i + j <= l and i + j not in marks`. If this condition does not hold, there are no changes to `additional_marks`.***
