According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the `marks` list. The provided state indicates that `marks` is a non-empty list, which means that there is at least one element for the loop to iterate over. 

Additionally, we need to consider the variables `x_found` and `y_found` which are initially set to `False`, but their values might change during the loop execution depending on the values in `marks`. The states `x` and `y` are already defined as positive integers within the specified range, and `new_marks` is an empty set, ready to be populated during the loop.

Thus, the only necessary conditions for the loop to execute correctly are already satisfied: `marks` must contain at least one element because it is specified as a non-empty list.

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `x_found` is `False`; `y_found` is `False`; `new_marks` is an empty set**
