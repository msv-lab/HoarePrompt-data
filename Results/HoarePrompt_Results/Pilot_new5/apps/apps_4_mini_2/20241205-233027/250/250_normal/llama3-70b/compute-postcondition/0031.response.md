The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state specifies that `need_x` is already `True`, so there is no change in its value. The values of the other variables remain unaffected and valid. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True if `marks[2] - marks[1]` equals `y`.**
