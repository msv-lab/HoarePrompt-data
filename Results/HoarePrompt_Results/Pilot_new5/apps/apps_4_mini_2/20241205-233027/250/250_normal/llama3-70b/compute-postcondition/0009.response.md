The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, and the condition regarding `marks[j] - marks[i]` being equal to `y` is still valid. The output will reflect that `need_y` is now set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, `need_y` is True**.
