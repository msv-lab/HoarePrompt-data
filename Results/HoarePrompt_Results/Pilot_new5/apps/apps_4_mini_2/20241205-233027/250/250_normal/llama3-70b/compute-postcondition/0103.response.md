Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `marks`, `additional_marks` includes all values of the form `i + j` where `j` belongs to the original `additional_marks`, `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, and `i + j` is not in `marks`. If no conditions are met for the loop to execute, `additional_marks` remains unchanged.**
