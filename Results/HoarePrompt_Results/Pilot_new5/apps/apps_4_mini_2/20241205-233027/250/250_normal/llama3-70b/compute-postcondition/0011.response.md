According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100000. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n` (which will be the case since `j` will be 1 and `n` is at least 2). 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` remains a positive integer between 2 and 100000.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` becomes 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, `j` is 1**.
