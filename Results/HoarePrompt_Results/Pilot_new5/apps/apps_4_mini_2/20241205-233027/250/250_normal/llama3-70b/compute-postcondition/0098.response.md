The variable `additional_marks` has an operation that appends `i + j` to it. Given the conditions that `i + j` must be less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`, we can conclude that the new value of `additional_marks` will be extended by one element. The specific value of `i + j` is unknown but is governed by the stated conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `marks`, `additional_marks` now contains at least one more element equal to `i + j`, where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`.**
