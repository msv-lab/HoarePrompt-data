Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers containing at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `y_found` remains unchanged; `x_found` remains unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
