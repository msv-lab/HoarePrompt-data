The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Given the initial state, `i` is the second element in `marks`, and `j` satisfies the condition that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not present in `marks`. 

Since `additional_marks` must have at least one more element and we are appending `i + j`, after executing this line, the state of `additional_marks` changes. 

The other variables remain unchanged:

- `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000)
- `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements
- `i` remains the second element in `marks`
- `j` still satisfies the condition that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not present in `marks`

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `additional_marks` has one more element, which is `i + j`.**
