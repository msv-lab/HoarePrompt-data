Functionality: ** The function accepts four parameters: a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `l`, two positive integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` distinct integers `marks` within the range from 0 to `l`. It checks if there are two indices in `marks` such that the difference between the values at those indices equals `x` or `y`. If there are no such pairs, it adds `x` and/or `y` to a new list called `additional_marks`. It then computes potential new marks by adding elements from `marks` to those in `additional_marks` as long as the sum does not exceed `l` and is not already in `marks`. Finally, it outputs the count of unique additional marks and the marks themselves.**
