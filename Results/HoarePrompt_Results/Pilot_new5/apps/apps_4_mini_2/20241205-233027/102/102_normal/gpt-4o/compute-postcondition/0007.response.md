The code outputs the values of `x` and `y`. The previous value of `x` is 0, and `y` is equal to `n // b`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `b` is an input integer. The values of `a`, `n`, and `b` are not changed by the print statement, so they remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `n // b; and the values printed are `0` and `y`.**
