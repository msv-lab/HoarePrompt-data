To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: Three integers - `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Output**: If it is possible to find non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`, print "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`. If not possible, print "NO".

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `input()`.
2. **Loop Through Possible Values of `x`**: 
   - The loop iterates over `x` from `0` to `n // a`. This is appropriate because `x` must be non-negative and cannot exceed `n/a` (as buying more than `n/a` bottles would exceed the budget `n`).
3. **Calculate `y`**: 
   - For each `x`, `y` is computed as `(n - x * a) // b`, which denotes the maximum number of Bars bars that can be bought after spending `x * a` burles on Ber-Cola.
4. **Check Validity**:
   - The program checks whether the combination of `x` and `y` yields exactly `n` burles. If it does, it prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`, then exits.
5. **No Solution Case**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any valid `(x, y)`, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program correctly implements a brute-force search over the feasible values of `x`, calculating the corresponding `y` and checking if the total spent equals `n`. Given the constraints (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000), the approach will always terminate because:

- The loop executes at most `n // a + 1` times, which is bounded and will eventually reach the conclusion of either finding a valid pair or exhausting all possibilities.
- The calculations ensure that both `x` and `y` remain non-negative integers.

### Conclusion:
- The program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description.
- There are no cases where it would fail to find valid `(x, y)` pairs or incorrectly print results based on the range of inputs allowed.

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
