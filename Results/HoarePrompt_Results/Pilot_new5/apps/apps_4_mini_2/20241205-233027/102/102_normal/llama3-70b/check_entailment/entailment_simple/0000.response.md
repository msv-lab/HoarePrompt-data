The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible for Vasya to buy some combination of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars such that the total cost is exactly `n` burles.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads values for `n`, `a`, and `b` correctly from the input.
2. **Loop through Possible Purchases**: The program uses a loop that iterates from `0` to `n // a`. For each `x` (the number of Ber-Cola bottles), it calculates `y` (the number of Bars bars) by the formula:
   \[
   y = \frac{n - x \cdot a}{b}
   \]
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, there is a conditional check to see if the combination of `x` and `y` satisfies the equation:
   \[
   x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n
   \]
   If this holds true, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`.
4. **Exit Condition**: If no valid pair `(x, y)` is found after the loop completes, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:
- The program effectively explores all possible values of `x` that Vasya can afford with his budget `n` given the price `a` for the bottles. For each `x`, it computes a corresponding `y` based on the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles.
- The conditions ensure that `y` is a non-negative integer, because if `(n - x * a)` is negative, `y` will be negative and hence invalid.
- The output format matches the requirements of the problem description. When a valid combination is found, it outputs "YES" and the values `(x, y)`; if no combination is valid, it outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine whether Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles on combinations of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. It effectively checks all valid combinations and correctly handles both possible outcomes.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
