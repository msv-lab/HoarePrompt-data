Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from standard input, which are correctly defined to fall within the specified ranges (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000).

2. **Logic to Determine Purchases**: The core logic of the program uses a for loop that iterates over possible values of `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) from 0 up to `n // a`. For each possible value of `x`, it checks if the remaining money after buying `x` bottles can be perfectly divided by the cost of a Bars bar (`b`). This is done with the condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0`.

3. **Non-Negative Integer Solutions**: If a valid `x` is found, the program calculates `y` (the number of Bars bars) as `(n - x * a) // b`. Since both `x` and `y` are derived from valid calculations of `n`, `a`, and `b`, they will always be non-negative integers if a solution exists.

4. **Output**: Upon finding a valid solution, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If no valid combination is found after checking all possible `x`, it correctly prints "NO".

5. **Coverage of Edge Cases**: The logic correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` is less than both `a` and `b`, or when `n` is a multiple of either `a` or `b`.

The algorithm effectively explores all combinations of `x` and corresponding `y`, ensuring that all possible non-negative integer solutions to `x * a + y * b = n` are considered.

In conclusion, the program accurately meets the requirements of the problem description and will return the correct output for all valid inputs within the specified constraints. Thus, the correctness of the program is validated.
