The code `exit()` does not change any variable values; it simply terminates the program execution. Thus, the output state will reflect that the program has exited without changing the values of `n`, `a`, `x`, or `y`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`; the string 'YES' has been printed and the program has exited.**
