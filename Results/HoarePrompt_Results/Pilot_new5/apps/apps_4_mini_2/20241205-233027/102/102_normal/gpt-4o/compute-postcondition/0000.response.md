The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will be an integer input by the user. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and they are still within the range of 1 to 10,000,000. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000; `n` is an input integer.**
