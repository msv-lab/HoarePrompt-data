Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Kolya can spend exactly `n` game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. It systematically iterates through possible purchases of houses and cars, calculating the remaining balance after each purchase. The critical check is whether the remaining balance can be evenly divided by the cost of a computer, which ensures that all game-coins can be accounted for.

To elaborate:
1. It correctly iterates over the number of houses `a` that can be bought (`n // house_cost + 1`).
2. For each possible `a`, it computes the remaining game-coins after buying `a` houses.
3. It then iterates over the number of cars `b` that can be bought with the remaining coins.
4. After buying `b` cars, it checks if the remaining coins can be completely spent on computers by verifying if `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program should be able to handle any input in the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) accurately, thus fulfilling the problem description.
