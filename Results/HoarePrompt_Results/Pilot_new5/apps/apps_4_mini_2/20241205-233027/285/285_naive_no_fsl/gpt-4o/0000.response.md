Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if Kolya can spend exactly `n` game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. It does so by iterating through all possible amounts of houses he could buy, and for each amount of houses, it calculates the remaining coins. Then, for that remaining amount, it checks how many cars he can buy and finally checks if the remaining coins can be exactly spent on computers.

The key points of correctness include:

1. The outer loop iterates over all possible numbers of houses (`a`), which ranges from 0 up to `n // house_cost`.
2. For each fixed number of houses, the inner loop iterates over all possible numbers of cars (`b`), which ranges from 0 up to the maximum that can be bought with the remaining coins after buying the houses.
3. It checks if the remaining coins after buying `a` houses and `b` cars can be fully spent on computers by checking if the remaining coins modulo the computer's cost is zero.
4. If any valid combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` is found, the function returns 'YES'. If all combinations are exhausted and none match, it returns 'NO'.

Given the constraints of the problem, the program will always evaluate all possible combinations in a finite manner, ensuring it covers all potential cases. Thus, there is no input case that can be found where the program would return an incorrect result according to the problem's requirements.
