The variable `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given that `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, `b` is 0, and `car_cost` is 123456, we can calculate `remaining_after_cars`.

Since `b` is 0, the term `b * car_cost` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `remaining_after_cars` is simply equal to `remaining_after_houses`, which is `n`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n`.**
