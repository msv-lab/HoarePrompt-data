The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the program execution stops upon calling `exit()`. Therefore, the output state does not reflect any changes to the variables but indicates that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2469134, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, `c` is `(n - 2469134) // 1234, and the program has exited.**
