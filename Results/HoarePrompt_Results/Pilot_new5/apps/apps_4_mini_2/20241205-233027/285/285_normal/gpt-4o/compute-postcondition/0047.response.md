The value of `b` is already defined as `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. Therefore, `b` is calculated based on the division of `remaining_after_houses` by `car_cost`, and then incremented by 1. This means `b` represents the number of cars that can be purchased with the remaining amount after houses, plus one additional car.

Now, `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. This calculation subtracts the total cost of the cars (which is `b * car_cost`) from `remaining_after_houses`.

Thus, the impact on the output state is that `remaining_after_cars` is updated based on the values of `remaining_after_houses`, `b`, and `car_cost`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_after_houses` is unchanged, `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.**
