The value of `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the expression `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The variable `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged, and `b` has been updated to (previous `b` + 1). Therefore, the Output State will reflect this change in `b` and the calculated value of `remaining_after_cars`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567; `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged; `b` is (previous b + 1); `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.**
