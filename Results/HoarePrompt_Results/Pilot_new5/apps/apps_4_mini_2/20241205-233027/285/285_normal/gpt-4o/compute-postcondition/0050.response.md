Output State: **`remaining_after_houses` is unchanged, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` for all b in the range from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost` for all b except possibly the last one, if it exits the loop without returning 'YES', `b` is equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` after the last iteration, and the values of all other variables remain unchanged.**
