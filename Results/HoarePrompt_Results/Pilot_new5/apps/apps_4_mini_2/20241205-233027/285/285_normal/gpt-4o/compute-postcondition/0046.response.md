According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b` and the computed range. The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is currently at its last value, which can be calculated as `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `remaining_after_houses` must remain unchanged, and `b` must be equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

State: **`remaining_after_houses` is unchanged, `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`**
