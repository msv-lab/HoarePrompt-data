The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, none of the variable values change, but the program flow stops. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1481479, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, `c` is equal to (n - 1481479) // 1234, and 'YES' has been printed, while the program execution is halted.
