The code `print('YES')` does not change the values of any variables; it simply outputs the string 'YES'. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state of the variables without any modifications.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2599580; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `c` is recalculated as `(n - 2469134) // 1234` and 'YES' is printed.**
