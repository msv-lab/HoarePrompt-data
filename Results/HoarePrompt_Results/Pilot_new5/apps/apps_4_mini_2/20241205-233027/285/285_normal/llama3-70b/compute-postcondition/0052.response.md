The code `exit()` does not change any variable states or values; it simply terminates the execution of the program. Therefore, the states of all the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2599580; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `c` is recalculated as `(n - 2469134) // 1234` and 'YES' is printed; program execution terminated.**
