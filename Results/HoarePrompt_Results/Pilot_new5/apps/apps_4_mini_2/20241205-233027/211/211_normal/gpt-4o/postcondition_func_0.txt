The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `A` of `n` integers, each of which lies within the range -1000 to 1000. It computes the sum of the integers in `A`. If the sum is not equal to 0, it prints 'YES', followed by '1' and the value of `n`. If the sum is equal to 0 and at least one integer in `A` is non-zero, it prints 'YES', then '2', followed by two ranges: one starting from index 1 to the first non-zero element and the second from the next index to `n`. If all elements in `A` are zero, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle unexpected input types or values outside the specified ranges.
