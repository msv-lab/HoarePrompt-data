The function `func` does not have parameters directly accepted in its definition, suggesting it might be using global variables or accessing input in some other way. However, based on the provided constraints, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `A` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000.

Since the output behavior is not specified, we cannot determine what the function exactly returns or how it manipulates `A`. However, based on the context, we can outline the expected behavior based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list A of n integers where each integer is within the range -1000 to 1000. The specific output behavior of the function is not defined.**
