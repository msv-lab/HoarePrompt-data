In the provided code, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. Given that `i` starts at 1 and `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, after execution, `prefix_sum[2]` will be updated based on the sum of `prefix_sum[1]` and `a[1]`.

The impact of the code:
- `prefix_sum[2]` will be updated to `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`, which means:
  - Since `prefix_sum[1] = a[0]`, we have `prefix_sum[2] = a[0] + a[1]`.

The values of `n`, `i`, `A`, and `prefix_sum[0]` remain unchanged. Only `prefix_sum[2]` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1]`, with all other entries still zero.**
