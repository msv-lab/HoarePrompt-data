The `print` statement outputs '1' followed by the value of `n`. The variables `A` and `total_sum` remain unchanged and their states are still valid. The output does not affect any variables directly, but it produces a display. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`; the current value of `total_sum` is not equal to 0; output is '1', `n` is the input positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`; the current value of `total_sum` is not equal to 0; output is '1', `n` is the input positive integer.**
