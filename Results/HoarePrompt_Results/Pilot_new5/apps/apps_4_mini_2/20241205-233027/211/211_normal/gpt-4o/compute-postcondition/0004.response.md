The code simply prints the string 'YES' to the output. The values of the variables `n`, `A`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged. The current state of `total_sum` is still not equal to 0, and since there are no changes to the variables or any calculations, the output state reflects that the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`; the current value of `total_sum` is not equal to 0; output is 'YES'.**
