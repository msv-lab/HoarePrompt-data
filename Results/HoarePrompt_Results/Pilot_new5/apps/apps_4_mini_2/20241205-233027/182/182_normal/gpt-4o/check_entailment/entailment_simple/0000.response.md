Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description for a couple of reasons:

1. **Counter-clockwise Rotation Handling**: The problem description requires that the deviation from vertical should be minimized by performing 90-degree clockwise turns. The program calculates the number of clockwise turns needed based on the normalized angle, but it does not effectively account for the cases where the camera is rotated counter-clockwise (negative angles). 

2. **Calculation of Turns**: The formula used to calculate `turns` in the program `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` does not accurately reflect the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to achieve minimal deviation from vertical. Specifically, it does not consider the scenario where negative angles lead to a situation where more than one turn may be needed to correctly align the image.

For example, if the input is `-60`, the normalized angle would be `300` (since `-60 % 360 = 300`), and the calculation would result in `turns = (360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 0`, which is incorrect as per the problem description where the expected output is `3`. 

Thus, the program does not adhere to the problem's requirements in all cases, particularly when handling negative rotation angles, leading to incorrect results for such inputs.
