Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements described in the problem statement for several reasons:

1. **Normalization of Angle**: The program normalizes the angle with `normalized_angle = x % 360`, which is correct. However, it only considers the positive equivalent of the angle and does not account for negative angles appropriately, which can lead to incorrect calculations of required turns.

2. **Calculation of Turns**: The formula used to calculate the number of turns is `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. This calculation intends to determine how many 90-degree clockwise turns are needed. However, it does not correctly translate the initial angle into the minimum number of turns required to achieve the goal of aligning the image.

3. **Counterclockwise Misinterpretation**: The program calculates how many 90-degree turns are needed to align with the positive x-axis based on a counterclockwise rotation, but the problem statement specifically requires the calculation of clockwise turns only. Therefore, for angles like -60 degrees, the program does not handle the conversion and results in the wrong number of turns.

4. **Failure to Minimize Turns**: The approach used does not adequately minimize the turns based on absolute deviation, nor does it return the minimum number of clockwise turns as required. For example, the program fails to consider that after 3 clockwise turns from a -60 degree orientation, the image would be minimally deviated with only 30 degrees remaining.

The program does not adequately represent cases like `-60` given in the problem statement, where it should return `3` but does not. Hence, the provided implementation does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases.
