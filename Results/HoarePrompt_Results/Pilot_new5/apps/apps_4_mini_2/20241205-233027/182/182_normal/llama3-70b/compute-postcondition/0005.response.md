The expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` calculates the result based on the value of `x`. The original state specifies that `x` can be between 0 and 359 if it is non-negative, or between -359 and 0 if it is negative. Since `x` is not equal to 0, we consider both cases.

1. If `x` is between 0 and 359:
   - `x + 90 - 1` will range from `89` to `448`.
   - Dividing by `90` gives the range from `0` to `4.977...`.
   - Taking the floor value (using `//`) gives integers from `0` to `4`.
   - Applying `% 4` will yield results in `{0, 1, 2, 3}`.

2. If `x` is between -359 and 0:
   - `x + 90 - 1` will range from `-270` to `89`.
   - Dividing by `90` gives the range from `-3` to `0.977...`.
   - Taking the floor value (using `//`) gives integers from `-3` to `0`.
   - Applying `% 4` will yield results in `{1, 2, 3, 0}`.

Thus, the output would be a single integer representing one of these results. The value of `x` remains unchanged after the calculation.

Output State: **`x` is equal to `x % 360`, where `x` was originally in the range of either 0 to 359 or -359 to 0, and print outputs either 0, 1, 2, or 3.**
