To assess the correctness of the given program, we will first analyze the provided problem description, the code, and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to align an image deviated by a given angle \( x \) (which can be positive for clockwise rotation or negative for counter-clockwise rotation) to a vertical position.

### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Normalization**: The code normalizes the angle by taking \( x \mod 360 \). This gives us a value between 0 and 359 degrees.
2. **Calculating Turns**: The code then calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to reach a vertical position by using the formula \((360 - normalized\_angle) // 90 \mod 4\).
   - The term \((360 - normalized\_angle)\) computes how much rotation is necessary to bring the angle to 0 degrees, which is the target vertical position.
   - Dividing by 90 gives the number of 90-degree rotations needed.
   - The modulo operation ensures that we are considering only the equivalent of up to three turns (since four turns would return to the original position).

### Potential Edge Cases:
- If the angle \( x \) is exactly 0, the expected output should be 0 turns.
- For angles like \( 90, 180, \) and \( 270 \), the function should return 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
- If the angle is negative (for example, \( -90 \)), the normalization should handle this correctly, and the output should be the same as for \( 270 \) degrees.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that:
- The function normalizes the angle within the range of 0 to 359 degrees.
- It calculates the number of clockwise turns needed, which suggests it is working to minimize the deviation from vertical.

However, the code only ensures minimum turns in one direction (i.e., clockwise), and does not consider equivalences for angles that could be aligned with fewer turns by rotating in the other direction.

### Example Validation:
- **Input: 60**: 
  - Normalized angle: \( 60 \)
  - Turns calculated: \( (360 - 60) // 90 \mod 4 = 3 \)
  - The expected output is 1 based on the description.
  
- **Input: -60**:
  - Normalized angle: \( 300 \) (since \(-60 \mod 360 = 300\))
  - Turns calculated: \( (360 - 300) // 90 \mod 4 = 0 \) (since 60 degrees is reached before completing any turns).
  - The expected output is 3 based on the description.

### Conclusion:
The code does not work correctly for the provided cases. Specifically:
- The calculation of the turns does not account for the scenario where the input angle is a positive or negative value that can achieve vertical alignment with fewer turns than calculated. 
  - For example, \( 60 \) degrees should yield \( 1 \) turn, but the formula erroneously computes \( 3 \).

Thus, due to the issues with the calculation when normalizing the angles and determining the necessary turns, the program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
