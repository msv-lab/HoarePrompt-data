The code `exit()` terminates the program execution immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program will stop at this point. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the termination of the program.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is -90; `dir` is not 'North'; the program has exited.**
