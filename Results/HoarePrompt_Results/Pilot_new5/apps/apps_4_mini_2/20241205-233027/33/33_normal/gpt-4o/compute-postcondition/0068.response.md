Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50; `position` is a value between 1 and 20000. If `valid` is True, then `position` reflects the outcome of valid movements, and `t` and `dir` remain unchanged. If `position` is 0, the output is 'NO', while `valid` remains True, indicating that no invalid movements occurred.***
