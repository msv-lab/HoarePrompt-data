According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer in the range of 1 to 50, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute at least once because `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop will iterate `n` times, and the underscore (`_`) indicates that the loop variable is not being used within the loop body.

At the start of the first iteration, `position` is 0. Since the loop will run `n` times, `position` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The `valid` state is also not directly relevant to the loop execution itself.

Therefore, the states that need to be reported are based on the initial conditions and the understanding that the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `position` is 0, `valid` is True**
