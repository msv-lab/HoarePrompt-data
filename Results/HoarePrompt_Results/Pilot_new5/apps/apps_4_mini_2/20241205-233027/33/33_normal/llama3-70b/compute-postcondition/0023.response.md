The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. However, it does not affect any of the existing variables, so their states remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `curr_lat` and `dir` indicate that the program is continuing its execution without any modifications to these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is 90; `dir` is not 'South'.**
