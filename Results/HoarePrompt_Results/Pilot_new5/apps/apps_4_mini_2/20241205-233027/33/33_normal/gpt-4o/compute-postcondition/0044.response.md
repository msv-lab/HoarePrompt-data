According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the current iteration count is less than `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the loop must have executed fewer times than `n` at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, the current iteration count must be increased by 1 for the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, the current iteration count was less than `n`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the current iteration count must be increased by 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the current iteration count is less than `n`, and the current iteration count is now one more than before, which is less than `n`. The state of `t` remains unchanged.**
