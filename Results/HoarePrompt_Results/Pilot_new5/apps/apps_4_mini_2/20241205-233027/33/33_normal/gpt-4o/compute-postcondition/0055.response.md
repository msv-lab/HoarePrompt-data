Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the current iteration count is less than `n`, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is the input string for `dir`. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East' and `position` is 0 or 20000, then `valid` is set to False. Otherwise, the state of `valid` remains unchanged.***
