In the given code snippet, `position` is decremented by the value of `t`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `position` starts at 0, we need to evaluate the impact of this operation on the `position` variable and how it affects `valid`.

- The current value of `position` is 0, and it will be subtracted by `t`. 
- If `position - t` is less than 0, which will be the case if `t` is greater than 0, then `valid` will be set to `False`.

Since `t` is an input integer and could be any positive integer, when `position` is decremented by `t`, it will result in a negative value, thus causing `valid` to be set to `False`.

Now, let's summarize the output state:

- `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 50.
- `position` will be `0 - t`, which is a negative value.
- `valid` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `position` is a negative value equal to `0 - t`, `valid` is False.**
