According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `n` times, and we are currently at the end of the previous iteration. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, if the loop has executed `n` times, it cannot execute again unless the value of `n` is greater than the number of executed iterations. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have executed the loop for one iteration (since we're considering the next iteration). Thus, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. The loop variable in this case is represented by `_`, which is a conventional placeholder and does not need to be tracked. 

Since the loop has executed one time, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain the same, and we should be ready for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and must be greater than 1**
