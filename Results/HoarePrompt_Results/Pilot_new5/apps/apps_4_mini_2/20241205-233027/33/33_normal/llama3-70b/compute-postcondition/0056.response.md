Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is an integer. If `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then `curr_lat` remains unchanged and the program execution exits. If `curr_lat` is outside the valid range of -90 to 90, it also remains unchanged, and the program exits, making the value of 'NO' irrelevant.***
