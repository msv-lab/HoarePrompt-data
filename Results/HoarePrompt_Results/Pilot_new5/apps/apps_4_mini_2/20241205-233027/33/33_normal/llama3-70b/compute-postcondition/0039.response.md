Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 1; `t` is an integer value converted from input. If `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North', 'NO' is printed and the program exits. If `curr_lat` is within the valid range but not equal to -90 or `dir` is 'North', the program continues execution.***
