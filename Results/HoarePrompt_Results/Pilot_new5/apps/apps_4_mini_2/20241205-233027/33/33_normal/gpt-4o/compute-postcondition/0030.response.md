After executing the code snippet, the variable `t` is converted from a string to an integer. The value of `t` is updated accordingly. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the current iteration count is less than `n`, `t` is now an integer, and `dir` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the current iteration count is less than `n`, `t` is now an integer, `dir` is an input string.**
