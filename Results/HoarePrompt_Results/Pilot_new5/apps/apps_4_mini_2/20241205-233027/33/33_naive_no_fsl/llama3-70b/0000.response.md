Correctness: **False**

The program has a flaw in how it checks for valid movements when Limak is at the poles. Specifically, it does not handle situations correctly where the path involves "West" or "East" movements when Limak is at either pole.

Here are the problematic cases:

1. If Limak is at the North Pole (curr_lat = 90) and the instruction is to move "East" or "West", the program does not explicitly prevent this move. According to the problem description, he should only be able to move "South" at the North Pole.

2. Conversely, if Limak is at the South Pole (curr_lat = -90) and the instruction is to move "East" or "West", the program does not prevent this either. Again, it should only allow movement "North" when at the South Pole.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
1000 South
500 East
```

In this case, Limak would start at the North Pole, move 1000 km South but then attempt to move East, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program fails to account for these restrictions correctly, making it incorrect.
