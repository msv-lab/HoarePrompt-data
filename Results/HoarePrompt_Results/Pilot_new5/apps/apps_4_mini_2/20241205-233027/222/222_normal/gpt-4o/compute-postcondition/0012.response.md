The `print(len(positions))` statement outputs the length of the `positions` list. The initial state specifies that `positions` contains values generated by the formula `1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3, ..., (2 * k + 1)*(m - 1) + 1`. 

To determine the length of `positions`, we note that it is structured based on the pattern of the formula given. However, the specific length cannot be calculated without knowing the values of `k` and `m`. 

The values of `i` and `n` are unaffected by the execution of the code. Therefore, we have:
- The length of `positions` is unknown, but it is valid based on the values of `k` and `m`.
- `i` remains `2 * k * m + m + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k * m + m + 1`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`positions` contains all values generated by the formula; `i` is `2 * k * m + m + 1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k * m + m + 1`**.
