The code initializes `positions` as an empty list. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), and `positions` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `positions` is an empty list.**
