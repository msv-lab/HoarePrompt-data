The code `positions.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `positions`. The variable `i` is initially 1, and since `positions` is an empty list, it will now contain the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `positions` now contains the integer 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `positions` is [1], `i` is 1**
