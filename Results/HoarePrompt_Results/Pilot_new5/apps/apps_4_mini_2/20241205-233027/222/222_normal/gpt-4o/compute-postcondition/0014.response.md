The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 1000. After executing the function body, the behavior of the function is not specified in the output provided. Therefore, I cannot describe specific return values or cases. 

However, based on the parameter constraints, we can summarize that the function is designed to operate with a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, where n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) and k is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000). The specific return values of the function are not provided.**
