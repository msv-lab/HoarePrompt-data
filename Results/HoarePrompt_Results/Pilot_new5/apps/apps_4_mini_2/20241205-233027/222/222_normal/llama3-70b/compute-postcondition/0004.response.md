Let's analyze the impact of the code on the program.

1. The list `res` is empty initially.
2. The value of `i` is 0.
3. The value of `k` is a non-negative integer, and `k * 2 + 1` will produce an odd integer (since `k` is non-negative).
4. The expression `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` calculates to `0 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `1`.

Now, `1` is appended to the list `res`. The list `res`, which was previously empty, now contains one element, which is `1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `l` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value 1.**
