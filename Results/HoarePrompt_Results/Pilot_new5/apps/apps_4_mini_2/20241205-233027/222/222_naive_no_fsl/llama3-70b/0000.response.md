To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem involves turning over skewers arranged in a line, such that turning a specific skewer also affects the nearby skewers based on the parameter `k`. The goal is to find the minimum number of turn operations required to ensure all skewers are turned.

Let's break down the key components of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (the range of skewers turned over on either side of the selected skewer).

2. **Calculation of Minimum Actions**: The line `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` calculates the minimum number of actions needed to turn all skewers. The formula effectively divides the total number of skewers `n` by the number of skewers affected by each turn operation, which is `k * 2 + 1`.

3. **Determining Which Skewers to Turn**: The loop `for i in range(l): res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` generates the indices of the skewers to turn. This uses the formula to select skewer indices that will cover the entire range.

4. **Output**: The number of actions and the selected skewer indices are printed.

Now, let's verify if this logic works in all cases by examining edge cases:

- **Edge Case 1**: When `n = 1` and `k = 0`. The expected output is:
  ```
  1
  1
  ```
  The program should correctly output `1` and turn skewer `1`. It does.

- **Edge Case 2**: When `n = 3` and `k = 1`. The expected output is:
  ```
  1
  2
  ```
  The program should turn skewer `2`, which also turns `1` and `3`. It does.

- **Edge Case 3**: When `n = 4` and `k = 1`. The expected output is:
  ```
  2
  1 4
  ```
  The program correctly chooses to turn skewer `1` (turning `1`, `2`) and `4` (turning `3`, `4`).

- **Edge Case 4**: When `n = 6` and `k = 2`. The expected output is:
  ```
  2
  1 5
  ```
  The program should turn skewer `1` (turning `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) and `5` (turning `4`, `5`, `6`), which it does.

In examining these cases, the program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description.

After analyzing the program against these potential edge cases and confirming that it behaves as expected for each, I am led to conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
