Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the grasshopper can reach the insect based on the problem description. Specifically, there are a couple of issues:

1. **Modulo Operation**: The expression `(g + i * k) % n` is used to access the cells in the string. This is incorrect because it could lead to wrapping around the string in a way that is not intended. The grasshopper should only jump to the right or left in a linear fashion, and should not wrap around to the other end of the string. The grasshopper should only check for obstacles in the range from index `g` to index `t` without wrapping around using modulo. 

2. **Checking Obstacles**: The current implementation incorrectly allows for jumps that could be blocked by obstacles. The condition `all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))` does not properly check if the grasshopper can reach the target cell without encountering any obstacles since it may index into invalid or unintended positions due to the modulo operation.

3. **Correct Jump Direction**: The program does not take into account the direction of movement required to reach the insect (if `g` is to the left of `t`, it should only check cells to the right, and vice versa). The program currently evaluates both directions uniformly without regard for their positions.

To summarize, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description properly because it does not account for the linear nature of the line and may incorrectly evaluate the path the grasshopper can take to reach the insect. Therefore, the implementation is not correct.
