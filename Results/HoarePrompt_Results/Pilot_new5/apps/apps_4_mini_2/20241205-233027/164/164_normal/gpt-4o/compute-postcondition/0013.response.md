`reachable` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and the conditions regarding `G_pos`, `T_pos`, `n`, and `k` remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos` and now `reachable` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos`, `reachable` is True.**
