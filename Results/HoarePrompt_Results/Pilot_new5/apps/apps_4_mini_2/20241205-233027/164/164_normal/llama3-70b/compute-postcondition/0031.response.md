The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes an input string that contains exactly one 'G' (representing the starting point) and one 'T' (representing the target point), which is of length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The string can also contain any combination of '.' (representing empty cells) and '#' (representing obstacles). 

After executing the function body, it will return a specific output based on the relationship between 'G', 'T', '.' and '#'. Since no specific output conditions are provided, we can only detail the input requirements.

Functionality: **The function accepts an input string of length n containing exactly one 'G', one 'T', and any combination of '.' and '#', where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.**
