The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or conditional statement that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos`, `reachable` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.
