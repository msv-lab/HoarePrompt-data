The code assigns the values of `n` and `k` from user input, which is split and converted to integers. The initial state provides constraints on `n` and `k`, but without specific values given in the input, we cannot determine precise values for `n` and `k`. The other variables defined by the input string representing the cells remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), and the input string representing the cells has a length of `n`, containing exactly one 'G' and one 'T', with '.' for empty cells and '#' for obstacles; `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input.**
