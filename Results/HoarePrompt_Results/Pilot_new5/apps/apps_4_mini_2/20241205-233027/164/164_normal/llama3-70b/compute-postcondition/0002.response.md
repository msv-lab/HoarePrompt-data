The code initializes the variables `g` and `t` to -1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged as they were not modified. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions for `n`, `k`, and `s`, while showing the updated values for `g` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `s` is an input string; `g` is -1, `t` is -1**
