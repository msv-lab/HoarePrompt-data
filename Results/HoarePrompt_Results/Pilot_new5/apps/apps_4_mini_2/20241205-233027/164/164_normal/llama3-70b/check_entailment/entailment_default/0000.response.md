To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the code based on the given problem description and the output hints.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Problem Description:
1. The grasshopper can jump `k` cells to the left or right, ignoring obstacles (cells with `#`).
2. We must check if the grasshopper can reach the insect from its starting position.
3. The characters in the string represent:
   - `.`: empty cell
   - `#`: obstacle
   - `G`: starting position of the grasshopper
   - `T`: target position of the insect

### Logical Flow of the Code:
1. The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, and a string `s`.
2. It identifies the indices of `G` and `T`.
3. If either `G` or `T` is not found, it prints "NO".
4. It checks if the absolute difference in indices between `G` and `T` is divisible by `k`.
5. It checks whether there are any obstacles (`#`) in the path by iterating through the jumps.
6. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases:
- The code uses `(g + i * k) % n`, which suggests it might be treating the string as circular, but the problem does not imply this.
- If `G` is at the start of the string and `T` is at the end (or vice-versa) and `k` is larger than `n`, this could lead to unexpected behavior since the modulo logic suggests wrapping around.
- The case where `k` is larger than the distance between `G` and `T` could also lead to incorrect results if the path is blocked.

### Output Hints Confirmation:
The output hints state:
- The function correctly identifies whether it's possible to jump to `T` from `G` while checking for obstacles.
- It mentions conditions related to the distances and obstacles, which are consistent with what the code does.

### Conclusion:
Upon examining the code, it seems to handle the basic requirements as stated in the problem description. However, the potential issue with jumping over obstacles using circular indexing could lead to times when the grasshopper is unable to correctly identify if it can reach `T` due to obstacles, especially in edge cases where the path is not linear.

Therefore, I believe the program does not consider all edge cases adequately, which leads to it being incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
5 3
G...T
```
Here, the grasshopper at position `0` can jump `3` positions directly to `T` at position `4`. The program would print "YES", which is correct. However, if there was an obstacle in between, e.g.,:
```
6 3
G.#..T
```
The program incorrectly returns "YES" since it is checking the modulo condition but doesn't account for the obstacle correctly. It should return "NO" because the grasshopper cannot jump over obstacles.
