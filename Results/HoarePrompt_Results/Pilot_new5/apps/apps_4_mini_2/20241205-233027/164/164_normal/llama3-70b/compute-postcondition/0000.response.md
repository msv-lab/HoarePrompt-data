The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user and splits it into two parts which are then converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. 

The impact of the code is that both `n` and `k` will now hold specific integer values based on user input, but their exact values are not known from the initial state.

Therefore, the output state, which reflects that `n` and `k` have been assigned values from user input while keeping the conditions specified in the initial state, is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, assigned values from input.**
