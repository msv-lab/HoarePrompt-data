Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, and `t` is an integer. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is set to 0. The character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G'.***
