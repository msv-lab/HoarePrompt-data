The line of code assigns the value of `max_erase` to the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. The values of `j` and `i` are known: `j` is 5 and `i` is 2. Therefore, we can calculate `j - i - 1` as follows:

- Calculate `j - i - 1`: 
  - `5 - 2 - 1 = 2`

Since `max_erase` is compared to this value, we don't have a specific value for `max_erase` in the initial state. The outcome will depend on the prior value of `max_erase`, which is unknown. Thus, it could either stay the same or be updated to 2, but we can't determine exactly what it becomes.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_erase` may take either its previous value or 2, depending on which is larger, but since we do not have the previous state of `max_erase`, we cannot assign a specific value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 5 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.**
