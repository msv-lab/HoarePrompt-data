Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is either 0 or `j - 1`, and `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`. If all elements in `a` from index `i` to `j-1` satisfy the condition that `a[k] - a[i] == k - i`, then `max_erase` is updated to `j - 1`; otherwise, no else part is executed.***
