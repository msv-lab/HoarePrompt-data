According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer in the provided state, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take on values from `0` to `n-1`. Since `n` is positive, `i` will start at `0`.

The variable `max_erase` does not influence the execution of the loop itself; it is initialized to `0`, which is acceptable and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to summarize the states needed before the loop starts: `i` should be initialized to `0`, and `n` is already a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is 0**
