The variable `j` is currently equal to `n + 1`, and `i` is equal to `1`. The expression `j - i - 1` simplifies to `(n + 1) - 1 - 1`, which further simplifies to `n - 1`. 

Assuming `max_erase` initially holds some value (as it is not defined in the initial state), the code assigns the maximum of the previous `max_erase` value and `n - 1` to `max_erase`. The state of `n`, `i`, and `j` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `max_erase` is updated to max(`max_erase`, `n - 1`)**.
