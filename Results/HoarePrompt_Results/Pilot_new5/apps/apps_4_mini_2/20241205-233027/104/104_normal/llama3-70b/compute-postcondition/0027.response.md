According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `max_erase` is the maximum number of elements that can be erased based on the conditions checked for all j in the range.**
