To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to check whether it meets the specified requirements from the problem description. The program aims to find the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from a strictly increasing array while ensuring that the remaining elements allow for the original array to be restored.

The provided program implementation is as follows:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
    print(max_erase)
```

**Understanding the Code:**
1. The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the array.
2. It reads the array `a` which consists of `n` strictly increasing integers.
3. It initializes `max_erase` to zero, which will hold the maximum number of erasures possible.
4. It uses nested loops to evaluate all possible subarrays defined by indices `i` and `j`.
5. The inner `all` condition checks whether the elements in the subarray from `i` to `j` can be erased while still allowing the sequence to be restored based on the remaining elements.
6. If the condition holds true, it updates `max_erase` with the maximum number of elements that can be erased.

**Potential Issues:**
- The program assumes that the consecutive elements between indices `i` and `j` can always be erased as long as the condition is met. However, it does not properly account for the case where erasing elements would lead to invalid gaps that cannot be filled by the remaining numbers.
  
Let's consider some edge cases:
1. **Case with minimum input:**
   Input:
   ```
   1
   1
   ```
   Expected output: `0` (since there are no elements to erase).
   Actual output: `0` (this case is handled correctly).

2. **Case with elements that cannot be erased:**
   Input:
   ```
   2
   1 2
   ```
   Expected output: `0` (cannot erase anything).
   Actual output: `0` (this case is handled correctly).

3. **Case with maximum consecutive elements that can be erased:**
   Input:
   ```
   5
   1 2 3 4 5
   ```
   Expected output: `4` (you can erase all but one).
   Actual output: `4` (this case is handled correctly).

4. **Edge Case with large gaps:**
   Input:
   ```
   5
   1 3 4 6 7
   ```
   Expected output: `2` (you can erase `3` and `4` but leave `1` and `6`).
   However, the program might miscalculate the maximum consecutive erasures because it checks only based on the current values and not on the overall constraints.

Given the potential oversight regarding the restoration condition, particularly when the erased elements create larger than necessary gaps, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not account for all potential scenarios, especially those involving non-consecutive elements that could create invalid states for restoration. For instance, if we consider an input like `[1, 3, 4, 6, 7]`, the program may not provide the correct maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased since its logic is predicated on the assumption that only gaps defined strictly by the indices can be managed, ignoring the overall structure of the array.
