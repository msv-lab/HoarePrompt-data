To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze how it responds to the specified problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program is supposed to calculate how many spectators are standing at a given time `t` based on the rules of the Mexican wave. The spectators start standing one by one until `k` spectators are standing, then they start sitting as the next ones stand.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is structured as follows:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - For times `t` from `1` to `n`, the number of standing spectators is simply `t` or `k`, whichever is smaller. This holds because up to the `k-th` moment, each spectator stands one by one.
   - For times `t` greater than `n`, the standing number is calculated using: `k - (t - n) % k`. This is intended to reflect the sitting of spectators after all `n` have stood.

2. **Boundary Cases**:
   - At `t = 1`, output should be `1`.
   - At `t = k`, output should be `k`.
   - At `t = n`, output should still be `k`.
   - At `t = n + 1`, the first spectator sits, so output should be `k - 1`.
   - This continues until `t = n + k`, where all spectators are seated, so the output should be `0`.

### Test Cases:
- **Example 1**: `n = 10, k = 5, t = 3`
  - Expected output: `3`
  - Program output: `min(3, 5) = 3` → Correct.
  
- **Example 2**: `n = 10, k = 5, t = 7`
  - Expected output: `5`
  - Program output: `5` (since `t > n` results in `k - (7 - 10) % 5 = 5`) → Correct.
  
- **Example 3**: `n = 10, k = 5, t = 12`
  - Expected output: `3`
  - Program output: `5 - (12 - 10) % 5 = 3` → Correct.

### Potential Cases:
1. Let's check if the program fails with other inputs:
   - For `n = 10, k = 5, t = 11`:
     - Expected: `4` (since one person sits)
     - Program: `5 - (11 - 10) % 5 = 4` → Correct.
   - For `n = 10, k = 5, t = 15`:
     - Expected: `0` (all seated)
     - Program: `5 - (15 - 10) % 5 = 0` → Correct.

### Conclusion:
After examining the logic and testing various cases, the program correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement. It handles all boundary conditions appropriately and produces the expected results for a wide range of inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
