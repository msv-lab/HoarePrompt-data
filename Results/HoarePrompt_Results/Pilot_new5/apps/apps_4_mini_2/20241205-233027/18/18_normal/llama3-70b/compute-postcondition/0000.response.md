The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned new integer values based on user input. Since `n`, `k`, and `t` had specific integer values satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, after the execution, they will now represent the new integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers assigned new values from user input.**
