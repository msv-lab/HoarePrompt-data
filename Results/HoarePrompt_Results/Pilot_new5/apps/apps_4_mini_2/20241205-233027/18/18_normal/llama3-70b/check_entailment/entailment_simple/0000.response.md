To determine the correctness of the given annotated program based on the problem description, we must analyze what the program does and whether it accurately counts the number of spectators standing at a specified time `t`.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. There are `n` spectators, and the wave starts at time `0`.
2. At time `1` to `k`, each spectator from `1` to `k` stands up.
3. At time `k+1`, the `k+1`-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits down.
4. This pattern continues until `n`, where the `n-th` spectator stands and the `(n-k)`-th spectator sits down.
5. After time `n`, spectators start sitting down, with the last standing spectators sitting at times `n+1` to `n+k`.

### Program Logic:
The function reads `n`, `k`, and `t`, and calculates the number of spectators standing:
- If `t <= n`: The function returns `min(t, k)`, meaning it counts how many spectators are standing based solely on `t`, ensuring it does not exceed `k` (the maximum number of spectators standing).
- If `t > n`: The function calculates how many spectators are still standing by considering the cyclical nature of the seating and standing process, using the formula `k - (t - n) % k`. This represents the spectators sitting down after time `n`.

### Analysis of Correctness:
1. For `t` in the range `[1, k]`:
   - The number of standing spectators is simply `t`, and since it does not exceed `k`, `min(t, k)` is correct.
  
2. For `t` in the range `[k+1, n]`:
   - Here, `k` spectators are standing, and the function correctly returns `k`.

3. For `t` in the range `[n+1, n+k]`:
   - Here, the formula `k - (t - n) % k` calculates the number of spectators sitting down based on how much time has passed since `n`. This captures the correct transition of spectators from standing to sitting as `t` increases.

The program effectively handles all edge cases described in the problem statement. 

### Conclusion:
The program accurately follows the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs. Thus, it can be concluded that the program meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
