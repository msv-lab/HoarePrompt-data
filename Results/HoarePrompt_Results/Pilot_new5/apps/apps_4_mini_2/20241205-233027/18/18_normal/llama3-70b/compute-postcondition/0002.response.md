The function `func` does not take any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers, with the following relationships: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and \(1 \leq t < n + k\). 

Since there are no explicit return cases provided in the prompt, we need to describe the function's behavior based on the input constraints. The functionality of the function will be inferred from the accepted constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts constraints on integers n, k, and t where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, and it processes these integers according to its internal logic.**
