To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program in relation to the behavior of the Mexican wave at different times.

### Breakdown of the Problem Description:
1. **At time `1` to `k`:** The first `k` spectators stand up sequentially, so the number of standing spectators increases from `1` to `k`.
2. **At time `k + 1` to `n`:** Each subsequent spectator stands while the first `k` spectators remain standing until `n`, meaning the count remains at `k` (the maximum).
3. **At time `n + 1` to `n + k`:** The spectators begin to sit down, reducing the count of standing spectators back to `0`.

### Analysis of the Program Logic:
The function computes the number of standing spectators based on the input time `t`:

1. **If `t <= n`:** The number of standing spectators is simply the minimum of `t` and `k`, which aligns with the behavior described since at time `t`, the spectators who would stand up would just be `t` (if less than `k`), or `k` (if `t` equals or exceeds `k`).
   
   - For example:
     - For `t = 3` and `k = 5`, it would print `3`, which is correct.
     - For `t = 7` and `k = 5`, it would print `5`, which is also correct.

2. **If `t > n`:** The program computes `k - (t - n) % k`. This expression captures the process of how many spectators are still standing after the maximum standing count has been reached and some spectators start sitting down. 
   - The term `(t - n) % k` effectively gives the number of spectators that have sat down, cycling through the `k` spectators who were standing at time `n`.

   - For example:
     - For `t = 12`, when `n = 10` and `k = 5`, it computes `5 - (12 - 10) % 5 = 5 - 2 = 3`, which is correct as there would be `3` spectators standing at that time.
     - This logic holds for all excess times.

### Conclusion:
The function accurately computes the number of standing spectators for all input cases defined in the problem description. The conditions it checks and the calculations it performs match the expected behavior of the Mexican wave. 

Thus, the provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
