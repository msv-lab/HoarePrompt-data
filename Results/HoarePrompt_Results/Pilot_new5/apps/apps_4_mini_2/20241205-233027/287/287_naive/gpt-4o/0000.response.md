Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of the integer \( n \), but the function `func_1` is instead calculating the number of divisors of \( n \). 

For example, if we consider \( n = 7 \):
- The valid splits and their weights would be:
  - Weight 1: [7]
  - Weight 2: [3, 3, 1]
  - Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1]
  - Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  
This gives us 4 different weights.

However, the function incorrectly counts the number of divisors instead of the weights based on the splits, which does not address the problem statement accurately at all. Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
