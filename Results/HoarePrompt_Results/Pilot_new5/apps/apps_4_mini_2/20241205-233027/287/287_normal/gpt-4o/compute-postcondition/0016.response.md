According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num`. The loop condition is `i * i <= num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `num` is at least 4. The expression `i * i` evaluates to 9 when `i` is 3, which means the loop will not execute again because 9 is not less than or equal to 4. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted. Since we want `i * i` to be less than or equal to `num`, and knowing that the current value of `i` is 3, we can set `i` to 2. This way, `2 * 2` equals 4, which satisfies the loop condition if `num` is 4.

State: **`num` is at least 4, `count` is 0, `i` must be 2**
