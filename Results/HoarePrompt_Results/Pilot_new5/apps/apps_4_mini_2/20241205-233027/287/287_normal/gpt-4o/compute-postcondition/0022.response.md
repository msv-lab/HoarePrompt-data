To determine the output state after the loop has executed, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop given the initial state and how the variables change during the iterations.

1. The loop continues as long as \( i * i \) is less than or equal to \( num \). 
2. Inside the loop, if \( num \mod i == 0 \) (meaning \( i \) is a divisor of \( num \)), we increase the `count` by 1. If \( i \) is not equal to \( num // i \) (which checks for perfect squares), we increase the `count` again.
3. After processing the conditions, \( i \) is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Based on this analysis, after checking all possible divisors, the following can be concluded about the state of the variables:

- The loop will execute while \( i \) is less than or equal to \( \sqrt{num} \). 
- Once \( i \) exceeds \( \sqrt{num} \), the loop terminates.
- The value of `count` will reflect the total number of divisors of the original `num`.
- After the loop finishes, \( i \) will be equal to \( \lfloor \sqrt{num} \rfloor + 1 \) because the last valid value of \( i \) that satisfied \( i * i \leq num \) would be \( \lfloor \sqrt{num} \rfloor \).

Thus, after the loop has executed:

Output State: **`i` is \( \lfloor \sqrt{num} \rfloor + 1 \), `count` is the number of divisors of the original value of `num`.**
