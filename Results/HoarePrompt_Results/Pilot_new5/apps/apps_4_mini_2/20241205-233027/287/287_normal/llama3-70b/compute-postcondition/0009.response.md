According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to the integer value of the square root of `n`, inclusive. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). The current value of `i` is such that \( i \times i \) is either equal to or not equal to `n`. If \( i \times i = n \), then `res` is set to 1 and `i` is 1 if `n` is divisible by `i`. If \( i \times i \neq n \), `res` remains unchanged.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be \( i + 1 \). For the loop to execute again, \( i + 1 \) must be less than or equal to \( int(n ** 0.5) \). 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- The new value of `i` will be \( i + 1 \).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and `res` remains unchanged**.
