`res` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and `n` is divisible by `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and `n` is divisible by `i`.**
