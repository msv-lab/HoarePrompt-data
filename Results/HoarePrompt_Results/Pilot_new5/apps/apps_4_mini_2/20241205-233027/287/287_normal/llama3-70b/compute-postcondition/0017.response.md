The value of `res` is decremented by 1, affecting its current state. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not impacted by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `i` is unchanged; `res` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `i` is unchanged; `res` is decremented by 1.**
