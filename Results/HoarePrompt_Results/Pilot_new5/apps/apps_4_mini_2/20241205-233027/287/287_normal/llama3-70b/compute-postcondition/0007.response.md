`res` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `res` is 2, so after this operation, `res` becomes 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `res` is 1, and `i` is 1 if `n` is divisible by `i`; otherwise, `res` is 0. The current value of `i` satisfies `i * i == n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `res` is 1, and `i` is 1 if `n` is divisible by `i`; otherwise, `res` is 0. The current value of `i` satisfies `i * i == n.**
