The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so after the execution, the new value of `count` is 2. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is at least 4, `count` is 2, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`num` is at least 4, `count` is 2, `i` is 2**
