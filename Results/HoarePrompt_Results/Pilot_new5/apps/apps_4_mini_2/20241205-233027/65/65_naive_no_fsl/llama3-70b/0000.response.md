Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more friends than the number of unique colors of balloons. For example, consider the following input:

```
4 3
aabb
```

In this case, there are 4 balloons (2 of color 'a' and 2 of color 'b') and 3 friends. The program would output "YES" because the maximum count of any color (which is 2) is less than or equal to the number of friends (which is 3). 

However, it is impossible to distribute the balloons without making at least one friend upset, as there would be only 2 unique colors and one friend would end up receiving 2 balloons of the same color. 

Therefore, the program fails to account for the condition that no friend should receive two balloons of the same color, and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
