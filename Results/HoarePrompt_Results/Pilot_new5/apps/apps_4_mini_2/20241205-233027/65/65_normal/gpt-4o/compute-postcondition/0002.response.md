The code initializes `color_count` as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this action. Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the change made to `color_count`, while other variables retain their original information.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of balloons (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer representing the number of friends (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet, `color_count` is an empty dictionary.**
