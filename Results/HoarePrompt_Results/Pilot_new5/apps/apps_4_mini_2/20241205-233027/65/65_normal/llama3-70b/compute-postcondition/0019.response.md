Postcondition: ***`color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the string `s`, and each value is the count of occurrences of that color in `s`; `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a positive integer; `max_color_count` is the maximum value from the counts in `color_count`, or an error is raised if `color_count` is empty. The current value of `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`.***
