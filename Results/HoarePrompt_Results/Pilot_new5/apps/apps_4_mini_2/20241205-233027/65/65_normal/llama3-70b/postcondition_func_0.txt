The function accepts two positive integers `n` (the number of balloons) and `k` (the number of friends), along with a string `s` representing the colors of the balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color in `s`. If the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to `k`, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. It does not return any values or perform additional operations such as returning a concatenation of colors.
