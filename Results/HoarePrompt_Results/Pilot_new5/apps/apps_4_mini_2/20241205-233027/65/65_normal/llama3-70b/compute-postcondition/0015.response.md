The variable `color_count[c]` is assigned the value `1`. The character `c` is at index `i` of the string `s`, and `i` is guaranteed to be less than `n` where `n` is a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the character at index `i`, `i` is less than `n`, and `color_count[c]` is 1.**
