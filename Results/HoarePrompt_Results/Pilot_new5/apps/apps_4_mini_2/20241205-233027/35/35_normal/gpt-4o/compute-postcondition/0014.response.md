The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. Since `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, it will be updated to this new value based on the current values of `low` and `high`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` is less than `high`, `high` is unchanged, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
