The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. The parameter `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, constrained by 1 ≤ a ≤ 100. The parameter `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, constrained by 1 ≤ b ≤ 100. 

Based on the output description, the function calculates a value `low` equal to the last value of `high` or `min(a, b) + 2`, where `high` is defined as `min(a, b) + 1` or less. The program ultimately returns `low - 1`, which is at least `min(a, b)` or less.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `a` representing pieces of the first cake, and an integer `b` representing pieces of the second cake. It returns `low - 1`, where `low` is calculated based on the pieces of the cakes, ensuring the returned value is at least `min(a, b)` or less.**
