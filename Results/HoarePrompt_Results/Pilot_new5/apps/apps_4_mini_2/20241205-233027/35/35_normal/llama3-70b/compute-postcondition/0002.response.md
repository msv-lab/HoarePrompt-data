Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely regardless of the conditions of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the states in order for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
