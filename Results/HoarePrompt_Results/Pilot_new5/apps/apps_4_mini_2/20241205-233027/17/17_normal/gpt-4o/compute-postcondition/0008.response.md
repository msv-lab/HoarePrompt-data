Postcondition: ***`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1` is a non-negative integer input; `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` are input integers. If `cnt1 + cnt2` equals `cnt3 + cnt4` and `cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt3`, the value 1 has been printed. Otherwise, if either condition is not met, the printed output is 0.***
