The code snippet `print(0)` outputs the integer `0`, but it does not change the values of any variables in the program. The initial state of the variables remains valid, and no new values are assigned. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged status of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1` is a non-negative integer input; `cnt2` is an input integer; `cnt3` is an input integer; `cnt4` is an input integer; it is not the case that `cnt1 + cnt2` equals `cnt3 + cnt4`, or `cnt2` is less than `cnt3`. Printed output is 0.**
