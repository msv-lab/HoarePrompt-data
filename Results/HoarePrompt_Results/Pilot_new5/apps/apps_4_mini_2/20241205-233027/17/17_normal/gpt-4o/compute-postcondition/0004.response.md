Postcondition: ***`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1` is a non-negative integer input; `cnt2` is an input integer; `cnt3` is an input integer; `cnt4` is an input integer. The current values of `cnt1` and `cnt2` satisfy the equation `cnt1 + cnt2 = cnt3 + cnt4`, and the current value of `cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt3`.***
