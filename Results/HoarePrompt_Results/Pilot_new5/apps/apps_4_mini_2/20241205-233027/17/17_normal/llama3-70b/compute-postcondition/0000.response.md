The variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are assigned values based on input. Each of these variables can take a non-negative integer value, with the constraint that each can range from 0 to 10^9. The code uses `map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])` to read four lines of input, convert them to integers, and assign them to `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`.

After executing the code, `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` will now hold the integer values that were inputted by the user.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is an input integer**.
