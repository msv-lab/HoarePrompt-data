The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element at `pixels[i][j]`. The variable `i` is currently 0 and `j` is 1, so the specific element being changed is `pixels[0][1]`. The other variables remain unaffected in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `pixels[0][1]` is '.'**
