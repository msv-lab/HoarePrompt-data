Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', and `j` is `k + 2`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to the value of `j`. If `j` is not greater than `right`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
