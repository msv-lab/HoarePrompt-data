The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` to be the minimum of their current values and the values from the tuple `(x, y)` that is the first entry in `white_pixels`. The initial state mentions that `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, so the values for `x` and `y` are valid.

Since `min_x` and `min_y` are being updated, the output state will show their new values along with the other information that remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` contains at least 1 entry of tuples, `(x, y)` is the first tuple from `white_pixels`, `min_x` is now min(min_x, x), `min_y` is now min(min_y, y)**
