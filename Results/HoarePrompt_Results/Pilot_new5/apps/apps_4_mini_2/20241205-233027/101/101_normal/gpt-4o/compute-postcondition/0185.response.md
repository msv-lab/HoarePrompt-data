Postcondition: ***`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 1`, `j` is `left + 2`. If `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or if `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, and if `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][j]` is updated to '+'.***
