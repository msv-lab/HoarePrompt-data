Postcondition: ***`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `j` is `left + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`. If `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`, and if `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][j]` is set to '+'.***
