Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `pixels[2][0]` is '.', then `pixels[2][0]` is set to '+'. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w', it is '.' and remains unchanged.***
