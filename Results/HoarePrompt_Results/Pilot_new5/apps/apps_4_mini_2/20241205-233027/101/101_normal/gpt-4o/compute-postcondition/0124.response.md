Postcondition: ***`top`, `bottom` are 1, `left`, `right` are indices related to the presence of 'w', `i` is 1, and `j` is updated to `j + 1` if `i` is greater than `bottom`. If `i` is not greater than `bottom`, the function continues with `i` being 1 and `j` incremented, maintaining the relation between these variables.***
