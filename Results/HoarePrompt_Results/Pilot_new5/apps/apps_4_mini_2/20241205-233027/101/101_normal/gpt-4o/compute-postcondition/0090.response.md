The code assigns the value of `j` to `left`. The variable `j` is defined as `k + 2`, where `k < m - 2`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `right`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged except for `left`, which is now equal to `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 2`, `left` is `j`, `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain unchanged.**
