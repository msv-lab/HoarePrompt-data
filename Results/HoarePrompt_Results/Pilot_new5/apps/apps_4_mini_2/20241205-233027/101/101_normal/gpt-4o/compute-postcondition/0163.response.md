The statement `result[i][j] = '+'` assigns the character `'+'` to the specified position `result[i][j]` in a two-dimensional list or array named `result`. The variables `top`, `bottom`, `j`, `left`, and `right` are not directly affected by this assignment, and their previous values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `j` is `left + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `result[i][j]` is '+'**
