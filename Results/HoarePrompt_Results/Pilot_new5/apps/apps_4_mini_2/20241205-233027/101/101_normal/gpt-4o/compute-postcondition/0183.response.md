The variable `result[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. The values of `i` and `j` are determined by the expressions `top + 1` and `left + 2`, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 1`, `j` is `left + 2`, and `result[i][j]` is '+'.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 1`, `j` is `left + 2`, and `result[i][j]` is '+'**.
