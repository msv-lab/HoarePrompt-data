Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` must be greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` remains 0, `left` remains 0, `right` is updated to the value of `j` if `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`, `i` remains 0, and `j` is 1. If `i` is less than `top`, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
