Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is updated to the value of `j` if `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`. If `j` is not greater than `right`, there are no changes to the state.***
