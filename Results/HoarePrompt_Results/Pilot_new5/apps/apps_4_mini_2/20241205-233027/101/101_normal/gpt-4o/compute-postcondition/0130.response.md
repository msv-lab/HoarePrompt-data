Postcondition: ***`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` are defined. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top` is set to 1, `bottom` is set to 1, `left` and `right` are both set to `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `top` is defined, then `top` remains 1, `bottom` remains 1, `left` is set to `j`, `right` is set to `j`, and `i` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `right`, the variables remain unchanged; if `j` is less than `left`, then `j` remains unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', no changes are made to the variables.***
