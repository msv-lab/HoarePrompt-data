The variable `frame_height` is assigned the value of `bottom - top + 1`. The variables `top` and `bottom` are not specified in the initial state, but they are defined as the minimum and maximum row indices containing 'w', respectively. Therefore, `frame_height` is calculated as the difference between `bottom` and `top`, incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`.**
