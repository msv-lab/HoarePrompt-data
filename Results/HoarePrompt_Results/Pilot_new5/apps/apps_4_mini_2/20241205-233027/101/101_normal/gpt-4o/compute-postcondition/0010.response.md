Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the character at position `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If the current value of `i` is less than `top` (0), then `i` remains less than 0. There is no else part to consider.***
