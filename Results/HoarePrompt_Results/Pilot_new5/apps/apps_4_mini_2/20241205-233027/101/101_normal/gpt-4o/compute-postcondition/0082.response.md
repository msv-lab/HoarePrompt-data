Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', and `j` is `k + 1` (where `k < m - 1`). If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `i`. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`, while `top`, `bottom`, and `left` remain unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', the state remains unchanged.***
