According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1, indicating that it can execute one more time. For the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
