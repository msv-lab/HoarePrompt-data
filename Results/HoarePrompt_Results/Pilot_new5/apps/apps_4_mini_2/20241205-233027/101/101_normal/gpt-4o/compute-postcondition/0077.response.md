The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` depends on the value of `k`, which is less than `m - 1`. Therefore, `j` can be expressed as `k + 1`, and since `k` is less than `m - 1`, `j` must be at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 1` (where `k < m - 1`), `top` and `bottom` remain unchanged, and `left` is equal to `j`.
