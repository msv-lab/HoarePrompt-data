To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements of the task and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Input**: A grid with pixels represented by 'w' (white pixel) and '.' (black pixel). At least one 'w' is guaranteed.
2. **Output**: A square frame should be drawn around the outermost 'w' pixels. The frame must:
   - Be one pixel wide.
   - Enclose all 'w' pixels.
   - Not go beyond the borders of the screen.
3. **Conditions**: If the determined frame's dimensions are less than 2 (either height or width), the output should be -1.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads the grid dimensions and the state of the pixels.
2. It identifies the minimum and maximum indices for rows and columns that contain 'w' pixels (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`).
3. If `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` are None (i.e., if no 'w' was found), it should return -1, but this condition is guaranteed not to occur due to the problem constraints.
4. It calculates the frame's height and width. If either is less than 2, it returns -1.
5. It creates a result grid by copying the original screen and then modifying the edges defined by the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` indices to replace appropriate positions with '+' where the original was '.'.
6. Finally, it returns the modified grid.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- **Minimum Frame Size Check**: The condition checking if `frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2` is crucial because if the frame cannot be drawn properly (i.e., if all 'w's are in a single row or column), it needs to return -1.
- **Placement of Frame**: The frame is only added to positions where originally there were '.' and at the edges defined by the 'w' pixel bounds. This ensures that the white pixels are preserved while creating the frame.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. If all 'w' pixels are at the corners or aligned in a single row or column, the program must return -1 as the frame cannot be created around them.
2. The program should also handle cases where 'w' pixels are surrounded by '.' pixels in a larger area.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in the program correctly follows the problem description requirements, as it effectively finds the bounding coordinates of the 'w' pixels and accurately creates a frame while managing edge cases by returning -1 when necessary.

Therefore, the provided program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
