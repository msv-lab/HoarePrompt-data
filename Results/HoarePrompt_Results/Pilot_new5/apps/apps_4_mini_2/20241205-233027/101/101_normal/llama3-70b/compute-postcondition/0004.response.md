According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `white_pixels`. The loop will execute if there is at least one entry in the `white_pixels` list. To ensure the loop can run, we need to check the state of `white_pixels`. Given that `n` is between 1 and 2000, it implies that `pixels` can be populated with various characters (including 'w'), but we specifically need to focus on the formation of `white_pixels`.

For the loop to execute, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, which means there should be at least one 'w' in the `pixels` list. Additionally, during the first iteration, `(x, y)` will represent the first entry in `white_pixels`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `white_pixels` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` must contain at least 1 entry of tuples, `(x, y)` is the first tuple from `white_pixels`**
