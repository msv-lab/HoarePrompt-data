Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen`. It calculates the minimum and maximum indices of 'w' characters in the `screen`. If no 'w' characters are found or if the resulting rectangle formed by these indices is less than 2 in height or width, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns a modified version of `screen`, replacing the border positions of the rectangle defined by the 'w' characters with '+' while leaving the interior unchanged. **
