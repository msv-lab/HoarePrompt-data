The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The variable `bottom` also receives the same value of `i`, which means `bottom` will also be set to 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `left`, `right`, and the values in `screen` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the value at `screen[1][j]` is 'w'.**
