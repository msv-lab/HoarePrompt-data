Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, for each column `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `pixels[2][j]` is either '+' (if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[2][j]` was originally '.'), remains 'w' (if it was originally 'w'), or is set to '.' (if it was neither '+' nor 'w' originally).**
