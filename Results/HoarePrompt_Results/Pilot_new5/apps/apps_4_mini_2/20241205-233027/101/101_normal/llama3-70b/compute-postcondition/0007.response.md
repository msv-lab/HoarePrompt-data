According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `white_pixels` list. If `white_pixels` has more entries, the loop can continue executing. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` contains at least one entry, and `(x, y)` is the first tuple from `white_pixels`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `white_pixels` must contain at least 2 entries, and `(x, y)` must be updated to the next tuple in the list. Since `white_pixels` had at least 1 entry previously, we can infer that the next tuple will be taken from the second entry of the list.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` contains at least 2 entries of tuples, `(x, y)` is the second tuple from `white_pixels`, `min_x` is now min(min_x, x), `min_y` is now min(min_y, y), `max_x` is now max(max_x, x), `max_y` is now max(max_y, y)**
