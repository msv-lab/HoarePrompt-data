The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `j` is currently 0, both `left` and `right` will be updated to 0. The previous values of `left` and `right` are not known, but they are now both equal to the current value of `j`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
