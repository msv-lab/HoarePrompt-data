Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and then reads `n` lines of pixel data consisting of characters '.' and 'w'. It identifies the minimum and maximum coordinates of the 'w' pixels, calculates the frame size, and checks if it exceeds the dimensions of the pixel grid. If the frame size is larger than the maximum of `n` and `m`, it prints -1. Otherwise, it modifies the border pixels that are '.' to '+', keeps the 'w' pixels unchanged, and converts all other pixels to '.'. Finally, it prints the modified pixel grid. The function does not return a value; it only prints the result.**
