According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `m`. Given that `j` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains 2, and `j` is 0. After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, becoming 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` remains 2, and `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1**
