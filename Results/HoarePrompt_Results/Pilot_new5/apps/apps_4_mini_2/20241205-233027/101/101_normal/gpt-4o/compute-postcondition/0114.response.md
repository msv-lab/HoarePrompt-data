The assignment `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to `right`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', but now it is updated to the current value of `j`. Since `j` is less than `left` and greater than `right`, it implies that `j` is a specific column index, making `right` now equal to this index. 

Output State: **`top` is equal to 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than `bottom` and remains equal to 1 if it is less than `top`, the value at `screen[1][j]` is 'w', the current value of `j` is less than `left`, and the current value of `j` is greater than `right`.**
