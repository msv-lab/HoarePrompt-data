Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` contains all tuples of coordinates for each pixel equal to 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all white pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all white pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all white pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all white pixels, and `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. The current value of `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`.***
