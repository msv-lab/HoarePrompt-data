The code assigns to `max_x` and `max_y` the maximum values between their current values and the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. Given that `max_x` and `max_y` were already updated to their respective maximum values before this code snippet is executed, their new values will reflect the maximum between their current values and those of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the output state remains valid for all other variables, but updates `max_x` and `max_y` based on the tuple values `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` contains at least 3 entries of tuples, `(x, y)` is the third tuple from `white_pixels`, `min_x` is now min(min_x, x), `min_y` is now min(min_y, y), `max_x` is now max(max_x, x), `max_y` is now max(max_y, y)**.
