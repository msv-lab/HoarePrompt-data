Postcondition: ***`top` is 1 or None, `bottom` is 1, `left` is set to `j`, and `right` is set to `j` if `top` is 1; otherwise, `right` is set to `j + 1`. `i` is 1, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `left` is updated to `j` and `right` becomes equal to `j`. If `j` is not greater than `right`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain as described.***
