Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Frame Size Calculation**: The program calculates the frame size using `frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. This calculation is incorrect for determining the minimum square frame that surrounds all 'w' pixels. The correct formula should be based on the width and height of the bounding box created by the 'w' pixels. The frame needs to be at least `max_x - min_x + 1` and `max_y - min_y + 1`, and then you would take the maximum of these two values. This is essential because the frame should encompass all white pixels.

2. **Check for Frame Validity**: The condition `if (frame_size > max(n, m))` does not cover the scenario where a frame could still be valid but not fit in one of the dimensions. If the calculated frame size is larger than the available dimensions, it simply prints `-1`, which may not be the correct output for certain arrangements of 'w' pixels.

3. **Frame Placement**: The nested loop that modifies the `pixels` list looks for border pixels and changes them to '+' if they are currently '.'; however, it does not properly account for the situation where the frame might be formed by 'w' pixels. If 'w' pixels are located at the corners or edges, the frame should not overwrite them.

4. **Output Representation**: While the program attempts to print the modified pixel grid, it does not guarantee that the printed grid has the correct frame representation around all 'w' pixels, particularly if those pixels do not adhere to the expected conditions of a frame.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle the case where a valid frame cannot be formed, such as when 'w' pixels are isolated, or when they are positioned in such a way that they cannot form a complete square frame because of surrounding black pixels.

Due to these issues, the program may not produce the correct output for various inputs, particularly for edge cases where the placement of 'w' pixels is not conducive to forming a proper frame. This explicitly violates the requirements set forth in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
