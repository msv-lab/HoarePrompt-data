The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. The value of `i` is 0, so `bottom` becomes 0. Since both `bottom` and `i` were already 0 before the assignment, their values remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` must be greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` remains 0, `left` remains 0, `right` is updated to the value of `j` if `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`, `i` remains 0, and `j` is 1.**
