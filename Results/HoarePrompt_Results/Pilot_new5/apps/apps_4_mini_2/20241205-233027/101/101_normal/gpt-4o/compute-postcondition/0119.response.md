After executing the code `top = bottom = i`, both `top` and `bottom` are assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The other variables (`left`, `right`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `top` and `bottom`.

Output State: **`top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1` (must be less than m)**
