To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we analyze the given state and the for loop's structure.

In this case, the loop structure is:
```
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The execution of the loop depends on the value of `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000 (which does not influence the execution of the loop directly).
- `i` is 0 (the initial value of `i` does not affect the loop either).

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 1. The variable `j` will take on values starting from 0 up to `m-1` during the loop iterations.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the stated variables are:

1. `m` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
2. At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
