According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `left` and `right`. For the loop to execute, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. The state variables `top`, `bottom`, `i`, and `j` do not directly affect the ability of the loop to run, except for determining valid indices. The values of `j` will start from `left` and will include `right` in the range, provided that `left` is indeed less than or equal to `right`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the following conditions need to be satisfied:
1. `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
2. `j` will start at `left`.

State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 1`, `j` is `left`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`**
