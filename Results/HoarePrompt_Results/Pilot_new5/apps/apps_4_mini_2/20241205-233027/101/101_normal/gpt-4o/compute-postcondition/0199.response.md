The variable `result[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. The specific values of `i` and `j` need to be determined based on the initial state where `i` is `top + 2` and `j` is `left + 2`. The values of `top` and `left` are unspecified but valid based on the initial state. Other variables `bottom` and `right` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 2`, `j` is `left + 2`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `result[i][j]` is '+'**
