Postcondition: ***`top` is equal to 1; `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w'; `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w'; `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w'; `n` is greater than 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 1 and it is now greater than `bottom`. The value at `screen[1][j]` is 'w'; if `i` is less than `top`, then `i` remains equal to 1.***
