The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 100, and `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the specific logic defined within its body. However, the output details are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described without knowing the specific return values or cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'.**
