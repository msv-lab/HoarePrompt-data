The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `s` consisting of `n` characters that are either '+' or '-'. It calculates the net number of "stones" based on the operations defined in the string, where each '+' increases the number of stones by 1 and each '-' decreases it by 1, ensuring that the number of stones never goes below 0. Finally, it prints the resulting number of stones.
