The `minus_count` variable is assigned the value representing the number of occurrences of the character '-' in the string `s`. Given that `s` consists of characters '+' and '-', the value of `minus_count` will depend on how many '-' characters are present in `s`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it is an input positive integer representing the length of the string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s**.
