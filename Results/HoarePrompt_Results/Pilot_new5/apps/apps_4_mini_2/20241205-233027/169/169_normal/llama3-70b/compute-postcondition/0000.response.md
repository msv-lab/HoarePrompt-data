The code assigns a new value to `n` based on the input provided by the user, which should still be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100. The state of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `n` as an input integer while keeping the original conditions of `s` intact.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length n consisting of the characters '+' and '-'**
