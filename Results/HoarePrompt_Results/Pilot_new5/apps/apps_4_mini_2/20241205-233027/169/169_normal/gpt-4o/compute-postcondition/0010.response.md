Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`. If the first character of `s` (operation) is '+', then `stones` is set to 1. Otherwise, `stones` is set to 0, and `operation` is the first character of `s` that is not equal to '+'. If `operation` is '-', the program will proceed under this condition.***
