The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of the characters '+' and '-'. It counts the occurrences of '-' and '+' in the string. If the count of '-' exceeds that of '+', it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.
