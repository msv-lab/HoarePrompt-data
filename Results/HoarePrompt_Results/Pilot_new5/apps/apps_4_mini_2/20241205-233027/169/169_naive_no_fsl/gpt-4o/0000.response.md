Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after performing the operations. It assumes that the pile starts with 0 stones and then adjusts based on the operations. 

However, the problem states that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. This means that it is possible (and necessary) to ensure that the initial number of stones is sufficient to handle all the "-" operations in the sequence.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-++
```
In this case, Vasya takes a stone first (which is not allowed if he starts with 0 stones). The correct behavior would require that Vasya starts with at least 1 stone to perform the first operation. The expected output in this case should be 1, as you would need at least 1 stone to begin with to handle the first "-" operation, followed by the two "+" operations which would add 2 stones.

The program incorrectly allows the number of stones to go to 0 without considering the restriction imposed by the first "-" operation, thus failing to meet the problem's requirements in all cases. Therefore, the function does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is not correct.
