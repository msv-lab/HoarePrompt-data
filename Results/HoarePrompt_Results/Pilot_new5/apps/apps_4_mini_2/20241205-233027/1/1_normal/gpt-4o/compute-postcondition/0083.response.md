Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is -1 or a valid index, and `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' or -1 if ']' is not present in `s`. If `ind` is -1, `bind` is -1, or `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, if `ind` is a valid index and `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, then if `start_colon` is -1, `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, the output is -1; otherwise, `end_colon` is at least `start_colon + 2`, `pipe_count` is 0, `i` is equal to `end_colon`, `result` is 4, and the value 4 has been printed.***
