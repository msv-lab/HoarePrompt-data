The variable `start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state specifies that `i` is equal to `ind + 1`. Since `ind` is not equal to -1, `i` will be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `i` is `ind + 1`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' or -1 if ']' is not present in `s`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` is equal to `i`.**
