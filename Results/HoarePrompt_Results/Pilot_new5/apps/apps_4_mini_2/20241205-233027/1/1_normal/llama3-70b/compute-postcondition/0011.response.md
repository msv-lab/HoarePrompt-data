The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n`; `i` is 0; `ind` is 0; `f` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
