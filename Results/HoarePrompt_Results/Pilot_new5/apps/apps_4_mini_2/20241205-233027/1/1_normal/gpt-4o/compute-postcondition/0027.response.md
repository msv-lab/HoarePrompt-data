According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to the range specified. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

Since `i` is currently `n - 2`, in the next iteration, it will be `n - 3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n - 3`, and it will continue to execute as long as `i` remains greater than or equal to `0`.

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is -1 or a valid index, `i` is `n - 3`**
