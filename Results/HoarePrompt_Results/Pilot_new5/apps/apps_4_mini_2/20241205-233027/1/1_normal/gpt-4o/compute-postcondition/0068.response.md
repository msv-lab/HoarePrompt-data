The variable `pipe_count` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `end_colon` is either the index of the first colon (`:`) found in the range from `bind - 1` down to `ind + 1`, or remains -1 if no colon is found, `i` is `ind + 1`, and `pipe_count` is 0.
