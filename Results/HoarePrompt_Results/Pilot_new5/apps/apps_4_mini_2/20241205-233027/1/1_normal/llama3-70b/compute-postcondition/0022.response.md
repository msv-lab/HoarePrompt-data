According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented due to the conditions specified (`s[i]` being either '[' or ':'). 

If `s[i]` was '[', `f` remains True, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ind` remains 0. So in this case, `i` becomes `i + 1`. If `s[i]` was not '[' and was ':', then `f` becomes True, `i` is incremented, `ind` is set to the new value of `i`, and the program breaks out of the loop.

In both scenarios, `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. This means that the new value of `i` should be `i + 1`, and we need to ensure that `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 1), `f` remains True, `i` is `i + 1`, `ind` remains 0**
