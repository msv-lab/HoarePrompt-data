Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 0). If `s[0]` is '[', `f` is set to True; otherwise, if `s[0]` is ':', then `i` remains 0, `ind` is 0, and `f` is also set to True, indicating that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
