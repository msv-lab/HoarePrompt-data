The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `i` is not provided. Therefore, `ind` will take on this new value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 0), `f` is set to True, `i` is the new value (incremented by 1), `ind` is now equal to `i`.**
