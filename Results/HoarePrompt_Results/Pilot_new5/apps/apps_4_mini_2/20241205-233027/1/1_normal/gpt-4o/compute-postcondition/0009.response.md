`ind` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is 1, so `ind` becomes 1. The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1**.
