Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 0). If `f` is True, then `i` is incremented by 1, `ind` is set to the new value of `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
