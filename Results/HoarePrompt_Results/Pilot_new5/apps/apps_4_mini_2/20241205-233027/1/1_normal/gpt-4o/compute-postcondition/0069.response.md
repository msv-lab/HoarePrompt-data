To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions surrounding the loop.

1. The loop iterates from `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon`, meaning that `end_colon` must be greater than `start_colon + 1` for the loop to have any iterations. Therefore, `end_colon` should be at least `start_colon + 2`.

2. Additionally, since `i` starts at `ind + 1`, `ind` must be less than `end_colon - 1` for `i` to be less than `end_colon` during the first iteration of the loop.

3. We need to ensure that `start_colon` is defined and that `end_colon` is a valid index within the range specified.

In summary, for the loop to execute:
- `end_colon` must be greater than `start_colon + 1` (i.e., `end_colon` must be at least `start_colon + 2`).
- `ind` must be less than `end_colon - 1`.

Thus, we can adjust the state to ensure these conditions are satisfied.

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `end_colon` is at least `start_colon + 2`, `i` is `ind + 1`, `pipe_count` is 0**
