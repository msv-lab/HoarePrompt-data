`end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is `bind - 2`, and since `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `i` must be at least `ind`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect this update.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `end_colon` is `bind - 2`.**
