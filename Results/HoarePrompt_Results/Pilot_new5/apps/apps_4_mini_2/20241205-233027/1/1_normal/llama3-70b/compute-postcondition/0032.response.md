According to the code, the loop will execute for a range defined as `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, meaning it will start from `n - 1` and decrement down to `0`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. 

The state of the variables that directly affect the loop execution are `n` and `i`. The variable `i` will be initialized to `n - 1` at the start of the loop.

To ensure that the loop can execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (to have a valid starting point for `i`).
- `i` will be set to `n - 1` at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, `bind` is -1, `f` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to n - 1**
