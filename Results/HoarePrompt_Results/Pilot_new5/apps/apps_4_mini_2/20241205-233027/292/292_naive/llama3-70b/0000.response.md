Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It continuously triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight while counting the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The provided examples in the problem description are properly handled:

1. For the input `4 7`, the weights evolve as follows:
   - Year 1: Limak (12), Bob (14) — Limak is still not larger.
   - Year 2: Limak (36), Bob (28) — Limak is now larger.
   - The output is `2`, which matches the expected result.

2. For the input `4 9`, the weights evolve as:
   - Year 1: Limak (12), Bob (18) — Limak is still not larger.
   - Year 2: Limak (36), Bob (36) — Limak is not larger yet.
   - Year 3: Limak (108), Bob (72) — Limak is now larger.
   - The output is `3`, matching the expected result.

3. For the input `1 1`, the weights evolve as:
   - Year 1: Limak (3), Bob (2) — Limak is now larger.
   - The output is `1`, which matches the expected result.

The program accounts for all edge cases outlined in the problem description, and since Limak's initial weight is guaranteed to be less than or equal to Bob's weight, the while loop will always execute at least once. Thus, I find no cases where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.
