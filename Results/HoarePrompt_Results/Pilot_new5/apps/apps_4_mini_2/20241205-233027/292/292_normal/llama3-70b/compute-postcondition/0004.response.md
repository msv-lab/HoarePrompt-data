The value of `b` is updated by multiplying it by 2. Given that the initial conditions state that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, the value of `b` will now be in the range `[2, 20]`, while `a` remains unchanged. The variable `years` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input value multiplied by 3, `b` is an integer equal to the second input value multiplied by 2, `years` is 0, and still 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10 valid**
