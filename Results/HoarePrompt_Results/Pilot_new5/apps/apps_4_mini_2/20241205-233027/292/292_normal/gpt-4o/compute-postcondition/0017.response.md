Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `a` (Limak's weight) and `b` (Bob's weight), both constrained by 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. It calculates the number of years required for Limak's weight to surpass Bob's weight, where Limak's weight triples each year and Bob's weight doubles. The function returns the total number of years it takes for this to happen. **
