`a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, and `b` is at least equal to `a`, the new value of `a` will be in the range of 3 to `3 * b`. The state of `b` remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and `3 * b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 20, and `b` must be at least equal to `a`.**
