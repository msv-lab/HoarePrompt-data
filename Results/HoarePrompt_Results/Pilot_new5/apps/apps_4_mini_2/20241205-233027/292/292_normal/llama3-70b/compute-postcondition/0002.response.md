According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. The loop will execute as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Right before the loop, we know that `a` is an integer equal to the first input value, `b` is an integer equal to the second input value, and `years` is 0. The condition 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10 is still valid, which means `a` can be equal to `b` at the start, allowing the loop to execute at least once.

However, if `a` is already equal to `b`, the loop will still execute one time. Since there are no further adjustments needed for the loop to execute one time, we can keep the current state.

State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input value, `b` is an integer equal to the second input value with the condition that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10 still valid, `years` is 0**
