In the initial state, `b` is an integer between `a` and 20, and it must be at least equal to `a`. When the code `b *= 2` is executed, the value of `b` is doubled. 

Given that `b` is at least `a` and `a` is between 3 and `3 * b`, `b` will now fall into a new range, being at least `2a` and still respecting the upper limit of 20. However, since `b` can only double as long as it does not exceed 20, we must state the new possible values for `b`.

1. If `b` was in the range [a, 10] (where doubling it does not exceed 20), then `b` will now be in the range [2a, 20].
2. If `b` was between 10 and 20, then doubling `b` will exceed 20. In such cases, `b` can only remain capped at 20.

Given these possibilities, the output state reflects that `b` has been updated while `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and `3 * b`, `b` is either in the range [2a, 20] or `b` is capped at 20.**
