The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is implied that it operates on two integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is the weight of Limak and `b` is the weight of Bob, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. Based on the provided constraints, the function will return a value based on the weights of Limak and Bob. However, the exact output logic has not been specified.

Given the provided information, the functionality of the function is as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates on integers a and b, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, representing the weights of Limak and Bob. The exact output based on these weights is not specified.**
