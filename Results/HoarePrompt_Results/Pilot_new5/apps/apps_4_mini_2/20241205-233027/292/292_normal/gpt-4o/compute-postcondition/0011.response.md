The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` is an integer between 3 and `3 * b`, the new value of `a` will be within the range of 9 and `9 * b`. The value of `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 9 and `9 * b`, `b` must be greater than `3` (if `b` is capped at 20).

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 9 and `9 * b`, `b` must be greater than `3` (if `b` is capped at 20)**
