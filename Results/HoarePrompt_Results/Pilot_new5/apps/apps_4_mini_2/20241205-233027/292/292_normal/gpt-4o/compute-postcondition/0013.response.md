The value of `years` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `years` is unknown from the initial state. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 9 and `9 * b`, `b` is now between 8 and 40 (b must be greater than 3 and capped at 20), and `years` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 9 and `9 * b`, `b` is now between 8 and 40 (b must be greater than 3 and capped at 20), and `years` is increased by 1.**
