Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It initializes the weights of Limak and Bob, and then uses a while loop to simulate the yearly weight increase (tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight) until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. 

The program does the following:
1. It reads the input weights of Limak (a) and Bob (b).
2. It initializes a counter for years.
3. It enters a loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (a) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (b).
4. Inside the loop, it updates Limak's weight to be three times its current weight and Bob's weight to be twice its current weight while incrementing the year counter.
5. When Limak's weight finally exceeds Bob's weight, it exits the loop and prints the year count.

All potential inputs within the defined constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) will work correctly, and thus the program satisfies the requirements of the problem description.
