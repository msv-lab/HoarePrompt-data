To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the program and the hints provided.

### Problem Description
The task is to compare two numbers expressed in the "golden system," which uses the number \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \) as its base. The decimal value of a string representation is given by the sum of its digits multiplied by powers of \( q \). The program should print ">", "<", or "=" depending on the comparison of the two values.

### Program Analysis
1. The program takes two binary strings as input.
2. It processes each string with the function `func_1`, which calculates the value of the string based on the powers of \( q \).
3. The comparison is then made based on these calculated values.

### Edge Cases
- The program assumes that both input strings are non-empty and consist only of '0's and '1's, as per the problem description.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the value of a binary string in the golden system by iterating through the string and summing the relevant powers of \( q \).

### Issues with the Program
- The output hints state that the function returns a numerical result based on the polynomial evaluation of the first string, which can be 5, 6, or 0 depending on the binary representation. This suggests there might be an inconsistency since the output hints imply that certain values are expected for specific inputs, which does not align with the accurate evaluation of arbitrary binary strings.
- The use of \( q \) and the way the sums are calculated can lead to precision errors when dealing with larger strings, especially since the lengths can reach up to 100,000.

### Output Hints Analysis
The hints provided suggest that the function only evaluates the first string, while the comparison is based on the results of both. Thus, it does not account for cases where the first string might yield a value that does not accurately represent the comparison with the second string, especially if the second string is not used in the evaluation.

### Conclusion
Given that the output hints imply the function can yield incorrect or incomplete evaluations based on the input strings provided, and since the program might not handle comparisons correctly for all possible cases, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation
The program fails to correctly compare two numbers in the golden system for all potential inputs, as hinted in the output that suggests the function can return misleading numeric values that do not correspond accurately with the inputs. An example where the program fails could be when one string is a prefix of another, which would lead to incorrect evaluation.
