Correctness: **False**

The given program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Function Input Expectation**: The `func_1` function is said to accept a tuple of binary strings, but in the program, it is actually called with only a single binary string `s1` or `s2`. Thus, the comment regarding `s` being a tuple of two strings is incorrect. Each call to `func_1` should only handle one binary string at a time.

2. **Misleading Comments**: The comments in the program suggest that the function is working with both binary strings when it actually processes only one. This creates confusion regarding the function's behavior. The function's purpose is to evaluate the decimal value of just one binary string, not both.

3. **Return Value Misinterpretation**: The function `func_1` is expected to evaluate the golden system representation of the binary string passed to it. However, the comment states that the function can return values such as 5, 6, or 0 based on specific inputs, which is misleading and does not reflect the actual possible outputs. The function should return a continuous range of values based on the evaluation of the polynomial expression rather than a limited set of numbers.

4. **Ineffective Comparison**: The logic for comparing the results of the two calls to `func_1(s1)` and `func_1(s2)` does not guarantee correct behavior because it relies on a flawed evaluation of the binary strings.

To summarize, the problem description clearly states that the program needs to compare the decimal values of two binary strings represented in the golden system. However, the implementation evaluates only one string at a time and does not correctly utilize both inputs for the comparison. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
