Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `s` containing two non-empty strings of binary characters ('0' and '1'). It calculates the weighted sum of these binary strings using the golden ratio (Ï†) as the base and returns the resulting decimal value. The function does not specifically handle cases where the strings may not be of equal length or if they contain invalid characters, but it processes the strings as they are. **
