The variable `decimal` is initialized to `0`. The previous values of `s` and `q` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`s` is a list of two non-empty strings, each containing only '0' and '1' characters; `q` is equal to `(math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`; `decimal` is 0.**
