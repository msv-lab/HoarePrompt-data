To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

The function `func_1(s)` computes the decimal value of a number represented in the "golden system" using the formula:

\[ \text{value} = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \]

where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).

1. The program reads two lines of input, each containing a non-empty string of '0's and '1's.
2. It calculates the decimal value of each string using `func_1`.
3. It compares the two calculated values and prints '>', '<', or '=' based on which value is larger or if they are equal.

The critical part to verify is whether `func_1` correctly implements the logic to compute the value of the input strings in the manner described.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Leading Zeros**: The function does not account for leading zeros. For example:
   - Input: `00100` should ideally compute the same as `100` in the golden system. However, `func_1` will process `00100` correctly because it still calculates the value based on positions of '1's.
   - However, `11` is `1 * q^1 + 1 * q^0 = q + 1`, which is the same as `00100`. The program handles this correctly and should return `=`.

2. **Large Input Strings**: The program does not appear to have any explicit performance issues as it processes up to 100,000 characters, but Python can handle large integers well. The calculation of powers of `q` remains feasible because it relies on a floating-point representation.

3. **Numerical Precision**: Floating-point errors could affect the comparison due to how Python handles floating-point arithmetic. If two values are very close but not exactly equal due to precision errors, it may lead to incorrect comparisons.

   - For example:
     - The inputs `110` and `101` would yield values for `func_1` as follows:
       - `110`: \( 1 \cdot q^2 + 1 \cdot q^1 = q^2 + q \)
       - `101`: \( 1 \cdot q^2 + 0 \cdot q^1 + 1 \cdot q^0 = q^2 + 1 \)
       - Since \( q^2 = q + 1 \), this means both will yield the same numerical value, but if `value1` and `value2` are very close, the original comparison may yield incorrect results due to floating-point precision.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above considerations, while the function appears to work correctly for various inputs, the reliance on floating-point calculations could lead to issues in very specific edge cases due to precision errors. Therefore, we can conclude that the program may not handle all potential inputs correctly.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not consistently produce correct output due to potential floating-point precision issues during the comparison of very closely valued outputs.
