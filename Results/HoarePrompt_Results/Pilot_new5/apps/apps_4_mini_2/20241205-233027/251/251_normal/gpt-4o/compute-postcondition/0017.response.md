According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute `i` times. Since `i` is 2, the loop will run for `j` values 0 and 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer but does not affect the loop, so it remains unchanged. The variable `j` needs to be initialized at the start of the loop, which is implicitly done by the `for` statement. 

As a result, for the loop to be executed, `j` starts at 0 and will increment during the loop, but its initial value is not explicitly stated in the state. The only states that need to be noted for the loop to execute correctly are the values of `i` and `j`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `i` is 2, `j` starts at 0**
