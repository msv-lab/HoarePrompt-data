To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. The loop iterates with `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, which means for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2 (since the loop starts at 1).
2. The list `cakes` must have at least `n` elements for the index `i` to be valid throughout the loop. However, since `n` is defined as a positive integer with an upper limit of 100,000, we can assume the list `cakes` has at least `n` elements.
3. The initial state also specifies that `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, which implies the first element in the `dp` list is initialized based on the first cake's volume.

Considering all these factors, the required states for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` starts at 1 (the first iteration).
- `dp` has been initialized such that `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we adjust the states as follows:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `cakes` must have at least `n` elements**
