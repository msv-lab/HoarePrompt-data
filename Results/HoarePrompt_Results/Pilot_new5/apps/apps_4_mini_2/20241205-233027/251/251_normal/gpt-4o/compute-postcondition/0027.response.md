Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `i` is 2, `j` has reached `i` (which is 2), `dp[i]` is equal to the maximum value considering all `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1` where `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`. If no `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` remains equal to its initial value `volumes[2]`.**
