According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute for values of `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, which means `j` will be 1. Since `i` is at least 4, this means `j` can take values of 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must remain at least 4, and `j` should be updated to 1 (the next value of j).

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 4, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, while `dp[j]` remains unchanged and `j` is 1.**
