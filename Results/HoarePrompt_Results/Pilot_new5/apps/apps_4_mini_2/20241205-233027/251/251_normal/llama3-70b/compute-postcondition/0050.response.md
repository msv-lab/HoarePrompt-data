According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and its relationship with `i`. The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `i`, which means that for the loop to run one more time, `j` must be less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 4. 

This implies that if before the next iteration of the loop `j` was at least 3 (the last value it could take to still be valid), then it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be equal to 4 (the next value). 

To summarize, since `i` can be at least 4, and the loop condition requires `j` to be less than `i`, then for the loop to run one more time, `j` should be 4. However, `i` itself does not change in this specific loop iteration context.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 4, `j` is 4**
