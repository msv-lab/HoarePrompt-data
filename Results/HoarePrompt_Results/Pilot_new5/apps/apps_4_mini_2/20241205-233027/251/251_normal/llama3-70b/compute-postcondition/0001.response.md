The `cakes` variable is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n`, `r_i`, and `h_i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cakes` is now an empty list while retaining the information about `n`, `r_i`, and `h_i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `r_i` and `h_i` are described by integers (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000); `cakes` is an empty list.**
