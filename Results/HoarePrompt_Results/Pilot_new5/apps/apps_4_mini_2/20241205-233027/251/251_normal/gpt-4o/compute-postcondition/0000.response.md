The variable `data` is assigned the value resulting from `input().split()`, which will be a list of strings. The precondition regarding `n` and `cakes` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this statement. The output state therefore reflects that `data` now holds the split input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r_i and h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively, with 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000; `data` is a list of strings from the input.**
