Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cake. It calculates the volume of each cake and then finds the maximum volume sum of cakes that can be stacked such that each cake below has a smaller volume than the one above it. The function returns the maximum volume sum achievable under these conditions. **
