According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `i`, which is currently 1. This means the loop will execute for `j` values starting from 0 up to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, which indicates that the loop has completed its iteration for `j` when it is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. However, since `j` would take the values from 0 to `i-1`, and `i` is currently 1, the next value for `j` would be 1. But this is not valid as `j` would exceed the range defined by `i`. Thus, the loop cannot execute again because `j` cannot take a value of 1 when `i` is 1 (the range for `j` would be empty).

So, in this case, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be increased, allowing `j` to take on a new valid value. Therefore, `i` must become at least 2 for the loop to iterate again.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` must be at least 2, `j` is 0, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, `cakes` must have at least `n` elements.**
