Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `volumes[i]` and `dp[0] + volumes[i]`, resulting in `dp[i]` being greater than its previous value.***
