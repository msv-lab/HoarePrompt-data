Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 4, `j` is 4. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[4] + cakes[i][0]`. If the condition is not met, nothing changes in the state of `dp[i]`.***
