Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `i` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `cakes` is a list of tuples (r_i, h_i) with (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000), `volumes` is a list of computed volumes [(math.pi * r_i * r_i * h_i) for (r_i, h_i) in cakes], and if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the sum of `volumes[0]` and `volumes[i]`. If `volumes[j]` is not less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp` remains unchanged with `dp[0]` equal to `volumes[0]` and all other `dp[k]` for k > 0 remaining zeros.***
