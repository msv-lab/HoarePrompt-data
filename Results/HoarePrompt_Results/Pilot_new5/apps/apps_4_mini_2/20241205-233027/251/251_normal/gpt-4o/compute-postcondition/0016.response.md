The value of `dp[i]` is set to `volumes[i]`. Since `i` is equal to 2, this means that `dp[2]` now takes the value of `volumes[2]`. The values of the other variables `n`, `i`, and `dp` remain unchanged, except for the updated value at `dp[2]`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `i` is 2; `dp[2]` is equal to `volumes[2]`**.
