The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial constraint that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 remains valid. The specific value of `n` will depend on the input provided, but it will still be within the defined range.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `n` is an input integer.**
