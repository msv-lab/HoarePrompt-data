The variable `dp[j]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[j]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The value of `dp[j]` will be the same before and after the operation, but it will now be restricted to the range of 0 to `MOD - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 2; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
