The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and returns the maximum value obtained from calling `func_1` with parameters `res` and `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `res` is initialized to 0 and is updated with the maximum value returned by `func_1` during the iterations.
