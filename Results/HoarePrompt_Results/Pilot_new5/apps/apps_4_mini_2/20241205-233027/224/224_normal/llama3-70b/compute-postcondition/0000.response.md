The line of code `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7` assigns a value to the variable `MOD`. This value is a specific integer equal to 1,000,000,007. The values of the other variables, `n` and `f_max_n`, remain unchanged and still valid as defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer that represents the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of integers 1 to n; `MOD` is 1000000007.**
