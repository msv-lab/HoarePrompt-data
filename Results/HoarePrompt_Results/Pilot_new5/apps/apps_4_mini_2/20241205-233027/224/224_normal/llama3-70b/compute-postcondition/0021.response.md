According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`, which is being decremented from `f_max_n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `f_max_n` is at least 2. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be decremented to 0 in the next iteration. For the loop to continue to execute, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, allowing `j` to start at 2 and decrement from there.

State: **`j` is 0, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD, dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD.`**
