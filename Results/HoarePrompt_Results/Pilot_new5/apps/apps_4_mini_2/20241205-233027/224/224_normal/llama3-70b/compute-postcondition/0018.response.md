According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the starting value `f_max_n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `f_max_n` is at least 2. After the last iteration, `j` will be decremented by 1, so `j` will become 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than 0. Since `j` is 1 after decrementing, the loop can execute again as long as `f_max_n` is at least 2 (to ensure it could start from a value of 2 or more).

State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD**
