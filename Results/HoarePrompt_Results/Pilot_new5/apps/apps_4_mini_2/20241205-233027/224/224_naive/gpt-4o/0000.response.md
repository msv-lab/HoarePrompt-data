To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step:

1. The function `func_1(n, mod)` computes the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`. This is done correctly in a loop that multiplies all integers from `2` to `n`.

2. The program checks if `n` is equal to `2`. If it is, the result is set to `1`. This is consistent with the problem description since for `n = 2`, the maximum value of `f(p)` is indeed `1` (only the permutation `[1, 2]` results in one distinct GCD).

3. For any `n > 2`, the program calls `func_1(n - 1, MOD)`, which calculates the factorial of `n-1`. This is intended to count the number of permutations that satisfy the GCD conditions.

4. However, it is essential to check if the values being calculated actually represent `f(p) = f_{max}(n)` correctly according to the problem description.

The critical point to verify is if `f(p)` for permutations of length `n` can indeed be captured correctly by `factorial(n - 1)` for all cases. The output implies that the number of permutations that yield the maximum distinct GCD values matches this factorial calculation.

### Testing with edge cases:
- For `n = 4`: The program would compute `func_1(3, MOD)` which gives `6`. However, we need to confirm whether there are indeed `6` permutations of length `4` that achieve the maximum `f_{max}(4)`. 

- The actual computation of distinct GCDs for all permutations of `4` would yield different values, and it's essential to determine if `factorial(3)` (which is `6`) corresponds correctly to the permutations that yield `f(p) = f_{max}(4)`.

Let's consider `n = 5`. The known permutations of `5` will create more complex GCD calculations due to the larger number set, and we need to ascertain whether `factorial(4)` (which is `24`) equals the number of permutations corresponding to the maximum distinct GCDs.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not explicitly validate how `f(p)` corresponds with `f_{max}(n)` for all potential values of `n`, and given the complexity of GCD calculations across various permutations, the program may inaccurately assume all permutations yield `factorial(n - 1)` results.

Thus, it is likely that for some inputs (like `4`, `5`, etc.), the program would not yield the correct count of permutations achieving the maximum distinct GCD counts.

**Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly in how it counts the permutations for `n > 2`. For example, for `n = 4`, `f_{max}(4)` and how many permutations achieve that is uncertain and not simply `factorial(3)`.**
