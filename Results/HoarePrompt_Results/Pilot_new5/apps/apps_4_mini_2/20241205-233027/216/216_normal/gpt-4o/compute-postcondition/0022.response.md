The variable `current_count` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous value of `current_count` was either `1` or remained unchanged based on the conditions provided. However, since the code directly assigns it to `0`, it overrides any previous evaluation. The values of `n`, `s`, `char`, `current_set`, and `max_count` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `char` is the second character in `s`; `current_set` is empty; `current_count` is 0; `max_count` is the maximum of the previous `max_count` and the current evaluation of `current_count`.**
