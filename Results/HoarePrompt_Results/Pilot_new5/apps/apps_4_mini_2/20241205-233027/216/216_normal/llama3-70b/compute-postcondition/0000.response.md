The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` was an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, but this constraint is still valid after the code has executed. The string `s` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length of n.**
