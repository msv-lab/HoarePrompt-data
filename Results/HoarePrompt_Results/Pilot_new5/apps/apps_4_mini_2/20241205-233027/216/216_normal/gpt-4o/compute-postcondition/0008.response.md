The code `current_set.add(char)` adds the variable `char` to the `current_set`. Since `char` is not already in `current_set`, it will be successfully added. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in `s` and a lowercase letter, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 0, and `char` is not in `current_set` (note: this statement is no longer valid as `char` has been added to `current_set`).**
