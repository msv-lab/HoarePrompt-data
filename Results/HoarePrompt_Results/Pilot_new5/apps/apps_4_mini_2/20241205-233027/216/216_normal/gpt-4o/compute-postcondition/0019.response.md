Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `char` is the second character in `s`. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` will contain `char` and `current_count` is increased by 1. If `char` is already in `current_set`, then `current_set` remains unchanged and `current_count` also remains unchanged.***
