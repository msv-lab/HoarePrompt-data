Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `char` is the third character in `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter, then if `char` is not in `current_set`, it is added to `current_set` and `current_count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `max_count` is updated to the maximum of `max_count` and `current_count`, `current_set` is cleared, and `current_count` is reset to 0.***
