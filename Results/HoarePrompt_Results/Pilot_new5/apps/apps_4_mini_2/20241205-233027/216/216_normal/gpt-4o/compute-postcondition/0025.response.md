The code snippet adds the variable `char` to the `current_set`. The initial state specifies that `char` is the third character in the non-empty string `s`, which has at least 3 characters. As a result, `char` will be a valid character from `s`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, but the `current_set` now includes `char`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200, `s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `s`, and `current_set` now includes `char`.**
