The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown. The values of `n`, `s`, `char`, and `current_set` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `char` is the second character in `s`; `current_set` contains `char`; `current_count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `char` is the second character in `s`; `current_set` contains `char`; `current_count` is increased by 1.**
