The code assigns `max_count` the maximum value between its current value and `current_count`. Given that `max_count` is initially 0 and `current_count` is also initially 0, the value of `max_count` will remain 0 after this operation as both values being compared are the same. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in `s`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0.
