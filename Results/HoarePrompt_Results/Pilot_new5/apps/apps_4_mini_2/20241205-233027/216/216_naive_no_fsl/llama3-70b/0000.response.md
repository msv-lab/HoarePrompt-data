Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions. 

For example, consider the input:

```
9
aAabcDdef
```

In this case, the lowercase letters are 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'f'. However, the uppercase letters ('A' and 'D') separate the lowercase letters into distinct segments: 

- The first segment before 'A' is just 'a'.
- The second segment after 'A' and before 'D' contains 'b', 'c'.
- The third segment after 'D' contains 'd', 'e', 'f'.

The pretty set for this input could contain 'a', 'b', 'c' from the first two segments and 'd', 'e', 'f' from the last segment. The correct maximum pretty set size is 6 (from the lowercase letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f' with no uppercase letters in-between). 

However, the program only counts the number of lowercase letters without considering the uppercase letters that separate them, thus producing an incorrect result. 

The implementation fails to satisfy the problem requirements, leading to an overall incorrect output for this input case.
