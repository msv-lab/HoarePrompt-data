Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions according to the problem description. 

To illustrate this, consider the following case:

Input:
```
5
abcAb
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

In this case, the pretty set of positions can be 0, 1, and 2 (which correspond to the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c') with no uppercase letters between them.

However, the program simply counts the number of lowercase letters without considering their positions and the presence of uppercase letters between them. Therefore, it would output `3`, which appears to be correct for this specific input; however, it does not account for the requirement that there must not be any uppercase letters between the chosen indices of lowercase letters. 

In another example:
Input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```
The pretty set can be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8, yielding a maximum of 2.

The program outputs the number of lowercase letters, which does not respect the conditions laid out in the problem description regarding uppercase letters and their blocking positions. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement.
