According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which controls how many times the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the index of the current iteration, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `j` is currently less than `n`, it will increase to `j + 1`, which still needs to be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, after the last iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`, which implies that the next value of `j` must at least be equal to `n`, resulting in a condition that will stop the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0 and `dp[1]` as the minimum cost to achieve a volume of 1, `j` is the index for the next iteration which must be less than `n`.**
