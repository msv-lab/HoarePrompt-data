The variable `dp[i]` is assigned the minimum value between `dp[i]` and `c[i]`. The variable `i` has the value 2, so we are specifically looking at `dp[2]`. The updated value of `dp[2]` will be `min(dp[2], c[2])`. The values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` remain unchanged as they are not impacted by this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is updated to min(dp[0], c[0]), `dp[1]` is updated to min(dp[1], c[1]), `dp[2]` is updated to min(dp[2], c[2])**
