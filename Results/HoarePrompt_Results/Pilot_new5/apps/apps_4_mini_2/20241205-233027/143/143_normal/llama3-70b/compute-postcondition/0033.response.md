Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0 and `dp[1]` as the minimum cost to achieve a volume of 1, `dp[i]` contains the minimum costs to achieve volumes from 0 to `L` considering all possible volumes `vol` calculated as `2^j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1` where `vol` must be less than or equal to `i` for the updates to happen. If the loop does not execute, `dp[i]` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
