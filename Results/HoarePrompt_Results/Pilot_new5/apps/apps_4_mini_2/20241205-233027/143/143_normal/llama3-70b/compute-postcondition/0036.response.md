The variable `vol` is assigned the value `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 0, we calculate `vol` as follows: `2 ** 0 - 1` equals `1 - 1`, which results in `0`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `j` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `vol` is 0**
