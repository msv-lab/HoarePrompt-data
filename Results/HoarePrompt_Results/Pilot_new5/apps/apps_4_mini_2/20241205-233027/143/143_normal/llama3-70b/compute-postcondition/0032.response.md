Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, and `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]`, and `j` is incremented by 1, while `vol` remains equal to 2.***
