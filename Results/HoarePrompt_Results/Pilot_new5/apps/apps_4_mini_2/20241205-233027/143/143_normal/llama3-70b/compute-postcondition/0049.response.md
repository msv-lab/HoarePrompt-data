Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0, `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `i` for all `i` in the range `[1, L]` considering the available volumes defined by `vol`, which are `2^j - 1` for `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`. If no valid volumes can be used to achieve a certain volume, `dp[i]` remains unchanged from its initial state of float('inf').**
