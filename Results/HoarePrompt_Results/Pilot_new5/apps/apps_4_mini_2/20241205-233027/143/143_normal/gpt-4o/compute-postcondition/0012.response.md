According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 31. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 on the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2. The conditions regarding `dp[i]` also suggest that the calculations would involve the updated values for `dp`, which would be determined in the loop body. Here, `dp[2]` will be updated based on the logic implemented in the omitted loop body.

State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to n-1; `dp[i]` is 10 for `i` in range n to 30; `i` is 2; `dp[2]` must be updated based on the logic of the loop body**
