The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `c`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 1 and 30. The parameter `L` is an integer that must be between 1 and \(10^9\). The parameter `c` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer in the list must be between 1 and \(10^9\). 

The function does not return any specific output in the provided information, so we cannot define the return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (between 1 and 30), an integer `L` (between 1 and 10^9), and a list `c` of `n` integers (each integer between 1 and 10^9).**
