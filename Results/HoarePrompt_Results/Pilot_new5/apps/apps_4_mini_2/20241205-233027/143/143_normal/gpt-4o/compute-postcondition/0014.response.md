According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which is currently at 2. The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range specified (1 to 30). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means it is still within the range. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than 31, which it will be in the next iteration since 3 is less than 31.

The states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `dp[i]` will be updated for `i = 3`, so we need to indicate that `dp[3]` will be computed based on the previous values and the costs.

State: **`dp[0]` is equal to `min(10, costs[0])`, `dp[1]` is equal to `min(10, costs[1])`, `dp[2]` is updated to `min(min(10, costs[2]), min(10, costs[1]) * 2)`, `dp[3]` is to be updated, `dp[i]` is 10 for `i` in range 4 to 30, `i` is 3**
