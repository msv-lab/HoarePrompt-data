The value of `vol` is computed as `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is currently `0`, the calculation yields `vol = 2 ** 0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost to achieve a volume of 1, and `dp[i]` contains the minimum costs to achieve a volume from 0 to `L`, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0.**
