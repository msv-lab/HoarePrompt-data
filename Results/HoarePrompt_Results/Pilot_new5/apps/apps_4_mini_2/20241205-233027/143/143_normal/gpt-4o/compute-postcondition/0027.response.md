The value of `L` is decremented by `1 << i`, which is equivalent to subtracting `2^i` from `L`. Since `i` is 29, this results in `L` being decremented by `2^29`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so we retain the previous values for `dp[i]`, `answer`, `current_cost`, and the information that `L` is used for comparison but was previously undefined and is now updated.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29; `i` is 29; `answer` is the minimum of `max_cost` and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`; `current_cost` is now equal to `previous current_cost + dp[29]`; `L` is now equal to `previous L - 2^29`.**
