#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), L is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and costs is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to n-1, and `dp[i]` is 10 for `i` in range n to 30.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to n-1; for `i` in range n to 30, `dp[i]` is updated based on previous values: `dp[i]` is `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`, resulting in the final values for `dp[i]` being the minimum between the original cost and double the previous dp value; `i` is 31 (loop completes).
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29; `i` is -1; `answer` is the minimum cost calculated based on `current_cost` and whether `L` was sufficient during iterations; `current_cost` is the total cost accumulated during the loop.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum cost accumulated in 'answer' based on 'current_cost' and the sufficiency of 'L' during iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list `costs`, and returns the minimum accumulated cost based on the specified conditions, considering the constraints of `L` and the provided costs. If `L` is insufficient to leverage the costs, the function may return a high value indicating this limitation.
