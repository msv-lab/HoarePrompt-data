The code assigns a new value to `dp[i]` based on the current values of `dp[i]`, `dp[i - vol]`, and `costs[j]`. Here, `i` is `k + 1`, and `vol` is 3. Given that `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, we can compute:

- The value of `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the value of `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`.
- `vol` is equal to 3, so `i - vol` equals `k + 1 - 3`, which is `k - 2`.

The previous states of the variables are not explicitly detailed in the output state since the specific values of `dp`, `costs`, and `k` are unknown.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `j` is 2, `i` is `k + 1`, `vol` is 3, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[k - 2] + costs[2]`**
