In the provided initial state, we have:

- `dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29. Specifically, for `i = 28`, `dp[28]` is `min(10, costs[28])`.
- `i` is 28.
- `answer` is updated to `min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[28])`.

The code snippet `current_cost += dp[i]` adds the current value of `dp[28]` to `current_cost`. 

To summarize the impact:

- `current_cost` is incremented by the value of `dp[28]`, which is `min(10, costs[28])`.
- The values of `dp`, `i`, and `answer` remain unchanged, as they are not directly modified.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29; `i` is 28; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`; `answer` is updated to `min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[28])`.**
