The values of `n` and `L` are assigned based on the input values taken from the user. Since `n` is between 1 and 30 and `L` is between 1 and 10^9, the output state will reflect that `n` and `L` are now specific integers, but the exact values depend on user input. The list `c` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30; `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9; `c` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.**
