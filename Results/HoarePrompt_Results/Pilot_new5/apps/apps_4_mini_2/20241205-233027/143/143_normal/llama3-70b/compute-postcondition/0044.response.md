According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 30, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes `j` equal to 2. Since `n` is still greater than 2, the loop can still execute.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `j` is 2, `i` is `k + 1`, `vol` is 1; if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`.**
