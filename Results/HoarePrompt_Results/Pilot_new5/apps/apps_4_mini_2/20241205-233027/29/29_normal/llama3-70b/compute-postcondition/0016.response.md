According to the code, the loop will execute based on the contents of the `examples` list. For the loop to execute at least once, `examples` must contain at least one element. 

Given the current state where `n` is a positive integer, it is possible that `examples` could be empty if there are no tuples in `files` where the second element is 1. Therefore, we must ensure that the `examples` list has at least one element.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` must be initialized to 1, as specified by the `enumerate` function with `start=1`. The variable `file` will initially be the first element of the `examples` list.

So, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the integer values from each tuple, `examples` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `file` is the first element in `examples`, `i` is 1**
