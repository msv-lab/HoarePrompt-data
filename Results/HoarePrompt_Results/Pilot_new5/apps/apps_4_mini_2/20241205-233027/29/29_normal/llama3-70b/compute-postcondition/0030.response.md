The line of code `print(len(script))` calculates the length of the list `script`. The contents of `script` are strings formatted as `move {file} {j}` for each `j` from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + n`. Therefore, the length of `script` can be determined by the values of `len(examples)` and `n`.

The range for `j` is from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + n`, which includes `n` total elements. Thus, `len(script)` is equal to `n`.

The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order, `examples` is a list that can have at least 0 elements, `regular` must contain `n` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + n`, `file` is the last element of `regular`, `script` has `n` strings, and the output is `n`.**
