Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` contains string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` is a list containing filenames from `files` where the type is '0' and has at least one element, `moves` is a list of all move instructions made, `i` is still 0, `regulars[0]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` does not contain the string representation of `temp_counter`, `regulars` now includes `temp_counter` as its first element, and `moves` now contains the instruction `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}`.***
