According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`. 

For the loop to execute again, both conditions must be satisfied:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, which means it could be equal to `2 * n` or less. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `temp_counter` regarding the first condition.

However, we do not have information about `str(temp_counter)` being in `files_set`. Since it is stated that `str(temp_counter)` should be in `files_set`, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` corresponds to a string that is indeed within `files_set`.

To guarantee that `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`, we must ensure that `temp_counter` is set to a value that meets both conditions. Hence, we need to adjust the state to affirm that `str(temp_counter)` remains in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must remain in `files_set`**
