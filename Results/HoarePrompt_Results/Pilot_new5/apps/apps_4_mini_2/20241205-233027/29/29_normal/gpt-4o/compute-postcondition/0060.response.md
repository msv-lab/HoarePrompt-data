Output State: **`temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 1` and `2 * n`, `i` is updated to `i + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` after the loop terminates. If the loop did not execute, then `temp_counter` remains unchanged and `i` is still `i + 1`.**
