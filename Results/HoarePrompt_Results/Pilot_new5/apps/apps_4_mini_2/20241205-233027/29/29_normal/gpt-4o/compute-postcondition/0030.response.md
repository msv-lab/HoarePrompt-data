Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` remains a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 filename from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is an empty list, and `i` is still 0 with the current value of `examples[i]` not equal to `str(i + 1)`.**
