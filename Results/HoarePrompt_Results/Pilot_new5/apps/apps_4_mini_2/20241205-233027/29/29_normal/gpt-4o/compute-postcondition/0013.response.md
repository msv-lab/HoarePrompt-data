Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the string in `file`, `type_` is the second part of the string in `file`. If `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` includes `name`. Otherwise, `regulars` now includes `name`.***
