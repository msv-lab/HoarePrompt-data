According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from 0 up to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100000. 

Since the loop has already executed once, the loop will execute one more time only if it has not reached the total of `n` iterations. Therefore, if the loop has executed once, we can conclude that it has completed 1 iteration.

For the loop to be executed one more time, we need to increment the count of iterations by 1. Thus, `_` will become 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be a positive integer (which it is), so:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing the tuple (name, int(type_)), `_` is 1**
