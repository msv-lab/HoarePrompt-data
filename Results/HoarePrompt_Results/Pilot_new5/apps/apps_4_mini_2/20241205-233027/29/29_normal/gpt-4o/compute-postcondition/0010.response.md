The variable `file` is the second tuple in `files`, which is a string containing at least two parts separated by a space. The code assigns `name` and `type_` the first and second parts of the string resulting from splitting `file`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the string in `file`, and `type_` is the second part of the string in `file`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the string in `file`, `type_` is the second part of the string in `file**.
