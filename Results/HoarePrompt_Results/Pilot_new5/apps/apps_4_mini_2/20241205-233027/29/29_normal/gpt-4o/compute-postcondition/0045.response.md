Output State: **`temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 1` and `2 * n + k` for some positive integer `k`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. If `temp_counter` was initially greater than `2 * n`, the loop will not execute, and `temp_counter` remains as it was, while the value of `n` stays as a positive integer.**
