Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` has been updated to `i + 1`, the length of `examples` remains unchanged, and if `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, then `temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 2` and `2 * n + 1`, `examples[i]` is the string representation of the previous value of `temp_counter`, and `moves` contains an additional entry formatted as `move {examples[i]} {i + 1}`.***
