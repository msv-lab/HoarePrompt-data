According to the code, the loop iterates over the `script` list. For the loop to execute, `script` must contain at least 1 string. Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), it allows for the possibility that `script` can be empty. To ensure the loop executes, `script` must have at least 1 string.

Additionally, the variable `line` will represent the first string in `script` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `script` must have at least 1 string.
- `line` is the first string in the `script`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order, `examples` is a list that can have at least 0 elements, `regular` must contain `n` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + n`, `file` is the last element of `regular`, `script` has at least 1 string, `line` is the first string in `script`**
