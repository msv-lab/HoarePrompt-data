The `files` list is being updated to include a new tuple `(name, int(type_))`. The variable `type_` is converted to an integer using `int()`, and the tuple is appended to the `files` list. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) that must be greater than or equal to 2; `files` is now a list containing the previous tuples and includes the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`.**
