The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n` prior to execution, it remains valid after this increment. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 filename from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n` and `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1.**
