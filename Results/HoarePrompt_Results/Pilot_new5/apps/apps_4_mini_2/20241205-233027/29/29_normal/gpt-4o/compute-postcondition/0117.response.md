Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, and if `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)`, `temp_counter` remains greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and `moves` includes an entry formatted as 'move {str(temp_counter)} {target}'.***
