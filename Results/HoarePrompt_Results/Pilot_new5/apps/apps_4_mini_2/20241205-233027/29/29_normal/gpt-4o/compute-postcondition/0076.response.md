According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `files_set`. The loop will execute again if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and if `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, which is greater than `2 * n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Furthermore, since `temp_counter` is currently `2 * n + 1`, it also must be ensured that it can still be found in `files_set`. 

To satisfy both conditions, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n`, and we must ensure that `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` contains string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` is a list containing filenames from `files` where the type is '0' and must have at least 1 element, `moves` is a list of all move instructions made, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n`, and `str(2 * n)` must be in `files_set`**
