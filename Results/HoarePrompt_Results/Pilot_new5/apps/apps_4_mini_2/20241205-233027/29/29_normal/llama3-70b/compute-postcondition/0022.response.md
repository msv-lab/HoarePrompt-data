To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the loop and its effects on the variables based on the initial state and the conditions for execution.

The loop iterates over the `examples` list, adding strings to the `script` list that instructs moving a file identified by the first element of each tuple in `examples`. The variable `i` is used to denote the index of the current iteration, starting from 1.

From the initial state, we recognize:
- `n` is a positive integer within a specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
- `files` is a list containing `n` tuples.
- `examples` is a list derived from `files`, containing elements where the second element of the tuple is 1; thus, its length can vary based on the contents of `files`.
- `script` starts as an empty list.

The loop's execution depends on the number of elements in `examples`:
- If `examples` has `k` elements, the loop executes `k` times.

Now, let's consider the output state after completing all iterations of the loop:

- If `examples` contains `k` elements, where `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, the values will be:
  - `i` will equal `k` after the loop finishes.
  - `file` will be equal to the `k`-th element in `examples`.
  - `script` will contain `k` instructions, formatted as `move {file} j` for each `j` from 1 to `k`.

However, if `examples` is empty (i.e., has 0 elements), the loop does not execute, and:
- `script` remains empty.
- `i` is never assigned and thus is undefined in the context of the loop.

In summary, we need to reflect on both cases: when the loop runs and when it does not.

Therefore, the complete output state after all iterations of the loop (considering both scenarios) is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the integer values from each tuple, `examples` is a list that can have at least 0 elements, `script` now includes instructions `move {file} j` for each `j` from 1 to the length of `examples`, where `file` is the last element from `examples` if it is non-empty, otherwise `script` is empty.**
