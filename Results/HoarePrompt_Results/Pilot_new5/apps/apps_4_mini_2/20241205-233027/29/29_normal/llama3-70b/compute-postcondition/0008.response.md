According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and it should be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again, we have:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) that must be greater than or equal to 2, `files` is a list containing the previous tuples and now includes the new tuple `(name, type_)`, `_` is 2, `name` is a string, `type_` is an integer**
