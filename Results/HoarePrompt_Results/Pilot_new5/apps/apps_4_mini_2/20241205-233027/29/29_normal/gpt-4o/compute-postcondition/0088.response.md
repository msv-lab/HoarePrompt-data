To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop.

The loop statement is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

1. The variable `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` for the first part of the condition to be true.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set` for the second part of the condition to be true.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1` (hence `temp_counter > 2 * n`).
- `files_set` does not contain the string representation of `temp_counter`.

Now let's evaluate:

- Since `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, it cannot satisfy the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`. Therefore, we need to adjust `temp_counter` to ensure that it is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
  
- Additionally, since `files_set` does not contain `str(temp_counter)`, we need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is included in `files_set` for the loop to iterate.

To make these adjustments, we can state that:
- `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `temp_counter` must also be such that its string representation is included in `files_set`.

Thus, the required modifications can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter must be less than or equal to 2 * n`, and `temp_counter must be in files_set as a string representation`**.
