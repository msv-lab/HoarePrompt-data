The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, it remains within that constraint after the increment. The states of the other variables are not affected, as the operation only modifies `temp_counter`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 filename from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and remains less than or equal to `2 * n`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`**.
