According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is specified as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), the loop will execute exactly `n` times. The underscore `_` is commonly used as a throwaway variable, indicating that we do not need to use its value within the loop body. 

Before the loop starts, `files` is an empty list, but this does not affect the execution of the loop as `files` will be modified within the loop (presumably). Since `n` is already given to be a positive integer, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Thus, the states that need to be set before the loop are:

- `n` is a positive integer as defined.
- The loop will iterate `n` times, but we do not need to set any specific value for the throwaway variable.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is an empty list**
