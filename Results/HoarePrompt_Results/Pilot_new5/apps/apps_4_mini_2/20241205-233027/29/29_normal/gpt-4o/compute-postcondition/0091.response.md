The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Prior to this operation, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and since `temp_counter` is incremented, it will now be equal to its previous value plus 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and must now be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.**
