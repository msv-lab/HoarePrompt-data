The variable `examples` is assigned a list comprehension that iterates over the `files` list, collecting the first element of each tuple (i.e., `file[0]`) where the second element of the tuple (i.e., `file[1]`) is equal to 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it defines the length of `files`, and the structure of `files` is also unchanged. The output will show that `examples` is now a list of the first elements from those tuples in `files` where the second element is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the integer values from each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements from the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1.**
