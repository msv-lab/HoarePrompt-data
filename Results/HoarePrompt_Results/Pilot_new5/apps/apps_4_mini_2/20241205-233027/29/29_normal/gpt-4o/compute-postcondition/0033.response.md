The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` is already greater than `2 * n`, so after the increment, it will still be greater than `2 * n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` remains a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 filename from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is a list containing the string `move {examples[0]} {temp_counter}`, `i` is still 0 with the current value of `examples[i]` not equal to `str(i + 1)`, and `temp_counter` is now greater than `2 * n` plus 1.**
