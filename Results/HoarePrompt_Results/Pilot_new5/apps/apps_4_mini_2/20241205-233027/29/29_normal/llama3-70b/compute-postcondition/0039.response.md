Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and processes `n` lines of input, each containing a distinct name (a string of digits and lowercase letters of length 1 to 6) and a type ('0' for regular tests or '1' for example tests). It sorts the files based on their type, prioritizing example tests over regular tests. The function generates and prints commands to move these files, assigning positions based on their type, and outputs the total number of move commands generated. If there are no example tests, the move commands for regular tests will follow consecutively after the example tests. **
