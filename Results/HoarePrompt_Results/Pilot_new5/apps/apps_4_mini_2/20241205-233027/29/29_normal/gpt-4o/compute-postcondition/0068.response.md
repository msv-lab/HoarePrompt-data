Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '1', `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is a list containing the strings indicating moves made, and `temp_counter` is a positive integer equal to `n + 1`.

Output State after the loop executes completely: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is updated to contain string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` remains unchanged, `moves` is a list that contains all move instructions corresponding to the filenames in `examples` that did not match their expected positions, `i` is equal to `len(examples)`, and `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` contains string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` is a list containing the filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` is a list of all move instructions made, `i` equals `len(examples)`, and `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`.**
