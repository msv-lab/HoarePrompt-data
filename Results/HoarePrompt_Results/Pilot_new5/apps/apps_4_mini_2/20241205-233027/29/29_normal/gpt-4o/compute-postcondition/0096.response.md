`regulars[i]` is assigned the value of `str(temp_counter)`. Since `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` will represent a string that corresponds to that value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `moves` now includes the string `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}' and `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `moves` now includes the string `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}' and `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`.**
