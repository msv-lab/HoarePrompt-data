The variable `name` and `type_` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string. The input can be any string consisting of two parts separated by a space. The previous values of `n` and `files` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the input operation. Thus, the output state must reflect the unchanged state of `n` and `files`, along with the newly introduced variables `name` and `type_`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is an empty list, `name` is the first part of the input string, `type_` is the second part of the input string**.
