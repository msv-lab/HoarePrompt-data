To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions.

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are satisfied:
1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

Currently, at the end of the last iteration:
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, which means `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`. This means that the first condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`) is not satisfied.
- To allow the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted to a value that is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Therefore, we can change `temp_counter` to be `2 * n` or any value less than `2 * n`.

Next, we also need to ensure that the second condition (`str(temp_counter) in files_set`) can still be satisfied. Assuming that `files_set` contains string representations of integers, we can set `temp_counter` to `2 * n` to ensure it satisfies both conditions.

No other variables need adjustments based on the provided state.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the next iteration are:
- `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be equal to `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` contains string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` is a list containing filenames from `files` where the type is '0' and must have at least 1 element, `moves` is a list of all move instructions made, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` must be `2 * n`, and `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`.**
