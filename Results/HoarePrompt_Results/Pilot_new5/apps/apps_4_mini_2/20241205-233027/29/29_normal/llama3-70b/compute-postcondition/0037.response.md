The loop iterates over each string in the `script` list and prints them. The initial state specifies that `script` has at least one string, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The number of strings in `script` determines how many times the loop will run. 

If the loop executes all its iterations, the values of the variables will be as follows:

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
- `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order.
- `examples` is a list that can have at least 0 elements.
- `regular` must contain `n` elements.
- `i` is `len(examples) + n`.
- `file` is the last element of `regular`.
- `script` has `n` strings, and all strings in `script` have been printed.

The total number of iterations corresponds to the length of the `script`. After all iterations, `script` will contain the same strings, and `line` will represent the last string printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order, `examples` is a list that can have at least 0 elements, `regular` must contain `n` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + n`, `file` is the last element of `regular`, `script` has `n` strings, and all strings in `script` have been printed.**
