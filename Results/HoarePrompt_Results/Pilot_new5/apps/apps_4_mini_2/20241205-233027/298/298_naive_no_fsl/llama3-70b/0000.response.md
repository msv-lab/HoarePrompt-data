Correctness: **False**

The program has a logic flaw regarding the calculation of the area of the triangle. It checks if `n * m % k` is non-zero to determine if a triangle can be formed, but this alone does not guarantee that the calculated area of the triangle will equal `nm/k`. The triangle area should be checked to ensure it matches the required area after determining if a valid triangle can be created.

For instance, consider the input:
```
n = 4, m = 4, k = 8
```
In this case, `nm/k = 4` but the program might not correctly produce three points that satisfy the area condition, only checking the divisibility condition.

Moreover, the logic in `func_3` and its relation to the triangle area isn't clearly ensuring that the triangle formed actually has the desired area. Thus, there exist examples where the program could output "YES" without actually having a triangle of the correctly computed area. 

Hence, the program can fail for certain valid inputs, and therefore it does not adhere to the problem requirements in every case.
