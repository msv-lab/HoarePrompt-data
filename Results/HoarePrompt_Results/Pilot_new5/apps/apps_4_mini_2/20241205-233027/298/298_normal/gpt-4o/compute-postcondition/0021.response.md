Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, `area` remains an integer, `area` is not equal to 0, and `2 * area` is greater than `n`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `2 * area` is greater than `m` and the printed output is `0 {m // 2}`.***
