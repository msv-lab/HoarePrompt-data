Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` through user input, calculates the area as `(n * m) / k`, and checks if this area is a positive integer. If the area is not an integer or is zero, it prints 'NO'. If the area is a positive integer, it prints 'YES' and provides coordinates based on the value of `2 * area`: if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints coordinates `(2 * area, 1)` and `(0, 1)`; if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, it prints `(1, 2 * area)` and `(1, 0)`; otherwise, it prints `(n, m // 2)` and `(0, m // 2)`.**
