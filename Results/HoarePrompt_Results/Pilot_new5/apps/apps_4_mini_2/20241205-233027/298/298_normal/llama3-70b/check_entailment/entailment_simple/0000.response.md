To assess the correctness of the annotated program against the given problem description, let's analyze the program step by step based on the requirements:

1. **Input and Initial Conditions**:
   - The program reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is an integer by verifying if \( n \times m \% k \) is zero. This is necessary because the area of the triangle must be a whole number.

2. **Finding Points**:
   - The program calls `func_3(n, m)` which utilizes a helper function `func_2` to compute a certain tuple. The result from `func_3` provides two values \( n1 \) and \( m1 \), along with \( g = x \times n + y \times m \) (where \( x \) and \( y \) are returned from `func_2`).
   - The program then checks whether \( |n1 \times m| \) is greater than or equal to \( g \). This condition is crucial for determining the possibility of forming a triangle with the required area.

3. **Output**:
   - If the condition is satisfied, the program outputs "YES" followed by three points:
     - (0, 0)
     - (0, \( n1 \times m / g \))
     - (\( m1 \times m / g \), 0)
   - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Analysis of Correctness:
- **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle defined by the points is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). The points generated need to satisfy the area requirement of \( \frac{nm}{k} \). However, the conditions under which the triangle can be formed rely on the chosen points not exceeding the bounds defined by \( n \) and \( m \).
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where the calculated points might exceed their limits or lead to infeasible configurations that do not yield a valid triangle.
  
### Conclusion:
The program may not guarantee that it always provides valid triangle points within the defined boundaries, especially without additional checks or constraints on the positions of the points which are derived from the calculations involving \( n1, m1, g \). There are scenarios where the calculated points could potentially exceed the specified ranges of \( n \) and \( m \) or not fulfill the area condition properly.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
