Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to the following reasons:

1. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area as `area = n * m / k`, which is correct. However, it does not validate whether it is possible to find three integer points whose area equals `nm/k`. The area of a triangle formed by three points is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
   \]
   The program does not ensure that the calculated area can be represented by the coordinates provided, which may not yield an integer area or even a valid triangle.

2. **Output Points**: The points generated by the program do not guarantee that they will satisfy the area of the triangle equal to `nm/k`. For various combinations of `n`, `m`, and `k`, the printed points may not form a valid triangle that achieves the required area, particularly in cases where `2 * area > n` or `2 * area > m`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The logic implemented in the program does not adequately address edge cases where the area is not realizable with integer points. For instance, if `k` were such that `nm/k` results in a non-integer area or if the area is not achievable with integer coordinates within the bounds, the program would still print coordinates without validation.

4. **Lack of Comprehensive Validity Checks**: The program checks if the area is an integer and if it is zero, but it does not appropriately check if valid triangle points can be generated under the constraints given. The program's logic fails to ensure that the points it generates are indeed within the specified bounds and that they can form a triangle with the specified area.

In summary, while the program attempts to generate points based on calculations, it does not ensure that these points will meet the criteria set by the problem description for all valid inputs. Thus, it cannot be considered correct.
