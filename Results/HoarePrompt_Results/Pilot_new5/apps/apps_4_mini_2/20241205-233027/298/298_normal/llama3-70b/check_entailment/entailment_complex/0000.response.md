To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) within specified bounds such that the area of the triangle formed by these points equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
2. The outputs must correctly reflect whether a solution exists ("YES" and the points) or not ("NO").
3. The values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) are bounded by specified limits.

### Code Analysis:
- The first check is whether \(n \times m\) is divisible by \(k\). If not, it immediately prints "NO". This is an important condition because the area must be a whole number.
  
- The function `func_3(n, m)` calls `func_2` to compute values needed to find the integer points. The output of `func_2` is used to calculate the area, and subsequently, it checks if the conditions for forming a triangle are met.

### Annotations:
- The annotations discuss the purpose of `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. They provide insights into how the GCD is calculated and how the triangle coordinates are derived.

### Validity Check:
1. **Divisibility Check**: If \(n \times m \mod k \neq 0\), we correctly output "NO".
2. **Finding Triangle Vertex Coordinates**: The program calculates potential points based on the results from `func_3`. The coordinates are:
   - \((0, 0)\)
   - \((0, n1 \times m // g)\)
   - \((m1 \times m // g, 0)\)

3. **Area Calculation**: The area formed by these points must equal \(\frac{nm}{k}\). It remains unclear from the annotations if the logic implemented adequately guarantees that the points will always form a valid triangle with the required area in cases where the divisibility condition is met.

### Potential Issues:
1. For certain combinations of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\), the points computed may not be in bounds \([0, n]\) for \(x\) and \([0, m]\) for \(y\).
   - E.g., if \(g\) (the GCD) is very small, \(n1 \times m // g\) and \(m1 \times m // g\) could exceed the values of \(n\) and \(m\) respectively, leading to invalid coordinates.
  
2. The example where \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), \(k = 7\) demonstrates a case where \( \frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7} \) is not an integer, hence "NO" is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee to produce valid points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) for every valid input scenario. Specifically, it may fail when the GCD-derived coordinates exceed their respective bounds.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

An example case where the program fails is when \(n = 1, m = 1, k = 2\), which leads to an area of \(\frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5\), and hence should output "NO". However, if the implementation miscalculates or produces points outside valid bounds, it would incorrectly suggest an area is possible when it is not.
