Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `unrated` is either `True` or `False` (depending on the conditions in the loop), `i` is 2, and `j` is `n` (the loop executes from 3 to `n-1`). If no break occurs, `unrated` remains `True`, indicating that the conditions were not met for any value of `j` in the range.**
