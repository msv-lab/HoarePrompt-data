According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from 0 up to `n-1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to `n`, which is outside the valid range for the loop. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, `n` must be adjusted to be at least `n + 1`, which would mean `_` would become `n`.

Also, the lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as they do not affect the iteration count directly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1001; `ratings_before` is a list containing `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing `b`; `_` is `n`**
