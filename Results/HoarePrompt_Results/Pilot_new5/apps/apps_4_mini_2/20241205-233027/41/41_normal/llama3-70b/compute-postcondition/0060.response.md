Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `unrated` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 3. If the value of `ratings_before[2]` is less than the value of `ratings_before[3]` and the value of `ratings_after[2]` is greater than the value of `ratings_after[3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
