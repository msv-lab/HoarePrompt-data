The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, the value of `ratings_before[1]` is less than the value of `ratings_before[2]`, the value of `ratings_after[1]` is greater than the value of `ratings_after[2]`, `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
