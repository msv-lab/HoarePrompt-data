The value of `is_unrated` is explicitly assigned `True`, which overrides its previous potential value based on the condition with `ratings[i - 1][0]` and `ratings[i][0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 3, and `is_unrated` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 3, `is_unrated` is True**
