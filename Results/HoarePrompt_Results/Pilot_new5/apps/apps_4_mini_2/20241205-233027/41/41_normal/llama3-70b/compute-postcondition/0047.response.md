According to the code, the loop iterates with `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 2) up to `n - 1`. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 3, `j` can take on values starting from 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to increment by 1, which means `j` would become 4. However, for the loop to execute again, `j` must remain less than `n`. Since `n` is at least 3, we need `n` to be at least 5 for `j` to be 4.

State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 1, `j` is 4**
