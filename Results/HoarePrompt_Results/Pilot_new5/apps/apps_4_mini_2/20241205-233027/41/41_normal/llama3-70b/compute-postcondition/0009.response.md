The code `ratings_before.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the list `ratings_before` will now include the new element `a`. The values of `ratings_after` and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1001; `ratings_before` now includes the integer `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1001; `ratings_before` now includes `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing `b`.**
