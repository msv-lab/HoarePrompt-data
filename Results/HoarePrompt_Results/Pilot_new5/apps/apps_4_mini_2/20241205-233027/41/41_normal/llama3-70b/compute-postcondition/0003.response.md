According to the code, the loop executes `n` times, and since `n` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 2, it will execute at least once. The loop variable represented by `_` does not need to be tracked, so we do not need to modify anything related to it.

However, since `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are both empty lists before the loop starts, there's no specific requirement on their contents for the loop to execute, as the loop does not depend on them. 

To summarize, while the values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` do not specifically affect the execution of the loop, we can note their existence. At the end of the loop's last iteration, `_` would represent the value corresponding to the last iteration, which is `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `_` will represent the last value n-1 after the loop**
