According to the code, the loop executes a total of `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1001, which means the loop has not yet executed `n` times. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the loop can continue executing based on its limit.

If the loop has executed `k` times so far, then `k` must be less than `n`. We increment `k` for each iteration, so at the end of the last iteration, we can infer that the loop has completed `k` iterations, and `k` would be `n - 1` after the last iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than `k`, which is currently `n - 1`. This means that `n` must remain unchanged, while the loop variable (which we denote as `_`) is a placeholder and does not need to maintain any specific value. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` remains the same, and we can define the state reflecting that `_` would be taken as the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1001; `ratings_before` includes `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing `b`, and `b` has been appended to it.**
