The value of `ratings_before` is updated by appending the value of `a` to it. The list `ratings_after` remains unchanged since it includes the new value `b`, which is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the updated state reflects the addition of `a` to `ratings_before`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1001; `ratings_before` includes `a` appended to it; `ratings_after` includes the new value `b`.**
