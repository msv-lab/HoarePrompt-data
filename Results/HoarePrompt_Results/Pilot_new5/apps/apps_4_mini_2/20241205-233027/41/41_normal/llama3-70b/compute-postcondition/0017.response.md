The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `True`, but it does not affect any other variables. The states of `n`, `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `a`, `b`, and `rated` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers from inputs; `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers from inputs; `a` is the last input integer for ratings_before; `b` is the last input integer for ratings_after; `rated` is False; `unrated` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers from inputs; `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers from inputs; `a` is the last input integer for ratings_before; `b` is the last input integer for ratings_after; `rated` is False; `unrated` is True.**
