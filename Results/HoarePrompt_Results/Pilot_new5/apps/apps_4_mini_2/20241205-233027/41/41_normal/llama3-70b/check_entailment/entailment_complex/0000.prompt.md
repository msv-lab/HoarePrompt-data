You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

2777 2777

2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, and for each participant i (where 1 <= i <= n), a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 4126, representing their ratings before and after the round respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        ratings_before.append(a)
        
        ratings_after.append(b)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers from inputs; `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers from inputs; `a` is the last input integer for ratings_before; `b` is the last input integer for ratings_after.
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i
                ] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        
        if not unrated:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers; `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers; `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`; `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`; `rated` is False; `unrated` is False; `maybe` is True. The loop will check the conditions for all pairs of ratings, and if any pair meets the condition leading to a change in `unrated`, the state of `unrated` will be False. If no such pair is found, `unrated` will remain True.
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` integers. `rated` is True if there is at least one pair of different ratings between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`; otherwise, `rated` is False. `unrated` remains True if all pairs of ratings are equal, otherwise, it is False. `maybe` is True.
    if rated :
        print('rated')
    else :
        if unrated :
            print('unrated')
        else :
            print('maybe')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` integers, `rated` is False, and `maybe` is True. If `unrated` is True, 'unrated' is printed. Otherwise, `unrated` is False and 'maybe' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` integers. If `rated` is True, the output includes 'rated'. If `rated` is False, `maybe` is True. If `unrated` is True, the output includes 'unrated'; otherwise, 'maybe' is printed while `unrated` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes the ratings of `n` participants (where `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000). It reads ratings before and after a round for each participant. The function determines whether the ratings are 'rated' (if any participant's rating has changed), 'unrated' (if the ratings before and after are the same for all participants), or 'maybe' (if there is an inconsistency in the ratings where some participants have increased ratings before and decreased afterwards). It outputs one of the three results based on these checks.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
