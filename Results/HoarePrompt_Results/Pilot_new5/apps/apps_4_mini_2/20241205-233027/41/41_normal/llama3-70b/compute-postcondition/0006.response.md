`ratings_after` gets an element `b` appended to it. The initial state of `ratings_after` is an empty list, so after the append operation, `ratings_after` will contain one element, which is the value of `b`. 

The other variables remain unchanged in their previous conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `a`; `ratings_after` is now a list containing `b`; `_` is `n-1`; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing `b`; `_` is `n-1`; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.**
