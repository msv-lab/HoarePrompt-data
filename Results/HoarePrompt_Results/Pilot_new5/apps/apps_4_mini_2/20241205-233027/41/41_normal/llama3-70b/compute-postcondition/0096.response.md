Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` integers. If `rated` is True, the output includes 'rated'. If `rated` is False, `maybe` is True. If `unrated` is True, the output includes 'unrated'; otherwise, 'maybe' is printed while `unrated` is False.***
