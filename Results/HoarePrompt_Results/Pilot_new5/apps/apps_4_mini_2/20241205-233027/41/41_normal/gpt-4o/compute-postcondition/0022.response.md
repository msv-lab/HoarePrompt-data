According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, which is already satisfied since it is stated that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

Since `is_rated` is False, this indicates that all pairs (a, b) have a = b, but this does not impact the execution of the loop directly. The variables `ratings` and `is_unrated` also do not affect whether the loop can execute based on the current state.

Thus, the relevant states are:
- `n` is valid for the loop to execute.
- `i` is initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `i` is 1**
