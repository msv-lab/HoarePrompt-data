Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1001; `ratings` contains the original tuples plus the new tuple (a, b); `is_rated` is True; `is_unrated` is False; `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the state remains as described, allowing for further operations based on the condition.***
