You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----
Input
6
3060 3060
2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input
4
1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input
5
3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
