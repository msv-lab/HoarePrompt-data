Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers; `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers; `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`; `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`; `rated` is False; `unrated` is False; `maybe` is True; `i` is 0; `j` is `n-1`. If `unrated` is False, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the variables unchanged. If `unrated` is True, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
