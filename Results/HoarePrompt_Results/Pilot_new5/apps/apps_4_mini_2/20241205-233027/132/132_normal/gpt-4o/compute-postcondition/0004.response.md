The variable `total_y` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `y`. The initial state indicates that `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, but we do not know the specific values of `y`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `total_x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input where each element x_i satisfies 0 <= x_i <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input; `total_x` is the sum of the elements in `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the elements in `y`.**
