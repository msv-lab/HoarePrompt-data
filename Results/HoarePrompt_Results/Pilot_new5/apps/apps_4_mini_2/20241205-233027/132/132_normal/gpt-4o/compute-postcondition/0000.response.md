The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` will now hold a specific integer value that must still satisfy the condition 1 <= n <= 50. The lists `x` and `y` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of n non-negative integers where each element x_i satisfies 0 <= x_i <= 1000; `y` is a list of n non-negative integers where each element y_i satisfies 0 <= y_i <= 1000; `n` is an input integer.**
