`x` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by whitespace. The input will consist of `n` integers, which are the number of stones in each pile during the first visit. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it still represents the count of piles. The output state will reflect the updated value of `x` as a list of integers representing the stones in piles.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 50`; `x` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in pile `i` during the first visit.**
