The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) and two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` non-negative integers (0 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000). It calculates the sum of the integers in both lists and prints 'No' if the sum of list `y` is greater than the sum of list `x`, otherwise it prints 'Yes'. There are no return values, and the function relies on user input for the lists.
