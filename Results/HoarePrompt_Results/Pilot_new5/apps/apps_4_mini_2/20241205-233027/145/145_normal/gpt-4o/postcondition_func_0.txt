The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `ticket` consisting of `n` digits (each between 0 and 9). It checks if the string can be divided into multiple segments, each having an equal sum. If such segments exist with a count greater than one, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where no segments sum to zero or where the string might not be divisible into valid segments based on the segment lengths.
