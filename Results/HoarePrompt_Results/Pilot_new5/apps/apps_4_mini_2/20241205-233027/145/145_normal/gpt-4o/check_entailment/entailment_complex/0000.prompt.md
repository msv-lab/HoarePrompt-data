You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and ticket is a string of n digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`, and `segment_length` is `n - 1`. If all digits in `ticket` sum up to `target_sum`, then `segment_count` must be greater than 1 for the output to be 'YES'. If no segments match `target_sum`, then `current_sum` must not be equal to 0 or `segment_count` must be less than or equal to 1.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO' based on the conditions outlined for `segment_count`, `current_sum`, and `target_sum`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `ticket` consisting of `n` digits (each between 0 and 9). It checks if the string can be divided into multiple segments, each having an equal sum. If such segments exist with a count greater than one, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where no segments sum to zero or where the string might not be divisible into valid segments based on the segment lengths.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of digits of length n where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each digit a_i is an integer between 0 and 9. start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end < n.
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits in the string 'ticket' from index 'start' to index 'end', inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `segment_sum` accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `start` and `end`, and returns the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end`, inclusive. It is important to note that the function may not handle cases where `start` and `end` are out of bounds or if `ticket` is not defined in the function's scope, which could lead to a NameError.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
