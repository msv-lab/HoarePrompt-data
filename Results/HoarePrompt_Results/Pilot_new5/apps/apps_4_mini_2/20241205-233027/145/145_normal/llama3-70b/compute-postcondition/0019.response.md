In this case, `curr_sum` is updated by adding the value of `digit`, which is the third character of `ticket`. Since `ticket` is a string of digits, `digit` can be converted to an integer for the addition. The previous value of `curr_sum` is 0, so after the operation `curr_sum += digit`, `curr_sum` will be equal to the integer value of `digit`.

The other variables remain unchanged, and we can specify that `curr_sum` will now hold the value of the third digit in the `ticket` string.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 3, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is equal to the integer value of the third character of `ticket`, `segments` is increased to 2, `digit` is the third character of `ticket`.**
