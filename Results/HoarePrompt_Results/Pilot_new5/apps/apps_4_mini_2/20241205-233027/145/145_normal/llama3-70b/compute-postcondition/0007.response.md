According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `ticket`. Since `ticket` is guaranteed to have a length between 2 and 100, the loop will execute as long as `ticket` is not empty. Given that `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is computed as `total_sum // 2`, and `curr_sum` starts at 0, the loop will set `digit` to the first character of `ticket` in the first iteration.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `ticket` must contain at least 2 digits, and `digit` will be the first character of `ticket` during the first iteration.

State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 0, `digit` is the first character of `ticket`**
