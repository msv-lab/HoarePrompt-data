Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket` modulo `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the number of times `current_sum` reached `target_sum` during the iteration over the digits of `ticket`. Either `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1.***
