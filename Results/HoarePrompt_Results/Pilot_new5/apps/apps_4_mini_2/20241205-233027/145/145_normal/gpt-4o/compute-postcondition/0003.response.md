The variable `segment_count` is assigned the value of 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `ticket` is a string of n digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, and `segment_count` is 0.
