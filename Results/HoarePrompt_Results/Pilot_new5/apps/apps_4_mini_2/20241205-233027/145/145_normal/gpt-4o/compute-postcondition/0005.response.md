The value of `current_sum` is incremented by the integer value of the digit at index `i` in the `ticket` string. The previous value of `current_sum` is 0, and `i` is 0, so we will add the integer value of the first digit of `ticket` to `current_sum`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `ticket` is a string of n digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `ticket` is a string of n digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0.**
