According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, we also need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2**
