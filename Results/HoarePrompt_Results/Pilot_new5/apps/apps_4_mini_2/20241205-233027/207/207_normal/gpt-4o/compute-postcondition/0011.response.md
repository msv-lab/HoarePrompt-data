The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`. The parameter `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), while `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100000\). 

The return value of the function is determined by the following cases:

- **Case 1**: If \(g\), returned by `func_1(a, b)`, is not equal to 1, the function returns the result of `func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g)` multiplied by \(g\).
  
- **Case 2**: If \(m\) is less than \(k\) (where \(k = a + b - 1\)), the function returns the result of the formula \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\).

- **Case 3**: If none of the previous cases are fulfilled, the function returns the sum of `sum_k` (the sum of the first \(k\) integers) and `sum_m` (the sum of the first \(m\) integers minus the sum of the first \((k-1)\) integers).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three parameters: a positive integer `m`, and positive integers `a` and `b`. Based on the conditions defined in the cases, it returns a value either derived from a recursive call multiplied by \(g\), a specific formula based on \(m\), or a sum of integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters m, a, and b, and based on certain conditions returns either a modified recursive result, a specific formula result, or a sum of integers.**
