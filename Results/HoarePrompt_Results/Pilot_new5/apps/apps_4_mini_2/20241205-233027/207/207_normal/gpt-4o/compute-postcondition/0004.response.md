The value of `k` is assigned the result of the expression `a + b - 1`. Given that `a` and `b` are both positive integers within their respective bounds, the value of `k` will also be calculated. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 100000; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 100000; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 100000; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 100000; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.**
