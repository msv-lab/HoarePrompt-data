The function accepts three positive integers, `m`, `a`, and `b`, from user input and computes the number of distinct ways to reach a total of `m` by either adding `a` or subtracting `b` in each step. It returns the sum of all ways to reach each index from 0 to `m`, where the initial state has one way (starting at 0). If `m` is less than `a` or less than `b`, it appropriately handles those cases by ensuring that indices remain within valid bounds. The function does not explicitly return a value; instead, it prints the computed sum.
