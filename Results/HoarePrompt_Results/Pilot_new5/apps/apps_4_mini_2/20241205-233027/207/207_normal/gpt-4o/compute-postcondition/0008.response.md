The variable `sum_k` is computed as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The value of `k` is `a + b - 1`, and since `a` and `b` are both positive integers within their respective ranges, `k` is also a positive integer. Therefore, `sum_k` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 100000; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 100000; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; `m` is greater than or equal to `k`; `sum_k` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`.**
