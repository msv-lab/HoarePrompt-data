To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to examine whether the program effectively calculates the sum of the distinct integers the frog can reach for all positions from `0` to `m`.

### Analysis of the Problem Description:
1. The frog starts at position `0` and can jump forward by `a` or jump backward by `b`.
2. The function `f(x)` determines the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the range `[0, x]`.
3. The goal is to compute the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Examination of the Program:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` computes the GCD of two numbers, and `func_2` calculates the required sum based on the inputs `m`, `a`, and `b`.

#### `func_1`:
- The GCD calculation is correct, and it's necessary for simplifying the problem when `a` and `b` have common factors.

#### `func_2`:
- The program first checks if `g` (the GCD of `a` and `b`) is not equal to 1. If so, it recursively calls `func_2` with the scaled-down parameters. This step ensures that we reduce the problem to its simplest form.
- The next condition checks if `m` is less than `k = a + b - 1`. If it is, it calculates the sum of the first `m` integers, which is correct because for small values of `m`, the frog can only reach the integers within `[0, m]`.
- Finally, when `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the potential number of reachable integers by using the sums of the first `k` and `m` integers. This is based on the fact that the frog can jump in a pattern dictated by `a` and `b`.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly handles cases when `m` is small and when the jumps have a GCD greater than 1 (by reducing the problem).
- It correctly computes the sum of reachable integers based on the specified jumping rules and ensures that the range limitations are respected.
- The calculations performed in `func_2` seem consistent with the need to account for numbers reachable from `0` to `m`.

### Conclusion:
After thorough analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and correctly computes the sum for all `i` from `0` to `m`. Therefore, it meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
