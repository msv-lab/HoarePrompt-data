Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. It uses the result of `func_1(a, b)` to determine whether to recursively call itself with scaled-down values of `m`, `a`, and `b` if `g` (the output of `func_1`) is not equal to 1. If `m` is less than `k` (where `k` is `a + b - 1`), it returns the triangular number formula for `m`. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates and returns the sum of the first `k` integers and the sum of integers from `k` to `m`. The function does not handle potential edge cases related to the behavior of `func_1` and assumes it will always return a value that allows for valid computations in all cases. **
