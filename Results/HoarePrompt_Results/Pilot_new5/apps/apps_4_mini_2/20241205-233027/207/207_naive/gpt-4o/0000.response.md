To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func_2` function.

### Problem Breakdown
The frog can jump from position `k` either to `k + a` or to `k - b`, within the bounds of `[0, x]`. We need to compute `f(x)` which is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach from the starting position `0` to `x`, and then compute the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Logic:**
   The code first calculates the GCD of `a` and `b` to determine if the jumping behavior can be simplified. If `g = func_1(a, b)` is greater than `1`, the function recursively reduces `m`, `a`, and `b` by dividing by `g`. This is logically sound, as the frog could only reach positions that are multiples of `g`.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   In the case where `m < k` (where `k = a + b - 1`), the program correctly computes the sum of the first `m` integers. The expression `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2` correctly computes the count of reachable integers from `0` to `m`.

3. **When `m >= k`:**
   The program calculates the sum of positions reachable using the formula for the triangular numbers. It distinguishes between the numbers below and above `k` and sums them appropriately.

### Potential Case to Consider
What if `a` and `b` are such that they enable jumps that effectively allow the frog to reach every integer? For example, if we have small values for `a` and `b` that are coprime (such as `a = 1` and `b = 2`), the frog can reach every integer from `0` upwards indefinitely, leading to different behaviors compared to larger `a` and `b`.

However, the function is designed to handle cases with both large and small `m`, `a`, `b`. Given the problem constraints (`1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^5`), we need to assess whether the implementation accounts for all possible cases, especially when `a` or `b` is significantly larger than the other.

### Conclusion 
The program seems complex but accounts for the core logic needed to determine reachable positions based on the given rules. The recursive GCD reduction is a clever way to simplify the jumps, and the calculations for sums appear to be accurate based on the problem description.

After careful consideration, I cannot find a case where the provided code fails to adhere to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
