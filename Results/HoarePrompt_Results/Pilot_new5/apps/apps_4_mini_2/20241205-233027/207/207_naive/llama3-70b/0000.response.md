Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval \([0, x]\) for each \(x\) from \(0\) to \(m\). 

1. In the program, the logic used to fill the `dp` array is incorrect:
   - The line `dp[i - b]` is not being updated correctly. Instead of counting reachable positions based on jumps of size \(b\) correctly, it attempts to update the current position \(i\) based on \(i - b\), which does not reflect the number of distinct reachable positions.
   
2. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case when potential jumps go out of bounds, particularly for large values of \(m\). 

3. The logic of summing the values in the `dp` array does not account for distinct integers correctly due to the faulty updating of positions in `dp`.

For example, consider the input \(m = 6\), \(a = 4\), \(b = 5\):
- The expected values of \(f(i)\) would be:
  - \(f(0) = 1\)
  - \(f(1) = 1\)
  - \(f(2) = 1\)
  - \(f(3) = 1\)
  - \(f(4) = 1\)
  - \(f(5) = 3\) (0, 4, 5)
  - \(f(6) = 3\) (0, 4, 5)
  
  The expected output should sum these values to \(10\). 

However, because of the program's flawed logic, it would produce an incorrect output. Thus, the program fails to meet the problem's requirements.
