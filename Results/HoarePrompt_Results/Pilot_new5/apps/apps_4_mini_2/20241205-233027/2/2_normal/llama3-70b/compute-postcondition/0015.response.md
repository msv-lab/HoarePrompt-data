`digit_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the digits of `i`. Given that `i` is 3, the sum of its digits will be 3. Therefore, `digit_sum` will change from 2 to 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2**
