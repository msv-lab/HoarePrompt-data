The variable `digit_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the digits of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `str(i)` converts `i` to the string "2", and the sum of its digits (which is just 2) is calculated. Therefore, `digit_sum` will be updated from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 1**
