The code calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `i`, which is currently 1. The value of `digit_sum` is now determined by summing the integer value of each digit in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is 1, the only digit is '1'. Thus, `digit_sum` will be 1.

The other variable `x` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `i` is 1; `digit_sum` is 1**
