`max_num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 3. Therefore, `max_num` will now also be 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `digit_sum` is 3; `max_sum` is 3; `max_num` is 3.**
