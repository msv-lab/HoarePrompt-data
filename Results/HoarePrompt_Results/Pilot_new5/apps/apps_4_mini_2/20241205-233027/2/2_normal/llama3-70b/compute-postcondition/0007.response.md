`max_num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `i` is 1; `digit_sum` is 1; `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum` which is 1; `max_num` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `i` is 1; `digit_sum` is 1; `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum` which is 1; `max_num` is 1.**
