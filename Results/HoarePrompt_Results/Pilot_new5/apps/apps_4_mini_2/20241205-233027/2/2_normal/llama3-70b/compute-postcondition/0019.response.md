To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates from 1 to `x`, and for each iteration, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current number `i`. It updates `max_sum` and `max_num` whenever a new maximum digit sum is found.

The loop will continue executing until it reaches `x`, and since `x` is a positive integer, the loop will have executed `x` times.

1. The maximum sum of digits occurs at `i` equal to `9`, `18`, `27`, ..., where the digit sums peak.
2. The maximum digit sum for any number `i` can be determined as follows:
   - For one-digit numbers (1 to 9), the maximum is 9.
   - For two-digit numbers (10 to 99), it can be 18 (from `99`).
   - For three-digit numbers (100 to 999), it can be 27 (from `999`).
   - This pattern continues where for a number with `k` digits, the maximum digit sum can be `9 * k`.

Since `max_sum` and `max_num` will be updated whenever a new maximum digit sum is found throughout the iterations:

- If `x` is 1, then `max_sum` will be 1 and `max_num` will be 1.
- If `x` is 2, then `max_sum` will be 2 and `max_num` will be 2.
- If `x` is 3, then `max_sum` will be 3 and `max_num` will be 3.
- ...
- If `x` is 9, then `max_sum` will be 9 and `max_num` will be 9.
- If `x` is 10 or greater, `max_sum` will become 10 at `i = 19`, and subsequently will continue to increase with larger values of `x`.

Ultimately, after all iterations of the loop, the final states of `max_sum` and `max_num` depend on the value of `x`:

If `x` is a two-digit number, for example, let’s say `x = 99`, the max digit sum will be 18 (from `99`), and thus `max_num` would be `99`.

If `x` is a large integer up to `10^18`, the maximum digit sum will still follow the aforementioned pattern.

Given this understanding, we can finalize that after all iterations of the loop, `max_sum` will represent the maximum possible digit sum calculated from numbers 1 through `x`, and `max_num` will reflect the number that produced this maximum sum.

Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum digit sum from numbers 1 to `x`, `max_num` is the number that produces `max_sum`, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18.**
