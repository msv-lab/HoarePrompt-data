According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus `i` will become 2. 

As `digit_sum` is currently 1, it was also determined that `max_sum` is 1 and `max_num` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration. There are no constraints affecting `digit_sum`, `max_sum`, or `max_num` at this point relative to the loop execution.

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 1, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 1**
