According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. The provided state indicates that `heap` contains `n * m` tuples, which implies that `n` and `m` must be positive integers, but doesn't provide a direct influence on the loop execution. The variable `total_coverage` is stated to be 0, which does not affect the loop execution either.

For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is a positive integer. 

State: **`heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` in the range `0` to `n - 1` and `y` in the range `0` to `m - 1`; `n` and `m` must be positive integers; `total_coverage` is 0; `k` must be greater than 0.**
