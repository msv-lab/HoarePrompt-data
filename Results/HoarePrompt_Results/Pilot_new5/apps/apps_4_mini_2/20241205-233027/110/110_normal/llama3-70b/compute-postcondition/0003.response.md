The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. All four parameters are positive integers, where `n` and `m` represent the dimensions of the pond, `r` represents the size of the scoop, and `k` represents the number of fishes to be placed. The constraints are that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 100000). The function's output is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that it performs some operations based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, where n and m are the dimensions of the pond, r is the size of the scoop, and k is the number of fishes to be placed, all of which are positive integers within specified constraints.**
