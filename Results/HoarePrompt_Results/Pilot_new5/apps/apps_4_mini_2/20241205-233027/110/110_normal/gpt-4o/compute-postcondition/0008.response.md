The loop executes `m` times, where `y` takes values from `0` to `m-1`. In each iteration, a tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` is pushed onto the `heap`, which builds up a collection of these tuples based on the current values of `x` and `y`. 

After all iterations of the loop have completed, the following holds true:

- `heap` contains `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for all values of `y` from `0` to `m-1`.
- `x` remains `0` throughout the loop as there are no modifications to it.
- `y` will be equal to `m`, which is the loop's termination condition.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`heap` contains `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` in the range `0` to `m-1`; `x` is 0; `y` is `m`.**
