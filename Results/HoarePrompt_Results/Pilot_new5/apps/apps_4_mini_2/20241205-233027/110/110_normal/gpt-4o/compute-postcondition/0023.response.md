The `heapq.heappush` function is used to push a new tuple onto the heap. In this case, the tuple consists of `-coverage(x, y)`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are both 2, and we need to determine the value of `coverage(x, y)` for the new tuple.

The function will push the tuple `(-coverage(2, 2), 2, 2)` onto the heap. The state of the `heap` will include the new tuple along with its previous values.

The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged based on the information given in the initial state.

Output State: **`heap` contains `2m + 1 + 1` tuples, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and the new tuple `(-coverage(2, 2), 2, 2)` has been added to the `heap`.**
