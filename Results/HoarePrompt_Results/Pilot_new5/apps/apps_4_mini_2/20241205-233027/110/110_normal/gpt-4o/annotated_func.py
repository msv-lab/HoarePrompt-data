#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond, r is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop, and k is a positive integer representing the number of distinct fishes to be placed in the pond such that k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5).
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each `x` in the range `0` to `n - 1` and `y` in the range `0` to `m - 1`; `n` and `m` must be positive integers.
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `heap` contains `n * m - k` tuples of the form `(-coverage(a, b), a, b)` for `a` in the range `0` to `n - 1` and `b` in the range `0` to `m - 1`; `total_coverage` is equal to the sum of the coverage values of the `k` popped tuples; `k` must be less than or equal to `n * m`.
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the average coverage per position, calculated as total_coverage divided by total_positions, where total_coverage is the sum of the coverage values of the k popped tuples and total_positions is equal to (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four positive integer parameters: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), `r` (size of the scoop), and `k` (number of distinct fishes). It calculates the total coverage by summing the coverage values of the `k` most covered positions in a grid defined by `n` and `m`, and then returns the average coverage per position based on the total coverage divided by the total number of valid positions for the scoop, which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. If `k` exceeds the total positions in the grid, it could lead to an error since the number of fishes should not exceed `n * m`. The function does not explicitly handle this edge case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing cell coordinates within a rectangular pond of size n × m, where 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m; n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond; r is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net such that r <= min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns the area of the scoop-net's coverage on the pond, calculated using the coordinates (x, y), dimensions (n, m), and scoop-net size (r).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, representing cell coordinates in a rectangular pond of size `n × m`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net. It returns the area of the scoop-net's coverage based on the provided coordinates, dimensions, and scoop-net size, but it assumes that the variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are defined elsewhere in the code. If any of these variables are not properly defined or passed into the function, it could lead to an error or incorrect output.
