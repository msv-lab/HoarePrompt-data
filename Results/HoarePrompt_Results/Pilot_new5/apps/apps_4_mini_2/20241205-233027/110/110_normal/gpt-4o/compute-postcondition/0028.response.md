The code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes and returns the smallest item from the `heap`, which is a tuple of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. This means that `cov` will be assigned the negative coverage of the specific `(x, y)` coordinates that were at the top of the heap, and `x` and `y` will be assigned their respective values from that tuple. The heap will now contain one less tuple, and `total_coverage`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state should reflect the new values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` based on the operation of popping from the heap.

Output State: **`heap` contains `n * m - 1` tuples of the form `(-coverage(a, b), a, b)` for `a` in the range `0` to `n - 1` and `b` in the range `0` to `m - 1`, `total_coverage` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `cov` is `-coverage(x, y)`, `x` is the x-coordinate popped from the heap, `y` is the y-coordinate popped from the heap**.
