The code snippet uses the `heapq.heappush` function to add a new tuple to the `heap`. The tuple being pushed is `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, where `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. The function `coverage(x, y)` is called with these values. The result of `coverage(1, 1)` will be negated before being pushed to the heap.

Given that `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, we can denote the value of `coverage(1, 1)` as `coverage_value`. Consequently, the tuple added to `heap` will be `(-coverage_value, 1, 1)`.

The other variables' states remain unchanged, as they are unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`heap` contains `m + 1` tuples and now includes `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1.**
