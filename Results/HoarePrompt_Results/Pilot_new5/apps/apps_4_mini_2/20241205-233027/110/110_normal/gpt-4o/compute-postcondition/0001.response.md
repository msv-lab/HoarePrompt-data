The function `coverage` accepts parameters `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers representing cell coordinates within a rectangular pond of size `n Ã— m`. The parameters `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond, and `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net such that `r` is less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`. After executing the function body, it returns the area of the scoop-net's coverage on the pond, calculated using the coordinates `(x, y)`, dimensions `(n, m)`, and scoop-net size `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y as non-negative integers representing coordinates within a pond, and it returns the area of the scoop-net's coverage based on the specified dimensions of the pond and the size of the scoop-net.**
