The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It merely skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 2 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
