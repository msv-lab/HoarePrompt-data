The code `right_count[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `right_count` by 1. The variable `i` is currently 0, so the value at `right_count[0]` will be increased by 1. The other variables, `d`, `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `i` is 0; `sofas` is a list with at least 1 element; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`; `right_count[0]` is increased by 1.**
