The value of `left` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `left` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state is that `sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `s` is the second tuple in the list, and `left` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `s` is the second tuple in the list, and `left` is increased by 1.**
