Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements. The current value of `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and the current value of `y2` is also greater than `y2_j`. The variable `bottom_count[i]` has been incremented by 1, while `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged. If `y1` was previously less than `y1_j` and `y2` was also less than `y1_j`, those conditions are no longer applicable after this change.***
