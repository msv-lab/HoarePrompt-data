`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned values based on the input provided, which is processed as integers through the `map(int, input().strip().split())` function. The list `sofas` is updated to include the new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. The values of `d`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**.
