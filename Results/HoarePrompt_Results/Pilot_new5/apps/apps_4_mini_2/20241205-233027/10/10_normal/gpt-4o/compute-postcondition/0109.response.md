Postcondition: ***`d` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `right_count[2]`, `left_count[2]`, `bottom_count[2]`, `top_count[2]` are defined, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`, `j` is initialized to 0, and the current value of `i` is equal to the current value of `j`, which is 0.***
