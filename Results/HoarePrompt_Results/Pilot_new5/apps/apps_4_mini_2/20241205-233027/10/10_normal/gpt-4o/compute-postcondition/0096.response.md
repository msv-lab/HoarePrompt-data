The line of code `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]` assigns the values from the `sofas` list at index `j` (which is `2`) to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. The initial state indicates that `sofas` has at least `d` elements, and since `d` is greater than or equal to 3, it means that index `j` (which is `2`) is valid.

The specific values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will depend on the contents of `sofas[2]`, which are not provided. Therefore, we cannot specify their values.

The states of the other variables `d`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`d` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 2, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`.**
