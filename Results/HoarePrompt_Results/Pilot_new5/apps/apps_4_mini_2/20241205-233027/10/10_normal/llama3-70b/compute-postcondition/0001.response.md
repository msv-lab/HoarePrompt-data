To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

In the program state, we have:

- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `sofas` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2).
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1.
- `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are all initialized to 0.

The loop iterates over each element in the `sofas` list. For the loop to execute, `sofas` must contain at least one tuple. 

Here is the analysis:

1. The loop will execute if the `sofas` list has at least one element.
2. If `sofas` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Thus, the adjustments needed before the loop starts are:

- Ensure that `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple.
- The variables `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` do not need to change in this context unless specified by the loop body.

State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples that must contain at least 1 tuple**
