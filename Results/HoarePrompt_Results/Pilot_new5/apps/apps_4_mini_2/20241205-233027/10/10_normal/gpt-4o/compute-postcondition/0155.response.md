The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `d` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, `target_sofa` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
