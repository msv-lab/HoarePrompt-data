Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple. If the current tuple `s` is not equal to `sofa` and the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` while the second elements are equal, then `top` has been increased by 1, with `left`, `right`, and `bottom` remaining unchanged. If this condition is not met, `top`, `left`, `right`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.***
