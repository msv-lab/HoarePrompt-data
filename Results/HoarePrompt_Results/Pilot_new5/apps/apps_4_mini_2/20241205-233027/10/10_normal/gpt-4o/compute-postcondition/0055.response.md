The code `left_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is 0, meaning we are affecting `left_count[0]`. The values of `d`, `sofas`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged since they are not directly influenced by this operation.

Therefore, the updated state is simply that `left_count[0]` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `sofas` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`, and `left_count[0]` is increased by 1.**
