The `sofas` list is updated to include a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. Since `sofas` already contains previous tuples, the new state of the `sofas` list will consist of all previous tuples plus the newly added tuple. The values of `d`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and `sofas` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**.
