The code `continue` does not change any variable values or state but causes the current iteration of a loop to skip to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `d` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`, and the current loop iteration is skipped.

Output State: **`d` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
