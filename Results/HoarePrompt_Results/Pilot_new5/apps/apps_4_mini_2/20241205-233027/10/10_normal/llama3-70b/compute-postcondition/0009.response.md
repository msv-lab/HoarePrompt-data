Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple; the current tuple `s` is not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `left` has been increased by 1 and `right` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged and `right` remains unchanged. The first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is not less than the first element of the first tuple in `s`, and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`.***
