The `continue` statement is used within loops to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one. In this case, the variables `d`, `i`, `sofas`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and the relationship between `i` and `j` remain unchanged, except that the current loop iteration is skipped. Therefore, the output state is: `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `sofas` is a list that has at least 1 element, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas` at index 0, the current value of `i` is equal to `j`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `sofas` is a list that has at least 1 element; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas` at index 0; the current value of `i` is equal to `j`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
