Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and `top_count[i]` is also incremented by 1, while `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged. If the condition is not met, `bottom_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
