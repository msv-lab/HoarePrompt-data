According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sofas` list. If the list contains additional tuples beyond the current one, the loop can execute again for the next tuple. At the end of the last iteration, since `sofas` is stated to have at least one tuple, there must be a current tuple `s` being processed. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `s` should move to the next tuple in the list. Assuming the current tuple `s` is the first tuple, the next tuple will be the second one in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `sofas` must contain at least two tuples. Thus, the state needs to indicate that `s` will be the next tuple in the sequence.

State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `s` is the second tuple in the list**
