The line of code assigns values to `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` by mapping the input values (split into integers) to these variables. The initial state does not provide specific values for `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`, so we can only state that they will be updated based on the input.

Therefore, the output state maintains the previous values of `d`, `n`, `m`, and `sofas`, but updates `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` to the integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples where each tuple represents the coordinates of a sofa in the format `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, and `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers.**
