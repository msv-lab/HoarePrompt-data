The code appends a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. The previous states of `d`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, while `sofas` now contains an additional tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. 

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
