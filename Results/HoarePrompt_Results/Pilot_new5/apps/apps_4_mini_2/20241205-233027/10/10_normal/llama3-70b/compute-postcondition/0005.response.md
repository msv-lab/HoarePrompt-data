Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, the current tuple `s` is not equal to `sofa`, if the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `left` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged.***
