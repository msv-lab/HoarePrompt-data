Postcondition: ***`d` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `right_count[2]`, `left_count[2]`, `bottom_count[2]`, `top_count[2]` are defined, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`, `j` is initialized to 0. If `i` is equal to `j`, the loop will continue to the next iteration, and `i` remains 2 while `j` is still 0.***
