The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, which are read from standard input with the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. It calculates and prints the result of the expression ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2), which effectively computes the number of ways to distribute the difference between `x` and `y` into pairs, considering any remaining single unit when the difference is odd.
