The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` to `px` and `py`, respectively. The initial conditional check regarding the sum of absolute differences does not alter the values since this snippet does not involve any return or modification of `n`, `a`, or `v`. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` remain unchanged but are now assigned to `px` and `py`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignments without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `v` is the second integer in the list `a`, `px` is assigned the value of `nx`, `py` is assigned the value of `ny`**.
