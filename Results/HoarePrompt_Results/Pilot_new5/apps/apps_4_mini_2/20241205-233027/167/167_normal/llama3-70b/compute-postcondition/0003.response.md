Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `v` is the first integer in the list `a`, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that the sum of the absolute differences, abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py), is not equal to 1.***
