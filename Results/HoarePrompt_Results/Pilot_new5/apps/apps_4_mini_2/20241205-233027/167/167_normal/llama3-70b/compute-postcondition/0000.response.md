The variables `px` and `py` are assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9, `px` is 0, `py` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9, `px` is 0, `py` is 0**.
