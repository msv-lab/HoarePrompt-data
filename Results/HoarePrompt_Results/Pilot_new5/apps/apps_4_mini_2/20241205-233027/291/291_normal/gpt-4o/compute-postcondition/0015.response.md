The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, the program returns the minimum segments needed based on the calculations performed, reflecting the result of the calculations involving 'a', 'b', and 'segments_needed'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the minimum segments needed based on specific calculations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns the minimum segments needed based on calculations performed involving 'a', 'b', and 'segments_needed'.**
