The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 10^9) and computes the minimum number of segments needed based on the calculations involving the factors `a` and `b`. It iterates over possible values of `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`, calculating `b` as the ceiling of `n/a`, and then computes the segments needed as `2 * (a + b)`. The function ultimately returns the minimum segments required, which effectively reflects the optimal way to partition the integer `n` into segments.
