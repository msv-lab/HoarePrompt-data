def func_1(n):

        b = (n + a - 1) // a

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `min_segments_needed` is the minimum segments needed based on the calculations performed, `a` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `b` is equal to `(n + a - 1) // a` for the last value of `a`, and `segments_needed` is equal to `2 * (a + b)` for the last value of `a`.
    return min_segments_needed
    #The program returns the minimum segments needed based on the calculations performed, reflecting the result of the calculations involving 'a', 'b', and 'segments_needed'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 10^9) and computes the minimum number of segments needed based on the calculations involving the factors `a` and `b`. It iterates over possible values of `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`, calculating `b` as the ceiling of `n/a`, and then computes the segments needed as `2 * (a + b)`. The function ultimately returns the minimum segments required, which effectively reflects the optimal way to partition the integer `n` into segments.
