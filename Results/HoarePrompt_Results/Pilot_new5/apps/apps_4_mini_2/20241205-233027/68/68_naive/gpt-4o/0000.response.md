Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle all possible edge cases correctly. Specifically, consider the case when \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and \( z = 0 \). The expected output should be "0", as there are no upvotes or downvotes. However, the program would output "?" since both the maximum upvotes and downvotes are equal to 0, leading to uncertainty. 

Thus, this case demonstrates that the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
