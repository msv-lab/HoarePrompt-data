The code executes a print statement that outputs the character '+', but it does not modify any of the variable states. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationship between `x`, `y`, and `z`, specifically that `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, still hold true. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `x` is greater than `y + z`; output is '+'**
