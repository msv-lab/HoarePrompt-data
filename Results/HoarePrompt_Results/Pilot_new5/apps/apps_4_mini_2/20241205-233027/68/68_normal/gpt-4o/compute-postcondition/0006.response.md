The code `print('-')` outputs a string and does not modify any of the variables. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the unchanged variables and the action performed by the print statement.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on input values within the range of 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; and the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`.**
