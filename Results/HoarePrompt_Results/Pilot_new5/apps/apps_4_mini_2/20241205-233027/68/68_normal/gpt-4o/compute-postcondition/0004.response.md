The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value `y + z`. The initial state indicates `y` is an integer within the range of 0 to 100, and `z` is also an integer within the same range. Therefore, `max_downvotes` is also an integer that can take values between `0 + 0` (if both `y` and `z` are 0) and `100 + 100` (if both are 100), resulting in a range of 0 to 200. The states of `x`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on input values within the range of 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
