To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the description and the code.

### Problem Summary:
1. We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. Depending on the values of these integers:
   - If more upvotes than downvotes, output "+".
   - If more downvotes than upvotes, output "-".
   - If they are equal, output "0".
   - If `z` can influence the outcome such that both "+" and "-" are possible, output "?".
   
### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the integers `x`, `y`, and `z` correctly from the input.
2. **Calculating Min/Max Upvotes and Downvotes**:
   - `min_upvotes = x`: Minimum upvotes is the known upvotes.
   - `max_upvotes = x + z`: Maximum possible upvotes is the known upvotes plus all unknown votes.
   - `min_downvotes = y`: Minimum downvotes is the known downvotes.
   - `max_downvotes = y + z`: Maximum possible downvotes is the known downvotes plus all unknown votes.
3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`: This means even at maximum upvotes, downvotes will always be higher, hence the output is "-".
   - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`: This means even at maximum downvotes, upvotes will always be higher, hence the output is "+".
   - In all other cases, it means the result is uncertain because the unknown votes can swing the result either way, hence the output is "?".

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description:
- The conditions in the program cover all scenarios described in the problem:
  - When upvotes are definitively less than downvotes, it outputs "-".
  - When upvotes are definitively more than downvotes, it outputs "+".
  - When the upvotes and downvotes can potentially be equal or undetermined due to `z`, it outputs "?".
  
### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in the program directly corresponds to the requirements set forth in the problem description. It handles all edge cases correctly, including situations with zero votes.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
