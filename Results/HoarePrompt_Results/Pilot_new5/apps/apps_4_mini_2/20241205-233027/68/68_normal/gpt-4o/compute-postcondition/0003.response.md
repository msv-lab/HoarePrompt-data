The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The previous values of the variables `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, we can state the relationships based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on input values within the range of 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.**
