The function `func` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`. All three parameters are integers that must satisfy the constraint 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. After executing the function body, the behavior of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine the specific output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, each within the range of 0 to 100, but the return value and behavior based on these inputs are not defined in the provided output specification.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x, y, and z, which are integers within the range of 0 to 100. The specific return value is not defined.**
