The code snippet assigns values to `x`, `y`, and `z` by taking input and mapping it to these variables. The variables previously held integer values such that \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\). After running the code, the previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated based on the input provided. 

Since the specific input values are not provided, we denote the new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` as integers that will now hold the values resulting from the `map(int, input().split())` operation.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, with new values assigned from input.**
