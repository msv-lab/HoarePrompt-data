To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implemented logic.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `x`: Number of upvotes.
   - `y`: Number of downvotes.
   - `z`: Number of unknown votes (could be upvotes or downvotes).

2. **Outputs:**
   - If there are more upvotes than downvotes, output "+".
   - If there are more downvotes than upvotes, output "-".
   - If upvotes equal downvotes, the output is:
     - "0" if there are no unknown votes (`z == 0`).
     - "?" if there are unknown votes (`z > 0`).
   - If the results are uncertain due to unknown votes, output "?".
  
### Program Logic:
The logic in the program can be broken down as follows:
- If `x > y + z`, it means even if all unknown votes were downvotes, upvotes would still be greater. Therefore, it prints "+".
- If `x < y`, it means there's no way upvotes can equal or exceed downvotes, so it prints "-".
- If `x == y`, we check:
  - If `z == 0`, then the results are clear (both counts are equal), hence it prints "0".
  - If `z > 0`, there are unknown votes which create uncertainty, so it prints "?".
- Finally, the last `else` is not necessary since all cases have been handled.

### Analyzing Potential Cases:
Now, let's evaluate if there are any cases where the program fails to return the expected output:

1. **Case 1:** `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`
   - Expected: `-` (3 upvotes < 7 downvotes)
   - Program Output: `-` (Correct)

2. **Case 2:** `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - Expected: `+` (2 upvotes > 0 downvotes regardless of one unknown vote)
   - Program Output: `+` (Correct)

3. **Case 3:** `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
   - Expected: `0` (1 upvote = 1 downvote)
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Case 4:** `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - Expected: `?` (Uncertain since 1 unknown vote could be either upvote or downvote)
   - Program Output: `?` (Correct)

5. **Case 5:** `x = 5`, `y = 3`, `z = 2`
   - Expected: `+` (5 upvotes > 3 downvotes + 2 unknowns cannot change the outcome)
   - Program Output: `+` (Correct)

6. **Case 6:** `x = 3`, `y = 5`, `z = 1`
   - Expected: `-` (3 upvotes < 5 downvotes + 1 unknown)
   - Program Output: `-` (Correct)

7. **Case 7:** `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `z = 3`
   - Expected: `?` (With 3 unknown votes, it could swing either way)
   - Program Output: `?` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
All potential cases examined above return the expected results as per the problem description. The program correctly evaluates and handles all provided scenarios, including edge cases.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
