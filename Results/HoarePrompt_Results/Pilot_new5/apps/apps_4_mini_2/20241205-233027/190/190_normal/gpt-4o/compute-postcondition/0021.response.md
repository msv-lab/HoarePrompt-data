The `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `length - (t + 1)`. The variable `length` is currently set to `a[i + 1]`, and since `i + 1 < n`, `length` must be a valid integer in the list `a`. The value of `t` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so its value will affect the calculation of `current_cost`. However, since `current_cost` is being modified based on the expression involving `length` and `t`, we will express the change in terms of `current_cost`, `length`, and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is positive infinity; `best_t` is -1; `length` is `a[i + 1]` where `i + 1 < n`; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (a[i + 1] - (t + 1))`.**
