The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `current_cost`. Since `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, this means `min_cost` will now reflect the value of `current_cost`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `current_cost` is less than the previous `min_cost`, which is now equal to `current_cost`; `best_t` is 1; `length` is the last integer processed from list `a`.**
