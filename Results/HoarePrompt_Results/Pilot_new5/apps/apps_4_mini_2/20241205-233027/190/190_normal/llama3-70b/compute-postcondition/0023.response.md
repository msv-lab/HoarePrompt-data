Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is greater than 2, `i` is `mid - 1`, and `cost` is the calculated sum of minimum differences. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to equal `cost` and `min_t` is set to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, there are no changes to `min_cost` or `min_t`.***
