`min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects that `min_cost` now holds the same value as `cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is greater than 2, `i` is `mid - 1`, `cost` is the calculated sum of minimum differences, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
