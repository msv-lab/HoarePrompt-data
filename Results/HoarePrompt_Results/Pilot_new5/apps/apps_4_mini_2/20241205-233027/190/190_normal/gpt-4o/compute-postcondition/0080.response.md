The `print` function outputs the current values of `best_t` and `min_cost`, but it does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the values of `best_t` and `min_cost` are displayed, but the state of all variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated over all values of `t` from 1 to 100; `best_t` is the value of `t` that resulted in `min_cost`; `current_cost` is the cost calculated for the last value of `t`; `length` is the last integer processed from the list `a`; best_t is printed, min_cost is printed.**
