Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `length` is the second integer in the list `a`, and `t` is equal to 2. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated by adding `1 - length` to its previous value. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 3` to its previous value. No changes occur if `length` is equal to `t - 1` or `t + 1.`***
