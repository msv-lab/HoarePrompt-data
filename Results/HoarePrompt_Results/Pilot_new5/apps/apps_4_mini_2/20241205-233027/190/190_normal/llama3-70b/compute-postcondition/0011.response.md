The code assigns the value of `cost` to `min_cost`. Since the current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`, this means `min_cost` will now be equal to `cost`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is greater than 1, `i` is `mid - 1`, `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in `sticks`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
