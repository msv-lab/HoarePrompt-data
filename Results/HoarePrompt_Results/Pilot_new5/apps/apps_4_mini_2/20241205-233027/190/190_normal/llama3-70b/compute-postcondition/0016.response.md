The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `cost` is the sum of minimum distances between the elements in `sticks` and `i` and `i + 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `sticks`, `mid`, `i`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is greater than 2, `i` is `mid - 2`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
