Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is greater than 1, and `i` is `mid - 1`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `cost` and `min_t` is updated to be equal to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.***
