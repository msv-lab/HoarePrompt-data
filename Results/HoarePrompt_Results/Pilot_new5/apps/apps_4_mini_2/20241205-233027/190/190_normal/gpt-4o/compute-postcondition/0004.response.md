According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `t` in the range from 1 to 100. The loop will execute as long as the starting point of the range (1) is less than or equal to the ending point (101). Since there are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing based on the initial state, we can assume that the loop will indeed execute without requiring adjustments to the values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, or `best_t`.

At the start of the loop:
- `t` will begin at 1.
- The loop will continue to execute until `t` reaches 100.

Thus, there are no necessary adjustments to the provided state variables for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is set to positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1**
