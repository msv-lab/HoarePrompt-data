The `print` statement outputs the current values of `min_t` and `min_cost`. Given that the values of these variables have not been changed by the execution of the previous code (as `mid` is less than `100` and the loop executed), we can confirm that `min_t` and `min_cost` retain their last computed values from the loop execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is at least `1`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated across all `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that yielded `min_cost`, `i` is `101`, `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - 101), abs(x - 100)) for x in `sticks` at the last iteration, printed values are `min_t` and `min_cost`.**
