Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is at least `1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `3`, `i` is 3, `cost` is updated to the sum of min(abs(x - 3), abs(x - 2)) for x in `sticks`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost`, and `min_t` remains as `3`.***
