Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is at least `1`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated across all `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that yielded `min_cost`, `i` is `101` after the loop execution ends, and `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - 101), abs(x - 100)) for x in `sticks` at the last iteration, if `cost` was less than `min_cost` before the loop concluded, `min_cost` and `min_t` would have been updated accordingly. If `mid` is `100` or greater, then the loop does not execute and `min_cost` remains unchanged from its initial value, `min_t` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
