According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `t`, which takes values from 1 to 100 (inclusive). The loop will execute again if `t` can be incremented while still being within the range of these values. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is currently at its last value which is 1 less than the upper limit of the range. Therefore, the next value of `t` will be 2.

Since the loop can iterate up to 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be 2, and it has not reached the limit of 101 yet.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` remains unchanged, `length` is the last integer processed from list `a`, `t` is 2**
