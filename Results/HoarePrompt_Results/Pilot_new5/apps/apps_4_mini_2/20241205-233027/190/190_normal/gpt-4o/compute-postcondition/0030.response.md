The variable `current_cost` is initialized to 0, which means the previous value of `current_cost` is updated from whatever it was to 0. The other variables remain unchanged as their values are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `current_cost` is 0; `min_cost` is updated to the previous value of `current_cost`; `best_t` is set to 1; `t` is 2.**
