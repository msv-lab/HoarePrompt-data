The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to it. Given that `t` is 1 and `length` is `a[0]`, the expression simplifies to `current_cost += 1 - 1 - length`, which is `current_cost += -length`. Since the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1` (0), `length` is strictly greater than 0. Therefore, the new value of `current_cost` will be decreased by `length`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is set to positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost - length`, `length` is `a[0]`, and the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1` (0).**
