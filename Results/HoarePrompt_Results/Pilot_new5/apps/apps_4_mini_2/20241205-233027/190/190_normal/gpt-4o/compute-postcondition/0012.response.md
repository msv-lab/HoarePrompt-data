Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is set to positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 2` when `length` (which is `a[0]`) is greater than `t + 1` (i.e., greater than 2). If `length` is 3 or more, it satisfies the condition for updating `current_cost`, and `length` is ensured to be greater than or equal to 3.***
