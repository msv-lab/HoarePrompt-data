Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is updated to the previous value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is set to 1, `t` is 2, `length` is the first integer in list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), and the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1` (i.e., less than 1)***
