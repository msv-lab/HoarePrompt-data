Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, and `t` is equal to 2. If the length of `a` is less than 1, `current_cost` is updated by adding `1 - length`. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to 2, and if the length of `a` is greater than 3, `current_cost` is updated by adding `n - 3`.***
