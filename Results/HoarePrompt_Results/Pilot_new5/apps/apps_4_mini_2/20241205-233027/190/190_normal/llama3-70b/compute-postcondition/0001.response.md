The variable `sticks` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate strings. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of `n` integers. The value of `n` is updated to reflect the integer input, and `sticks` now contains `n` integers as well, which are derived from the input. 

Since the exact input for `sticks` is not specified, I will denote `sticks` as a list of integers that are provided via input, while `a` still retains its previous list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (updated to the integer value from input), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, `sticks` is a list of integers derived from input.**
