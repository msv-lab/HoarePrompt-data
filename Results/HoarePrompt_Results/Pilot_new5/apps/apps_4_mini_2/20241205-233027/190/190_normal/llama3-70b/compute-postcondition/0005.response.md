The variable `t` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is equal to `sticks[n // 2]`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from input, and `mid` is the middle element of `sticks`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `sticks` is the sorted list of integers derived from input; `mid` is equal to `sticks[n // 2]`; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and `mid`; `t` is equal to `mid`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `sticks` is the sorted list of integers derived from input; `mid` is equal to `sticks[n // 2]`; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and `mid`; `t` is equal to `mid`.**
