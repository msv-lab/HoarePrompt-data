To derive the output state, we analyze the impact of the given code snippet on the initial state:

1. The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to its previous value. 
2. The variable `length` is defined as `a[i + 1]`, where `i + 1 < n`. Therefore, `length` has a specific value from the list `a` that corresponds to the index `i + 1`.
3. The values of other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Thus, we summarize the output state by including the updated value of `current_cost` and the unchanged status of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is positive infinity; `best_t` is -1; `length` is `a[i + 1]` where `i + 1 < n`; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - a[i + 1]`.**
