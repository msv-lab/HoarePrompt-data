Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to find a stick length `t` such that all sticks can be adjusted to be "almost good" for `t`, while minimizing the total cost of adjustments. However, there is a logical flaw in the approach:

1. The program incorrectly calculates the costs based on `mid`, which is the median of the sticks. While the median is often a good starting point in minimizing absolute differences, it does not guarantee that the configuration will be optimal for `t` values adjusted by 0, 1, or 2.

2. The ranges for `i` in the two loops are limited to `mid - 1` to `1` and `mid + 1` to `100`. The algorithm does not consider `t` values that may be less than `mid - 1` or greater than `mid + 1`. For some distributions of stick lengths, the optimal `t` may require checking values much lower or higher than `mid`.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the input:
```
5
1 1 1 100 100
```
The expected optimal `t` is `1`, with a cost of `198` (since we need to change the three `1`s to `2` and the two `100`s to `2`). However, the implementation will fail to find this because it is limited by checking values around the median, which will not cover the edge cases effectively.

Therefore, since there are cases where the program does not work as expected, the output is **False**.
