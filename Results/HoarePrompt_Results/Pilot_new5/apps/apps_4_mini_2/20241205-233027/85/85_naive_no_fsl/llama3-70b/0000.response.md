Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

### Issues in the Code:
1. The condition used in the if statement: 
   ```python
   if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
   ```
   This condition is incorrect for determining whether the sum of the two shovels ends with a specific number of nines. The correct approach should instead check if the sum ends with '9', '99', '999', etc.

2. The calculation of pairs is not properly implemented. For larger values of `n`, the logic fails to count pairs based on their total cost ending with maximum nines. For example, if `n = 14`, it should correctly identify pairs like (1, 8) and (2, 7) which sum up to 9, as well as others that sum to 19, etc.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
For `n = 14`, the expected output is `9`, which includes pairs like (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,14), (6,13), (7,12), (8,11), (9,10). The code, however, will not calculate all these pairs correctly due to its flawed logic in the if condition.

Overall, since the program does not handle the requirement of finding pairs of shovels properly, it is deemed incorrect.
