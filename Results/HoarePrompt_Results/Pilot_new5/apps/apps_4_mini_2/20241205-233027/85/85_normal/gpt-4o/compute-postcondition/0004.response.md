The operation `n //= 10` performs an integer division of `n` by 10 and assigns the result back to `n`. Given that `n` must be 9, the value of `n` after the operation will be 0 (since 9 divided by 10 is 0 in integer division). The other variable, `max_9s`, remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is 1**
