The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial condition states that `n` is already an integer within the range of 2 to \(10^9\). After this line of code executes, `n` will be reassigned a new integer value based on the user input, which still must satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ \(10^9\). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 (new value based on input)**
