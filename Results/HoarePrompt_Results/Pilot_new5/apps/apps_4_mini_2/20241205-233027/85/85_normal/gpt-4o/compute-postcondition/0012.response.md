In the initial state, `n` is 0 and `max_9s` is equal to the number of trailing 9s in `n`. Since `n` is 0, it has no trailing 9s, making `max_9s` equal to 0.

Now, we calculate the value of `pairs`:
```
pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
```
Substituting the values:
- `n + 1` = 0 + 1 = 1
- `max_9s` = 0

Therefore,
```
pairs = 1 * 0 = 0
```

The output state will reflect these calculations. The values of `n` and `max_9s` remain unchanged, while `pairs` is now calculated as 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is 0, `pairs` is 0**
