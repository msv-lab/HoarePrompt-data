The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Since `i` was initialized to 1, `ans` now has a value that is one greater than its previous value. The precondition about `n` and `i` remains valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1.**
