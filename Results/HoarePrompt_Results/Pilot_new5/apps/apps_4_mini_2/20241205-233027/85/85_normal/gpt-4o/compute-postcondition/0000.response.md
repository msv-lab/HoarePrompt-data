The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that must be an integer within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `n` has been updated to the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `n` is now equal to the input integer.**
