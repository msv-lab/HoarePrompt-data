The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans`, which represents the count of times the sum `n` satisfies the condition. The value of `ans` is not modified by the print statement, and the previous state of `ans` remains unchanged. However, the result of the print operation affects the output state.

Output State: **`ans` is the count of times the sum `n` satisfies the condition; printed value is `ans`.**
