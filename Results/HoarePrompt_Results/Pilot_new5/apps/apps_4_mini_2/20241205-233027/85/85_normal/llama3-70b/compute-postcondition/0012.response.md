To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze the loop and its conditions.

The loop iterates `i` from `1` to `n // 2`, inclusive. The conditional inside the loop checks whether the sum `i + (n - i)` (which simplifies to `n`) fulfills a certain condition related to its last digit.

Given that `n` is constrained to be an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, we need to consider the full range of possible values for `n`.

1. The loop will execute `n // 2` times, where `i` will take values from `1` up to `n // 2`.
2. The variable `ans` counts how many times the condition inside the loop is satisfied.

### Output State Analysis
- If the loop does not execute (which occurs if `n` is less than `2` or if `n // 2` is `0`), `ans` remains `0`.
- If the loop executes all iterations, `ans` will reflect how many of those iterations satisfied the condition.

### Final Output State
Therefore, upon completion of the loop, the output state is defined as follows:

Output State: **`ans` is the count of times the sum `n` satisfies the condition, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
