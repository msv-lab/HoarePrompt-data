According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `(n + 1) % 10` must equal 0. Currently, `n` is 0. 

Calculating `(n + 1) % 10`:
1. If `n` is 0, then `(0 + 1) % 10` equals `1 % 10`, which is `1`. 
2. Since `1` is not equal to `0`, the loop cannot execute again.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` such that `(n + 1) % 10` equals `0`. This condition will be satisfied when `n + 1` is a multiple of `10`. 

The smallest multiple of `10` greater than `0` is `10`, so for `(n + 1)` to equal `10`, we need `n` to be `9`. 

Thus, we must adjust `n` to ensure it is equal to `9`.

No other states need to be adjusted based on the provided information.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 1**
