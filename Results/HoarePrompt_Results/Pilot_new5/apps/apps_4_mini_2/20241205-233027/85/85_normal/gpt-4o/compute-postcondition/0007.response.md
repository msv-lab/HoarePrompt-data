The value of `n` is modified by the operation `n //= 10`, which performs integer division of `n` by 10. Given that `n` must be 9, the calculation results in `n` being updated to 0 (since 9 divided by 10 is 0 when using integer division). The variable `max_9s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is 2**
