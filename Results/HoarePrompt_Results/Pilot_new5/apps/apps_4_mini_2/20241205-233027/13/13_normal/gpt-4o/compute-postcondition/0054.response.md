To evaluate the impact of the code snippet provided, we first analyze the current values of the variables involved in the computation.

1. `max_length` is the maximum length of segments of contiguous 'G's.
2. `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at `segments[i - 1]`.
3. `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at `segments[i - 1]`.
4. `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at `segments[i]`.
5. `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at `segments[i]`.
6. It is given that `curr_start - prev_end` equals `2`.

The code updates `max_length` with the maximum of its current value and a calculated new value based on the current and previous segment's start and end.

The formula for the new value is:
- The length of the current segment is computed as `curr_end - curr_start + 1`.
- The length of the previous segment is computed as `prev_end - prev_start + 1`.
- An additional `1` is added for the connection between segments.

Thus, the new value for `max_length` can be expressed as:
```
curr_end - curr_start + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 1 + 1
```

Since `curr_start - prev_end = 2`, we can substitute `prev_end` with `curr_start - 2`.

Now, we simplify:
1. `prev_end` = `curr_start - 2`
2. `prev_end - prev_start` = `(curr_start - 2) - prev_start`
3. Incorporating into the expression gives:
   ```
   max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + ((curr_start - 2) - prev_start) + 1 + 1)
   ```

The exact value of `max_length` after this operation depends on the specific initial values of `max_length`, `curr_end`, `curr_start`, and `prev_start`, which are not provided. However, we can conclude that `max_length` will now hold the maximum value computed between its previous value and the new value derived from the segments.

Thus, the output state will reflect the changes to `max_length` based on the computation:

Output State: **`max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the computed length from segments; `prev_start` is still the first element of `segments[i - 1]`, `prev_end` is still the second element of `segments[i - 1]`, `curr_start` is still the first element of `segments[i]`, `curr_end` is still the second element of `segments[i]`, and `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2.**
