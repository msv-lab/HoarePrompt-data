The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is 3, and `s` is a string of 'G's of length at least `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
