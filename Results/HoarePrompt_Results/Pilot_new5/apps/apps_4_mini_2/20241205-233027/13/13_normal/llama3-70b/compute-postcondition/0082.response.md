The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n - 2`, `j` is at least `i + 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
