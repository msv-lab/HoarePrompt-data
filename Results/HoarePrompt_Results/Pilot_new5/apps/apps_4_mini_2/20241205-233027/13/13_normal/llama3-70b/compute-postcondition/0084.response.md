According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 2` and continues as long as `j < n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 2`, which implies that `i + 2` is at most `n - 1`. This means that at the end of the last iteration, `j` must have been at least `i + 2` and is currently less than `n`. 

To determine the state for the next iteration:
1. `j` will be incremented by 1 at the beginning of the next iteration.
2. For the loop to execute again one more time, `j` must remain less than `n` after the increment.

Since `j` starts from `i + 2`, for the loop to execute another time, `j` must be incremented to `i + 3`, and this value must still be less than `n`. Thus, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n - 2`, `j` is at least `i + 3` and must be less than `n - 1`**.
