Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty obtainable with one swap, which is the maximum value of `beauty` calculated during the loop iterations. `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[n - 1]` have been evaluated against the conditions in the loop. If no valid pairs of 'G' followed by 'S' were found during the loop, then `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0.**
