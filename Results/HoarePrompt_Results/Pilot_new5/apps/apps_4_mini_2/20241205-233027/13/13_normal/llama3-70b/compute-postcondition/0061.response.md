The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1, changing it from its previous value of 1 to 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be at least 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 2, `j` is 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.
