The code assigns the values from `segments[i - 1]` to `prev_start` and `prev_end`. The value of `i` is 3, which means it accesses `segments[2]`. Therefore, `prev_start` and `prev_end` will be updated to the values stored in `segments[2]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the computed length from segments if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2; `prev_start` is set to `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is set to `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` is equal to `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` is equal to `segments[2][1]`, `i` is 3, and `len(segments)` must be greater than 3.**
