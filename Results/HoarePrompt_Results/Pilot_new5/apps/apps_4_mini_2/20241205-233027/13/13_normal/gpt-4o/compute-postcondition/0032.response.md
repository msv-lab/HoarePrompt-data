The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `start` is equal to `i`, which means after the increment, `start` will no longer be equal to `i`. Thus, the updated state of the variables will reflect this change in `i` while maintaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `trophies[i]` must be 'G', `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
