According to the code, the loop execution depends on the initial value of `j` and the range provided in the for loop statement. The loop will execute backwards from `i - 1` to `-1`. 

Given that `i` is currently 0, `j` will be initialized to `i - 1`, which is `-1`. Since the loop iterates until `j` is greater than or equal to `-1`, the loop will not execute as there are no valid indices to iterate over. 

To ensure the loop executes, `i` must be greater than 0, so `i` should be adjusted to at least 1. This way, `j` would start at 0 (1 - 1) and would execute the loop until it reaches -1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be at least 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 1, `j` is 0**
