The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the precondition states that `n` must be greater than `i`, after the increment, `i` will still be less than `n`. The state of `trophies[i]` remains 'G' as the execution does not modify this array. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `trophies[i]` must be 'G', and `i` is incremented by 1.**
