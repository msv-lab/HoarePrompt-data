The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected and remain the same. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is increased by 1 (now `left + 1`), `right` is greater than 0, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'.
