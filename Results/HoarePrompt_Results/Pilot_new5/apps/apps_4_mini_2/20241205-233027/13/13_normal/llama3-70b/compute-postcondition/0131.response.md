The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `i - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `beauty` is 1, and `s[j]` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
