To analyze the output state after all iterations of the while loop have completed, we consider the initial state and how the loop modifies the variables according to the logic provided.

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 0.

The while loop iterates through the `trophies` string by examining each character at index `i`. If the character is 'G', it captures the starting index and continues to increment `i` until a character that is not 'G' is found. It then appends the segment defined by the start index and the end index (the last 'G' index) to the `segments` list. If the character is 'S', it simply increments `i`.

After the loop has executed, the following conditions will hold:

- `i` will be equal to `n` once all characters in the `trophies` string have been processed.
- `segments` will contain all tuples of (start index, end index) for each contiguous segment of 'G' characters found in the `trophies` string.
- If there are no 'G' characters, `segments` will remain empty and `i` will end up at `n`.
- The original value of `n` remains unchanged, while `i` has traversed through all indices until reaching `n`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all segments of contiguous 'G's in `trophies`, and `n` remains unchanged. If there are no 'G's in `trophies`, `segments` is empty.**
