Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', and `j` is initialized to `i - 1` which will decrement until it reaches 0. If the character at `s[j]` is 'G', then `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, and `beauty` is now 2. Otherwise, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `beauty` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
