The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Since `left` starts at 1, its new value will be 2. The values of `n`, `s[left]`, and `right` remain unchanged as they are not affected. The condition that `s[left]` must not be 'G' is still valid, but since `left` has changed, it now refers to `s[2]` instead of `s[1]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `left` is 2, `s[left]` (which is `s[2]`) must not be 'G', and `right` must be greater than 1**.
