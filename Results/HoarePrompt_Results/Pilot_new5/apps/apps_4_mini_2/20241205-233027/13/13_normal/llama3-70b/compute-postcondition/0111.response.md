Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is initialized to -1 after the loop ends, `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]` (inclusive), and `s[j]` is not 'G'.***
