The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100000) and a string `trophies` of length `n` containing characters 'G' and 'S'. It identifies segments of contiguous 'G's in the string. It returns 0 if there are no 'G's present. If there is only one segment of 'G's, it returns the length of that segment. If there are multiple segments, it calculates the maximum length of contiguous 'G's, taking into account gaps of 2 characters between segments, and returns the minimum of this length plus 1 and `n`.
