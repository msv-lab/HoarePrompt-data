Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing segments of 'G's, `max_length` is the maximum length of segments of contiguous 'G's, `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at `segments[i - 1]`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at `segments[i - 1]`, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at `segments[i]`, `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at `segments[i]`. The current value of `curr_start` minus `prev_end` equals 2.***
