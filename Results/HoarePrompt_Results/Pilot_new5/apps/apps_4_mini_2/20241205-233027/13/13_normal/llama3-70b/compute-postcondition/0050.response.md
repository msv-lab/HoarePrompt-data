The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `curr_beauty` is initially 0, its new value becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, including `left`, `n`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `right`. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` or equal to `right` if 'G' does not occur before `right`; `s[left]` must be 'G' if `left` is less than `right`; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`; `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`, which is now 1; `right` has been incremented by 1; `curr_beauty` is now 1. The current value of `left` is less than `right`.

Output State: **`left` is equal to the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` or equal to `right` if 'G' does not occur before `right`; `s[left]` must be 'G' if `left` is less than `right`; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`; `max_beauty` is either 0 or 1; `right` has been incremented by 1; `curr_beauty` is now 1. The current value of `left` is less than `right.**
