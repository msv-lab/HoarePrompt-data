According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `i - 1` down to `0`, which means the starting value of `j` must be at least `0` for the loop to commence. Given the current state, `i` is at least `2`, so `i - 1` is at least `1`, which means `j` will start at a value of at least `1`. Thus, the loop will execute.

To summarize, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `j` will be initialized to `i - 1`, which is at least `1`.
- The loop will iterate until `j` reaches `0`.

No further adjustments are necessary since all provided conditions already satisfy the requirements for the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is initialized to `i - 1`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `beauty` is 1, and `j` will decrement until it reaches 0.**
