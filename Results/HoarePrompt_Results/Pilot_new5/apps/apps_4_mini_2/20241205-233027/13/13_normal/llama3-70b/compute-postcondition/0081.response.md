`beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n - 2`, `j` is at least `i + 3`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n - 2`, `j` is at least `i + 3`, `beauty` is increased by 1.**
