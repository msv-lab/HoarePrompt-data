Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', and `segments` is updated to include the tuple `(start, 2)` if `trophies[i]` is 'G', with `i` updated to 3. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', then `n` remains unchanged, `segments` is an empty list, and `i` is set to 1.***
