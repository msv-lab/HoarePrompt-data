The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 3, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `segments` includes the tuple `(start, 2)`, `i` is 4, `start` is 3, and `trophies[3]` must be 'G'.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `segments` includes the tuple `(start, 2)`, `i` is 4, `start` is 3, and `trophies[3]` must be 'G'**.
