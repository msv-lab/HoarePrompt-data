Postcondition: ***`max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the sum of the lengths defined by `curr_end - curr_start + 1` and `prev_end - prev_start + 1` plus 1, if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2. The variables `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end` are set according to the values in `segments`, with `i` equal to 3 and `len(segments)` being greater than 3.***
