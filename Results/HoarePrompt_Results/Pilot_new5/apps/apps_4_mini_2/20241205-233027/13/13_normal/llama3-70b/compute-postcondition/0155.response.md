Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and `n` must be greater than 3; `i` is less than `n - 2`; `j` is 3; `s` is a string of 'G's of length at least `i + 1`. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
