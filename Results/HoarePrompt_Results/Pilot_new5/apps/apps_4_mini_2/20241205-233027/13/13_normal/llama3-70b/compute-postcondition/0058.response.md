The variable `beauty` is assigned the value of 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `s` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', and `beauty` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', and `beauty` is 1**.
