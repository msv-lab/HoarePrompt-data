The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. After executing the function body, if certain conditions are met (which are not specified here), it will return specific outputs based on the content of the string `s`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', and returns results based on the evaluations of the string `s`.**
