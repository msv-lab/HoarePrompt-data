The code updates the value of `max_beauty` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr_beauty`. The previous state indicates that `max_beauty` was initially 0, and `curr_beauty` is based on the current loop state, which is not explicitly defined but will affect the value of `max_beauty`. 

Since `curr_beauty` could be any non-negative integer, the potential updates to `max_beauty` could range from 0 to the value of `curr_beauty`, thereby either keeping `max_beauty` at 0 or updating it to a greater value if `curr_beauty` is positive. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is either the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `right` is `n`, `left` remains 0 or the first index of 'G' in `s` (if applicable), and `curr_beauty` is based on the current state of the loop.**
