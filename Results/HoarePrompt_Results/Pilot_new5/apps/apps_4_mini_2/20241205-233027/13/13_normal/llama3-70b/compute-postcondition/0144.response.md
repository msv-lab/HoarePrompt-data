`beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` was `i + 1`, therefore, the new value of `beauty` is `i + 2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2,` `j` is -1, `s` is a string of 'G's of length at least `i + 1`, and the character at index `-1` of `s` (which is the last character of `s`) is 'G'; `beauty` is `i + 2`.**
