The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values from input, where `input` reads three positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] inclusive, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point. The previous states of the variables are not affected other than being assigned new values from the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are the three positive real numbers read from input, each in the range [0.1, 200.0] inclusive, with exactly one digit after the decimal point.**
