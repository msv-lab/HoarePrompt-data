The variable `a4` is assigned the value of `(x ** z) ** y`. By the properties of exponents, this can be simplified to `x ** (z * y)`. The initial states of `a1`, `a2`, and `a3` are unchanged, but we can express `a4` in terms of the existing variables. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers within the specified range, we can state that `a4` is equal to `x` raised to the power of the product of `z` and `y`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`; `a3` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y * z`; `a4` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z * y`.**
