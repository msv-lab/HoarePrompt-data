The variable `a6` is assigned the value of `y` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `x`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are in the range of 0.1 to 200.0. The states of the other variables `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`; `a3` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y * z`; `a4` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z * y`; `a5` is equal to `y`; `a6` is equal to `y ** z ** x`.**
