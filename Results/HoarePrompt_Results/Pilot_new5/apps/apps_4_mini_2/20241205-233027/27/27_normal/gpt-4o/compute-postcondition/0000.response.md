The code `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the `sys.stdin.read` function to the variable `input`. This means that `input` now references a function that can be used to read all the data from standard input at once. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them directly.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] inclusive, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `input` refers to the `sys.stdin.read` function.**
