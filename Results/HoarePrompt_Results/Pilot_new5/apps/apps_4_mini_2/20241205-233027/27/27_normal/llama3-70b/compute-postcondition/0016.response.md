The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers that must satisfy the condition 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, with each number having exactly one digit after the decimal point. However, the output behavior is not specified in the output section. Without additional information about the output, we cannot accurately describe the functionality of the function. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its output behavior is not specified.**
