The function accepts three integer parameters: `n` (an even integer between 2 and 10^9), `m` (an integer between 2 and 10^9), and `k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m). It calculates a modified value of `k` using `k % (n * 2 - 2)`, and based on the value of `k`, it outputs different pairs of integers. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it outputs `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, it outputs a pair calculated from `n` and `k`. If `k` is not less than `n * 2 - 2`, it outputs `(1, 2)`. The function does not handle cases where `k` could be greater than or equal to `n·m` after the modulo operation, which may not satisfy the input constraints.
