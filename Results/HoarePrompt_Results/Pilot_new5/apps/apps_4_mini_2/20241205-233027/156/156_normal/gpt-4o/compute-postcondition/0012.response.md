Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows` is equal to `(k - (n - 1)) // (m - 1)`; `remaining_steps` is equal to `(k - (n - 1)) % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` (which is an odd integer) and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.***
