The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an even integer; `m`, an integer; and `k`, a non-negative integer. The function computes and prints coordinates based on the value of `k` in relation to `n` and `m`.

1. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)`.
2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it adjusts `k` by subtracting `n - 1` and calculates:
   - `full_rows` as the integer division of the adjusted `k` by `(m - 1)`, determining how many complete rows have been passed.
   - `remaining_steps` as the modulus of the adjusted `k` by `(m - 1)`, which gives the steps remaining in the current row.

3. Depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, it calculates and prints the row and column as follows:
   - If `full_rows` is even, the row is calculated as `n - full_rows` and the column as `2 + remaining_steps`.
   - If `full_rows` is odd, the row is still `n - full_rows`, but the column is calculated as `m - remaining_steps`.

The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated coordinates. There are no explicit edge cases handled for values of `k` that might exceed `n * m`, but such a case is implicitly constrained by the input conditions stated. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n` (even), `m`, and a non-negative integer `k`, and prints calculated coordinates based on the value of `k` relative to `n` and `m`, without returning any values. **
