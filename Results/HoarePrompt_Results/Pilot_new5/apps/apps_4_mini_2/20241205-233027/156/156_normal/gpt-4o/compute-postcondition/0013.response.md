To provide the output state, we need to analyze the variables and their relationships based on the initial conditions and the code snippet given. 

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). 
   - `m` is an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\). 
   - `k` is equal to \(k - (n - 1)\), which means the new value of `k` becomes \(k = k - (n - 1)\).
   - `full_rows` is equal to \((k - (n - 1)) // (m - 1)\), so we substitute the new value of `k` to find `full_rows`:
     - \(full\_rows = \left( (k - (n - 1)) - (n - 1) \right) // (m - 1)\) simplifies to \(full\_rows = k // (m - 1)\).
   - `remaining_steps` is equal to \((k - (n - 1)) \% (m - 1)\), which is also updated with the new `k`:
     - \(remaining\_steps = \left( (k - (n - 1)) - (n - 1) \right) \% (m - 1)\) simplifies to \(remaining\_steps = k \% (m - 1)\).

2. **Determining `row` and `col`**:
   - If `full_rows` is even, then:
     - `row = n - full_rows`
     - `col = 2 + remaining_steps`
   - If `full_rows` is odd, then:
     - `row = n - full_rows` (which will be odd)
     - `col = m - remaining_steps`.

Since the output of the code snippet is `print(row, col)`, we will provide the output state directly based on the defined conditions.

3. **Output State**:
   - We need to keep all the valid preconditions while updating the final values of `row` and `col`. However, we do not have specific values for `k`, `n`, `m`, or how many full rows there are (even or odd). Thus, we retain the general relationships.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`; `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` (which is an odd integer) and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.**
