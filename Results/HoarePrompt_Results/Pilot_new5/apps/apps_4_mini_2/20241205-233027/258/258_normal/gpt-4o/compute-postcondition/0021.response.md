The line of code `meats.append((x, y, c))` adds a new tuple to the existing list `meats`. The tuple consists of the current values of `x`, `y`, and `c`. Since `x`, `y`, and `c` have been defined in the initial state as `int(data[9])`, `int(data[10])`, and `int(data[11])` respectively, the new tuple will reflect those integer values.

Thus, the impact of the code on the program is that the list `meats` will now include an additional tuple with the values of `x`, `y`, and `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(int(data[9]), int(data[10]), int(data[11]))`, `index` is 9, `x` is equal to `int(data[9])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[10])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[11])`.**
