The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. The initial state mentions that `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. Therefore, `ans` will either remain the same if it is less than or equal to `times[K - 1]`, or it will be updated to `times[K - 1]` if that value is smaller. The specific value of `times[K - 1]` is not provided, so we can't determine the exact new value of `ans`, but we know that it is updated based on the comparison.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted.**
