To evaluate the provided code snippet, we first note the initial state:

Initial State: `x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted output of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`

The line of code `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` assigns to `ans` the minimum value between its current value and the value at the index `K - 1` in the list `times`. However, we do not know the values of `ans` and `K` from the initial state, so we cannot definitively update `ans`. We also cannot derive the exact value of `times[K - 1]` without knowing the output of `func_2` and the value of `K`.

Since `ans` and `K` are not defined in the initial state, they remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects that `times` remains unchanged, while `ans` has not been defined or affected in a measurable way.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted output of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998), and `ans` is unchanged while `K` is undefined.**
