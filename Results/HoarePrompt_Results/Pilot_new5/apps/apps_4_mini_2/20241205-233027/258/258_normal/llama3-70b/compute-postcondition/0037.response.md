To determine the output state after the execution of the code snippet, we analyze the variables and their relationships:

- `x` is -998
- `y` is -999
- `times` is a sorted list resulting from `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. However, the exact contents of `times` and the value of `K` are not provided in the initial state.

The line of code `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` suggests that `ans` is being updated. The value of `ans` will be the minimum of its current value and the value at the index `K - 1` of the `times` list.

Since we donâ€™t have the initial value of `ans` or the specific contents of `times`, we can't compute a definitive output. However, we can note the impact of the code on the program.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `times` is a sorted list resulting from `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.**
