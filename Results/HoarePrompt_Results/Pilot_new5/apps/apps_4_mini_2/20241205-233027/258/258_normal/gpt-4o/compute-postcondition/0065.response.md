The variable `my` is assigned the value of `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The variables `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d` have specific values based on the initial state. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`, `mx` is assigned the value `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
