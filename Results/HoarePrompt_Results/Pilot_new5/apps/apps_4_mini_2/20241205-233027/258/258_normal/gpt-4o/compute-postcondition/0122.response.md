Given the initial state: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, and `N` is greater than `i + 2`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are updated to the values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` respectively, while `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` take on the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.

The code snippet provided:
```
d = c1 * T - c2 * T
```

Now, let's evaluate the impact of the code on the program:

1. The expression `d = c1 * T - c2 * T` computes the difference between `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`. Since `c1` and `c2` are not changed by this operation, their values remain the same unless the condition specified before this snippet is met.
2. The code snippet does not change the values of `c1`, `c2`, `x1`, `y1`, or `x2`, `y2` directly. Instead, it only calculates a new value for `d`.

Therefore, the output state will retain all the information of the precondition while noting the calculation that was performed.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2, d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`.**
