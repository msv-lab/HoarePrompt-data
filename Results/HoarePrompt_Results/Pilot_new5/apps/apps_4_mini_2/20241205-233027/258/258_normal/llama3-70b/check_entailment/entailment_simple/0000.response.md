The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimal time required to grill K or more pieces of meat given their coordinates and hardness values. Let's analyze the program step by step against the requirements laid out in the problem description.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:** 
   - The program reads the number of meat pieces `N` and the number of pieces `K` that Takahashi wants to eat.
   - It then reads the coordinates and hardness values for each piece of meat and stores them in a list called `meats`.

2. **Distance Calculation (Func_1):**
   - The function `func_1(x, y, X, Y)` calculates the Euclidean distance between the heat source `(X, Y)` and a piece of meat `(x, y)`. This is correctly implemented using the formula:
     \[
     \sqrt{(X - x)^2 + (Y - y)^2}
     \]

3. **Time Calculation (Func_2):**
   - The function `func_2(x, y, X, Y)` computes the time taken for each piece of meat to be ready by multiplying its hardness `c` by the distance calculated through `func_1`. This function returns a list of times for all meat pieces when the heat source is at coordinates `(X, Y)`.
   - The list comprehension is correctly implemented to return the proper times.

4. **Minimizing Time (Func_3):**
   - The function `func_3` iterates over all possible integer coordinates `(x, y)` from `-1000` to `1000`, calling `func_2` for each coordinate pair.
   - It sorts the list of times and takes the `K-1` smallest time (the time for the K-th piece of meat) to update `ans`, which keeps track of the minimum time found.
   - Finally, the function returns the minimum time across all positions of the heat source.

### Correctness Evaluation

- The program correctly computes the grilling times for each piece of meat based on the heat source's position and hardness values.
- It sorts the calculated times and correctly identifies the minimal time required for at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready.
- The final returned value from `func_3` meets the output requirements.

### Floating Point Precision
- The problem description states that the output will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error from the correct answer is at most \(10^{-6}\). The program doesn't explicitly handle floating-point precision but relies on Python's inherent handling of floats, which is generally sufficient for this problem.

### Conclusion

The program performs the required computations as specified in the problem description. It calculates distances, computes grilling times, sorts these times, and finds the minimum for at least `K` pieces of meat. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements:

Correctness: **True**
