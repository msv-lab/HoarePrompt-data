According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000. The variable `x` is currently at -999. Since the loop continues as long as `x` is less than 1000, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is -999, so for the next iteration, `x` will be -998. The loop will execute again until `x` reaches a value of 1000, and since `x` is now set to -998, it falls within the range of the loop.

The other variables remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop's iteration.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is 1000, `times` is a sorted version of the non-empty list returned by `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`**.
