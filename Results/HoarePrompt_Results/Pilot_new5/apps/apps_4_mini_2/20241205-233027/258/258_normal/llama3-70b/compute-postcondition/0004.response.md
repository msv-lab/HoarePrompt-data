The variable `times` is assigned the result of the function call `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`. The `sort()` method is called on `times`, which will rearrange the elements of the `times` list in ascending order. Since the original values of `times` are unknown (dependent on the output of `func_2`), we cannot specify its exact content after sorting. However, we know that `times` will now contain sorted elements based on the initial state given.

The other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `ans`) remain unchanged after executing this code.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is float('inf'), `times` is sorted from the result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**.
