Postcondition: ***`mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; and `count` is equal to the sum of `c` for which the condition `math.sqrt((mx - x) ...`. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True.***
