The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. This means that the execution will continue with the next loop iteration, but the values of the variables in the current iteration will not change. 

In this case, the values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `count`, `j`, and `d` will remain the same. However, the loop will skip to the next iteration without executing any code that follows the `continue` statement within the same loop.

Since the current values of the variables are still valid after the execution, and no variables have changed, the Output State is:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
