The expression for `mx` is assigned the value of `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The calculation involves `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)`, which is influenced by the values of `d` and `d2`. The precondition states that if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, the loop continues without changes to the variables, indicating that this code likely executes within a loop where the condition is true.

Since `d` and `d2` are real numbers, the computation for `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)` will yield a value based on these variables. The overall value of `mx` will depend on the specific values of `cx`, `dy`, `d`, and `d2`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the calculation of `mx`.

Output State: **`d` and `d2` are real numbers; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
