The variable `ans` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, or `K`. The constraints on `x`, `y`, and `K` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers within the range [-1000, 1000]; `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `ans` is float('inf').**
