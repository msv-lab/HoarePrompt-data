The code assigns the value `2` to the variable `index`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is the integer value obtained from `data[0]`, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is an empty list, and `index` is 2. 

Output State: **`N` is the integer value obtained from `data[0]`, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2.**
