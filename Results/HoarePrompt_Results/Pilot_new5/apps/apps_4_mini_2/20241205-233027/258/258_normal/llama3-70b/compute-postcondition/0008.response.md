To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code, we analyze the impact of the code on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`
- `times` is the result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`

The line of code provided is:
```
times.sort()
```

1. The `sort()` method will sort the list `times` in-place. This means that the order of the elements in `times` will change, but the actual elements remain the same.
2. The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, and `ans` are not affected by the sorting of the list `times`.

Since `times` has been sorted, we conclude that its new order is not specified, but it has been altered from its previous order. The minimum value of `ans` may also change depending on the new sorted order of `times`, but we have no specific information about the elements of `times` or its effect on `ans`.

Output State: 
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`
- `times` is sorted

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted.**
