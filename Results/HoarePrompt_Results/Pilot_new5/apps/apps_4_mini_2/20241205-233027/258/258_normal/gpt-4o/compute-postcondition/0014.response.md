The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`. The value of `index` is 5, which means `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains the tuple `(data[5], int(data[6]), c)`, `index` is 5, `x` is now equal to `data[5]`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`.**
