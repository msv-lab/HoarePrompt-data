The variable `y` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. Since `index` is equal to 9, this means `y` will take the value of `int(data[10])`. The previous value of `y` (which was equal to `int(data[6])`) will be overwritten. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(data[5], int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `index` is 9, `x` is equal to `int(data[9])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[10])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[7])**
