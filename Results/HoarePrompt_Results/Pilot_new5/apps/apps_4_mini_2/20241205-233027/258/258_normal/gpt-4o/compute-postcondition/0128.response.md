The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The values of `x1` and `x2` are not specified in the initial state but they are used in the calculation. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.**
