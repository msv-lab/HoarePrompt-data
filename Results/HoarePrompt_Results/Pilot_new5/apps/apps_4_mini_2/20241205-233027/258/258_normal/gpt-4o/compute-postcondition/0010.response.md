The code increments the value of `index` by 3. The previous value of `index` was 2, so after the execution, `index` becomes 5. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` now contains a tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 5, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]**.
