The code `continue` does not change any variable values but indicates that the current iteration of a loop is ending and the next iteration will begin. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as before the `continue` statement. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and the current value of `d` is less than 0.**
