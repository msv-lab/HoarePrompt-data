The function accepts four parameters, x, y, X, and Y, which are real numbers representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y) using the distance formula. There are no explicit edge cases handled in the code, but the distance calculation will return a valid result for any real number input, including negative values and zero.
