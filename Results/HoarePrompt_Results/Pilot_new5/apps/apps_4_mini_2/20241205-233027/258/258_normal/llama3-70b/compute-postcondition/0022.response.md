The `times` variable is sorted in ascending order. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as the sorting operation does not affect them. The value of `times` is updated to reflect its sorted order, but since the specific contents of `times` are not provided, we can only express it as sorted. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the sorting effect on `times`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
