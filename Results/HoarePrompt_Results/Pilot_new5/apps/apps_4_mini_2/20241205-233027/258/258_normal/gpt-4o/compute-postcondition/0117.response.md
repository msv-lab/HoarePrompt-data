According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `N`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1` and continues until `j` is less than `N`. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, since `N` is greater than `i + 3`, the value of `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

If `j` was `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will now be `i + 2`. Thus, `N` still needs to be greater than `i + 2` in order for the loop to continue.

State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is equal to the count of tuples in `meats` satisfying the condition, `j` is `i + 2`**
