To evaluate the impact of the code snippet on the initial state, we note the following:

- The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. 
- The precise values of `ans` and `times[K - 1]` are not given in the initial state, so we must retain the expression.
- The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x` and `y`, and the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
