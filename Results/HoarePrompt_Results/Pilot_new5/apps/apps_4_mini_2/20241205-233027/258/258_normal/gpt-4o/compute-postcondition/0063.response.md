Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, and `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition. If `d * d2 > d2`, then `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, now updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`, and we continue to the next iteration. If the condition is not met, no changes are made and the program proceeds without any updates.***
