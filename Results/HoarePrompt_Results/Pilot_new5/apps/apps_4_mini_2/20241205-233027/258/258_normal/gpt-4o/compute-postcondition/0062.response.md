The `continue` statement does not modify any variables or values; it simply causes the loop or iteration control structure to skip the remaining code and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their values from the initial state.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`, and we continue to the next iteration.**
