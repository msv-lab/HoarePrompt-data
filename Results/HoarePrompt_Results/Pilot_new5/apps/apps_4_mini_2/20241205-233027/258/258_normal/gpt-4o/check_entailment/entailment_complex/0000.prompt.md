You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

            if count >= K:
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is the total number of tuples in `meats`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition across all iterations, and the loop finishes after evaluating all valid pairs; if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the return value is `True`, otherwise the return value is `False`.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the count of tuples in 'meats' that meet the specified distance condition is less than K.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, a positive integer `K`, and a non-negative real number `T`. It returns `True` if there are at least `K` pieces of meat within a certain distance defined by the computed conditions involving their coordinates and hardness; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function checks pairs of meats, performing calculations based on their distances and hardness to determine the count of meats that meet the distance condition. Importantly, if no pairs meet the criteria such that the count is at least `K`, the function will return `False`. Edge cases may include scenarios where `K` is greater than the length of `meats`, which would directly result in `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat Takahashi wants to eat such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i), `low` is approximately equal to `high`, with a difference of less than or equal to 1e-07, and `mid` is also approximately equal to both `low` and `high`. The final values of `low` and `high` will be such that `func_1(meats, K, mid)` determined the adjustments in `low` and `high` during the iterations. If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` was true in the last iteration, then `high` is the last value of `mid`; if false, `low` is the last value of `mid`.
    return high
    #The program returns high, which is the last value of mid after iterating through the adjustments based on func_1(meats, K, mid).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of tuples `meats`, and performs a binary search to determine the maximum hardness value that allows Takahashi to eat exactly `K` pieces of meat from the given list. It returns the last computed value of `high` after the iterations, which represents this maximum hardness threshold. The function relies on an external function `func_1` to check the feasibility of eating `K` pieces at the current hardness level.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), K is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be ready (1 <= K <= N), and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100.

    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is the original integer value obtained from `data[0]`, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains `N` tuples of the form `(data[2], data[3], data[4]), ..., (data[2 + 3 * (N - 1)], data[2 + 3 * (N - 1) + 1], data[2 + 3 * (N - 1) + 2])`, `index` is `2 + 3 * N`.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `N` (the number of pieces of meat) and `K` (the number of pieces to be ready), along with a list of tuples `meats` where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. It processes this input and then calls another function `func_2` with these parameters, returning a float formatted to six decimal places. However, the function does not handle any invalid input cases or exceptions that may arise from incorrect data types or values outside the specified ranges.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
