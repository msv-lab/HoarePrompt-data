Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y2)) / 2`, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `count` is less than `K`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are updated to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`, respectively, while `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are updated to the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`, respectively.***
