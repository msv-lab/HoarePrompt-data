Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is at least `K`, `j` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned the values from `meats[i]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned the values from `meats[j]`. The current value of `c1` multiplied by `T` is less than the current value of `c2` multiplied by `T`.***
