The value of `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The variables `y1` and `y2` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine specific values for `cy`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is at least `K`, `j` is `i + 1`, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2), `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
