The variable `my` is assigned the value of `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. 

We know from the initial state that:
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)`
- `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`

Thus, the value of `my` can be expressed as:
```
my = (y1 + y2) / 2 - ((x1 - x2) / 2) * math.sqrt(((x1 - x2) * T) / (c1 * c2) - (((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)) * ((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)) / (x1 - x2)
```

Given that `N` is greater than `i + 2`, it does not affect the calculation of `my`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)`, `mx` is equal to `cx + (dy * sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)) / d2`, and `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
