Output State: **`mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `count` is equal to the sum of `c` for which the condition `math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T` holds true for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats`.**
