The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c1 * T - c2 * T`, which simplifies to `(c1 - c2) * T`. The values of `meats`, `K`, and `count` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`.**
