To derive the output state, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State: 
- `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`
- `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4`
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`

The code:
```
mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

Now, let's analyze this statement step by step:

1. The variable `mx` is assigned a new value based on the current values of `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`.
2. The expression `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)` is computed.
3. The final value of `mx` is calculated as `cx + (dy * (result_of_sqrt) / d2)`.

The initial variables `d`, `d2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged, but `mx` gets a new value based on the calculations.

Since we don't have specific values for `c1`, `c2`, `T`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, or `y2`, we can't calculate explicit values for `mx`. However, we can express it in terms of existing variables.

Overall, the output state captures the values that have changed or been calculated:

Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
