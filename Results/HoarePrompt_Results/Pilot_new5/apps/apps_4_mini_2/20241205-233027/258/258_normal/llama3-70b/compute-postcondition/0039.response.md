The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` assigns the result of the function `func_2` when called with the parameters `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are both -998. The state of `times` will change based on the output of `func_2` for these specific input values.

The output state will now include the updated value of `times`, which is the result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged in this context, as it is not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is the output of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]` (which is not specified here).

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is the output of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**.
