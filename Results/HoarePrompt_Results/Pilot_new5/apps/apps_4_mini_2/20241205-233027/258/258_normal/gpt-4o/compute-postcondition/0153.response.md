The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`, which calculates the difference between `x1` and `x2`, then divides that difference by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
