Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, and `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then the tuples at indices `i` and `j` in `meats` are swapped, resulting in `x1, y1, c1` being equal to the initial values of `x2, y2, c2`, and `x2, y2, c2` being equal to the initial values of `x1, y1, c1`.***
