Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`. If `d` is less than 0, the function will handle the case where the current value of `d` is negative accordingly.***
