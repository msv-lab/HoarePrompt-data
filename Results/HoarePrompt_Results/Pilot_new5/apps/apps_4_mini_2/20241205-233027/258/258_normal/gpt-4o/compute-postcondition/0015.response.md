The code `meats.append((x, y, c))` adds a new tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. The variables `x`, `y`, and `c` have specific values derived from the initial state. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `meats` will contain an additional tuple.

Here are the specific values according to the initial state:
- `x` is equal to `data[5]`
- `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`
- `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`

Thus, the new tuple `(data[5], int(data[6]), int(data[7]))` will be added to the `meats` list.

Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will represent the updated state of `meats` including the new tuple while retaining the initial information for all other variables.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(data[5], int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `index` is 5, `x` is equal to `data[5]`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`.**
