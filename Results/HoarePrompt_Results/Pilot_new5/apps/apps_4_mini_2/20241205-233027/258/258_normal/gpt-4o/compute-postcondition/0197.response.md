`dx` is assigned the value of (x1 - x2) / 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `d2` is a real number, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.

Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `d2` is a real number, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`**.
