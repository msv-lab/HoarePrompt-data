The value of `K` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, which means `K` is now defined as a specific integer. The values of `N`, `meats`, and `data` remain unchanged. The condition for `K` still holds true, i.e., `1 <= K <= N`.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value obtained from `data[0]`, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i), and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
