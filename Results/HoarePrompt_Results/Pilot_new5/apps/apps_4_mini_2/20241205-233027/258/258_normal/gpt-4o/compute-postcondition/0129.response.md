The code `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2` assigns the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2` to `dy`. The values of `y1` and `y2` are not specified, but `dy` is now defined in terms of these variables. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2.**
