Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition, and the loop will continue until either `count` is greater than or equal to `K` or all valid pairs have been evaluated. If the loop finishes without returning True, then `count` is less than `K`.**
