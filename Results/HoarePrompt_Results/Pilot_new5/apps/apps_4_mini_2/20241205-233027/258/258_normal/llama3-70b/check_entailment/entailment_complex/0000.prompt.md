You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
Annotated Functions:
import math

(N, K) = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    (x, y, c) = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
print(func_3())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, X, and Y are real numbers representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y) in the two-dimensional plane, calculated using the formula math.sqrt((X - x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters, x, y, X, and Y, which are real numbers representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y) using the distance formula. There are no explicit edge cases handled in the code, but the distance calculation will return a valid result for any real number input, including negative values and zero.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the coordinates of the pieces of meat, X and Y are real numbers representing the position of the heat source, and c is an integer representing the hardness of the meat, with the constraint that 1 <= c <= 100.
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list containing the product of the hardness of each piece of meat (c) and the result of func_1(x, y, X, Y) for each meat represented by coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integer coordinates (x, y) representing pieces of meat, real numbers (X, Y) indicating the position of a heat source, and returns a list where each element is the product of the hardness of the corresponding meat (c) and the output of another function `func_1(x, y, X, Y)`. The code assumes that the variable `meats`, which is not defined in the function, contains a list of tuples where each tuple includes the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of each meat piece. If `meats` is not properly defined, a NameError will occur.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers within the range [-1000, 1000], and K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, where N is the total number of meat pieces.
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` across all pairs of (x, y) generated by the loops, and `times` is a sorted list generated from the results of `func_2` for each pair of (x, y).
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value of times[K - 1] across all pairs of (x, y) generated by the loops, where x is 1000, y is 1000, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and times is a sorted list generated from the results of func_2 for each pair of (x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all pairs of integers (x, y) generated from the ranges [-1000, 1000]. The variable `K` is assumed to be a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, where N is the number of elements in the list `times`. The list `times` is generated by calling `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each pair of (x, y) and is sorted before determining the minimum value. There are no checks for the validity of `K` or the return value of `func_2`, which could lead to potential out-of-bounds errors if `K` is greater than the length of `times`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
