According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `N`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1`, and for each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 until it reaches `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `N`. Therefore, in the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 2`. 

To ensure the loop can run one more time, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`. 

State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` satisfying the specified condition, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2**
