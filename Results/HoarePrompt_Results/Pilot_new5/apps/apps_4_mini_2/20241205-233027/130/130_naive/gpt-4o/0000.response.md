To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and check if all cases are handled correctly.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- Ivan has `K` coins and there are `N` different collectible coins.
- Ivan has `M` friends, and they must gift him coins such that:
  1. Each friend gifts the same number of coins.
  2. All coins gifted must be different.
  3. At least `L` of the gifted coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

**Program Logic Analysis:**
1. The program reads four integers: `N`, `M`, `K`, `L`.
2. It calculates `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend must gift using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`. This ensures that at least `L` coins are new.
3. It checks if the total coins gifted `M * min_x` is less than or equal to the number of different coins available (`N - K`), meaning that the new coins must not exceed the total different coins available after accounting for what Ivan already has.
4. If the condition is satisfied, it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `M` (number of friends) is greater than `N` (total number of different coins), it's impossible to gift different coins since there won't be enough unique coins for each friend.
- If `L` (the required new coins) plus the existing coins `K` is greater than `N`, it's impossible for all friends to gift distinct new coins.

**Example Cases Analysis:**
1. **Case 1: `20 15 2 3`**
   - Here, `L = 3`, `M = 15`, `K = 2`, and `N = 20`.
   - Minimum coins per friend: `(3 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`.
   - Total coins to be gifted: `15 * 1 = 15`.
   - Available new coins: `20 - 2 = 18` (sufficient).
   - The output will be `1`, which is correct.

2. **Case 2: `10 11 2 4`**
   - Here, `L = 4`, `M = 11`, `K = 2`, and `N = 10`.
   - Minimum coins per friend: `(4 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 1`.
   - Total coins to be gifted: `11 * 1 = 11`.
   - Available new coins: `10 - 2 = 8` (not sufficient).
   - The output will be `-1`, which is correct.

**Finding a Failing Test Case:**
- Let's consider an edge case where `N = K + L` and `M > 1`.
  - For example, `N = 5`, `M = 3`, `K = 2`, `L = 3`.
  - Here, `min_x = (3 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 1`.
  - Total coins required: `3 * 1 = 3`, available new coins: `5 - 2 = 3` (sufficient).
  - It will output `1`, which is correct.
  
- Now, let's take another case to check the boundaries:
  - `N = 10`, `M = 10`, `K = 5`, `L = 6`.
  - Here, `min_x = (6 + 10 - 1) // 10 = 1`.
  - Total coins needed: `10 * 1 = 10`, available new coins: `10 - 5 = 5` (not sufficient).
  - Should output `-1`, which is correct.

After several tests, it appears the program correctly covers the requirements of the problem description. 

**Final Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if the number of coins each friend can gift meets the conditions laid out in the problem description, and handles possible edge cases appropriately.
