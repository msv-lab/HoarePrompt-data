The function `func` accepts four parameters: `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. All parameters are integers, with the constraints that 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= M, L <= 10^18. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot describe the return value without further details. 

Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters N, M, K, and L, with specific constraints on their values. The return value is not specified.**
