To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the annotated program.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **N**: Total different collectible coins.
2. **M**: Number of Ivan's friends.
3. **K**: Number of coins already in Ivan's collection.
4. **L**: Minimum number of new coins that must be in Ivan's collection after receiving gifts.

The friends must:
- Gift the same number of coins.
- Gift only different coins.
- Ensure that at least **L** of the gifted coins are new to Ivan's collection.

### Analyzing the Program Logic:
1. It reads the inputs **N**, **M**, **K**, **L**.
2. It computes `min_x`, the minimum number of coins each friend must gift, as:
   ```python
   min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
   ```
   This formula correctly computes the smallest integer greater than or equal to `L / M`, ensuring that the total number of new coins from all friends is at least **L**.

3. The condition checks whether the total number of coins given (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the number of different coins available after accounting for what Ivan already has (`N - K`):
   ```python
   if (M * min_x <= N - K):
   ```

4. If the condition is satisfied, it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1` indicating that it is not possible to meet the given requirements.

### Validation against Problem Requirements:
- **Gifting Same Amount**: The calculation of `min_x` ensures each friend gives the same number of coins.
- **Different Coins Guaranteed**: The check `M * min_x <= N - K` ensures that there are enough different coins available after considering the coins Ivan already possesses.
- **Minimum New Coins**: The formula for `min_x` ensures that at least `L` new coins will be included in the gifts.

### Edge Cases:
1. When **M > N**: The program correctly returns `-1` because it's impossible to gift more coins than the available different coins.
2. When **K + L > N**: If Ivan's current coins plus the minimum new coins needed exceed the total number of different coins, the program will also return `-1`.
3. Other combinations where the logic holds true based on the provided calculations.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem specification and properly accounts for all conditions outlined. Therefore, it handles all specified constraints and edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
