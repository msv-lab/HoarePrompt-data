#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is an integer representing the number of subtasks per task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is a non-negative integer representing the total available minutes (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and t is a list of k integers where each integer t[j] represents the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to the maximum number of tasks that could be completed within `M`, `time_used` is the total time used for completed tasks, `points` is the total points based on the number of completed tasks, `remaining_time` is the leftover time after completing the tasks, `subtasks_solved` is the maximum subtasks that could be solved with the remaining time, `max_points` is the maximum points achievable given the constraints.
    return max_points
    #The program returns the maximum points achievable given the constraints, which is represented by the variable 'max_points'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n`, `k`, and `M` and a list `t`, calculates the maximum points achievable by completing full tasks and utilizing leftover time for solving subtasks, and returns that maximum points. It does not handle cases where `M` is zero, which would imply no possible completion of tasks or subtasks.
