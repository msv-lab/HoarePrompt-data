The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. This indicates that `dp[i][j]` is updated to the value of the previous column in the same row, specifically for the current `i` and `j`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `dp[i][j]` now holds the value from `dp[i][j - 1]`, the output state reflects that `dp[i][j]` is now equal to whatever `dp[i][j - 1]` was, while the conditions concerning `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` still hold.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` must be greater than `M`, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
