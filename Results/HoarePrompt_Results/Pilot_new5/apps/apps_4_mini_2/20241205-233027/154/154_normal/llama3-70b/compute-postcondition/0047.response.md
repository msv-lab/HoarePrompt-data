Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `dp[1][3]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[1][3]` and `dp[0][3 - t[0]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.***
