Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, and `t` has at least one more element. If there is sufficient `remaining_time` to complete the subtasks, then `remaining_time` is decreased by the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.***
