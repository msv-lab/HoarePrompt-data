To understand the impact of the code on the program, we analyze the variables involved:

1. `max_points` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`.
2. The values of `points` and `subtasks_solved` remain unchanged.
3. The value of `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k` but it does not affect the calculation directly here since it is part of the expression used for `max()`. 

Since we do not know the initial value of `max_points`, we denote it as `max_points_current`.

Thus, after executing the code:

- `max_points` will now hold the value `max(max_points_current, points + subtasks_solved)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and (n - complete_tasks) * k, `max_points` is max(max_points_current, points + subtasks_solved)**.
