The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: 
- `n`: an integer representing the number of tasks (with constraints of 1 ≤ n ≤ 45).
- `k`: an integer representing the number of subtasks per task (with constraints of 1 ≤ k ≤ 45).
- `M`: a non-negative integer representing the total available minutes (with constraints of 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).
- `t`: a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` represents the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask (with constraints of 1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000).

After executing the function body, the program returns the maximum points achievable given the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of tasks, subtasks, available minutes, and a list of time requirements for the subtasks, returning the maximum points achievable under these constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and t, and returns the maximum points achievable given the constraints.**
