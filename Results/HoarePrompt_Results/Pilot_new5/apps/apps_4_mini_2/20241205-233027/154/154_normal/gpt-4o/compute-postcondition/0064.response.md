`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the value of `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Given that `remaining_time` is equal to `M - (n * total_time_per_task)` and `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, the output state will reflect the updated value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The other variables' states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - (n * total_time_per_task)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `t` is a non-empty collection, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
