The variable `subtasks_solved` is updated by adding the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The variable `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, where `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used` and `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`. Therefore, the value of `subtasks_solved` increases by this maximum number of subtasks that can be solved given the remaining time and the time each subtask takes.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is M - time_used, `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `max_points` is max(max_points_current, points + subtasks_solved), `t` contains at least 1 element, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
