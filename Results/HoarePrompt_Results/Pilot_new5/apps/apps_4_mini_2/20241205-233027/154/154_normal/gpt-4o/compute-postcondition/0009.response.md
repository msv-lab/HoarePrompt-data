The variable `subtasks_solved` is initialized to 0. The other variables `n`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, `points`, and `remaining_time` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0.**
