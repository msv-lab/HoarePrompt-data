Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `dp` has updated its first row such that `dp[1][j] = dp[1][j - 1]` for each `j`, `i` is 1, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]` (the element at index 0 of list `t`).***
