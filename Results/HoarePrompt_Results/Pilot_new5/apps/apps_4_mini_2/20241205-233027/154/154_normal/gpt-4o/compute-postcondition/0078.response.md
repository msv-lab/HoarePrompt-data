Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to the total number of subtasks solved across the tasks based on the `remaining_time` and the subtasks' times in `t`. `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`. If the loop does not execute, then `remaining_time` remains as initially calculated (M - (n * total_time_per_task)), and `subtasks_solved` remains 0.`**
