Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `subtask_time` is the next element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`.**
