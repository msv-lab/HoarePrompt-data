The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of tasks, an integer `k` representing the number of subtasks per task, a non-negative integer `M` representing the total available minutes, and a list `t` of integers where each integer represents the time required to solve a subtask. The function calculates the maximum points achievable based on completing full tasks and solving additional subtasks within the available time `M`.

The function iterates through all possible numbers of complete tasks that can be finished within the time limit. For each complete task, it calculates the time used and remaining time. Then it determines how many subtasks can be solved with the remaining time while ensuring the total number of subtasks does not exceed what is available after the complete tasks.

The functionality does not seem to account for cases where `M` is zero, which would lead to zero points since no tasks or subtasks can be completed. The function also assumes that the subtasks can be solved in any order without specific constraints on selection.

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n`, `k`, and `M` and a list `t`, calculates the maximum points achievable by completing full tasks and utilizing leftover time for solving subtasks, and returns that maximum points. It does not handle cases where `M` is zero, which would imply no possible completion of tasks or subtasks. **
