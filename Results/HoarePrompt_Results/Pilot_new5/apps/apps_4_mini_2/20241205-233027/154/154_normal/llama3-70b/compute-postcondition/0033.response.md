Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `M`, and `dp[k + 1][j]` contains the maximum number of items that can be selected based on the values in `dp[k][j]` and `dp[k][j - t[k - 1]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[k - 1]`.**
