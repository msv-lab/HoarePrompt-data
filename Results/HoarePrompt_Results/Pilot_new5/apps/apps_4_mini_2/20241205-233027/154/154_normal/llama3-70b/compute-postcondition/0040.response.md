According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `M`. The loop iterates `j` from `1` to `M`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `1`, and since the loop is defined to continue while `j <= M`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be incremented by `1`. Therefore, `j` will become `2`.

The conditions on `M` indicate that it is at least `1`, and since `j` is to be less than or equal to `M`, `M` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute again. 

Hence, the updated state reflects that `j` is now `2`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 2, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][1]` is equal to `dp[1][0]`.**
