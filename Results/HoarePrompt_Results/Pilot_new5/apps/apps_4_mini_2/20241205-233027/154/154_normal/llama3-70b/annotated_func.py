#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is an integer representing the number of subtasks per task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is a non-negative integer representing the total minutes available (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and t is a list of integers of length k where each element t[j] (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000) represents the time required to solve the j-th subtask of any task.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, and `dp[k][j]` contains the maximum number of items that can be selected with the first `k` items and capacity `j` for all `j` from 1 to `M`. If `M` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` remains 0 for all `i` and `j`.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (number of tasks), an integer `k` (number of subtasks per task), and a non-negative integer `M` (total minutes available), along with a list `t` of length `k` representing the time required for each subtask. It computes the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the available minutes `M`, considering the time constraints for each subtask, and returns the total count of completed subtasks along with a count of how many of the original subtasks can be completed completely within `M`.
