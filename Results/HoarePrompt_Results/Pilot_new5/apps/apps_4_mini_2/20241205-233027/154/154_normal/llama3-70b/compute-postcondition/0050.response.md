The code calculates the sum of two components: the total maximum number of items that can be selected with the first `k` items and capacity `M`, represented by `sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))`, and the count of how many times the total maximum number of items equals the number of items considered, represented by `sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)`.

Given the initial state, the specific values of `dp` for each `i` and `M` determine the output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, the output is the sum of the maximum items that can be selected with the capacity `M` and the count of indices where the maximum matches the index.**
