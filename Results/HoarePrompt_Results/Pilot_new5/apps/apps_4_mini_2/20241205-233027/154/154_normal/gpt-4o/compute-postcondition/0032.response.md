Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45). If `time_used` exceeds `M`, `complete_tasks` remains `n`, `points` remains 0, `remaining_time` is negative, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and (n - complete_tasks) * k, and `max_points` is max(max_points_current, points + subtasks_solved). The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
