Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45) and `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. `max_points` remains unchanged.***
