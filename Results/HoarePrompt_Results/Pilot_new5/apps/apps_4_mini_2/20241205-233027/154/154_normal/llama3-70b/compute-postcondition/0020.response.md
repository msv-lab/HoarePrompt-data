To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided state and the for loop. 

1. The loop statement shows that it iterates over `j` from 1 to `M`, inclusive.
2. The variable `M` is stated to be at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `M` must be at least 1.
3. The current value of `j` starts at 1, which is appropriate for the loop execution because the range starts from 1.
4. The state of `i` is `k + 1`, which suggests that it is ready for use within the loop, but doesn't directly impact the loop execution.

Given these points, we can summarize the required conditions for the loop to execute:

- `M` must be at least 1 for the loop to have valid iterations.
- The loop will start with `j` being 1.

Thus, the final state considering the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `j` is 1**.
