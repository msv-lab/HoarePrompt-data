Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is 1, `j` is `M`, and `dp[1][j]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[1][j - 1]` and `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[1][j - 1]`. The final value of `dp[1][M]` reflects the maximum items that can be selected given the constraints.**
