To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and how it relates to the requirements specified.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to partition a sequence of integers into two sequences `b` and `c` such that the difference `B - C` (where `B` is the sum of elements in `b` and `C` is the sum of elements in `c`) is maximized.

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    (b, c) = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
    print(b - c)
```

### Evaluation
The program sorts the list `a` in descending order and then alternates adding elements to `b` and `c` based on the index's parity (even index to `b`, odd index to `c`). 

### Edge Cases
1. **Single Element Case:** 
   - If `n=1` and `a=[5]`, the program will compute `b=5` and `c=0`, resulting in `5 - 0 = 5`. This is correct.
   - If `n=1` and `a=[-5]`, it computes `b=-5` and `c=0`, resulting in `-5 - 0 = -5`. This is still correct.
   
2. **All Negative Elements:**
   - For `n=3` and `a=[-1, -2, -3]`, after sorting we have `[-1, -2, -3]`. The program will assign `b=-1` and `c=-2`, resulting in `-1 - (-2) = 1`. The maximum possible value of `B - C` is indeed `1`, which is correct.
   
3. **Mixed Elements:**
   - For `n=3` and `a=[1, -2, 0]`, after sorting we have `[1, 0, -2]`. The program assigns `b=1` and `c=0`, resulting in `1 - 0 = 1`. However, the maximum value of `B - C` can be achieved by taking `b={1, 0}` and `c={-2}`, which gives `B=1` and `C=-2`, leading to `B - C = 3`. The program fails to compute the correct maximum for this input.
   
4. **All Zeroes:**
   - If `n=3` and `a=[0, 0, 0]`, the result will be `0 - 0 = 0`, which is correct.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case where simply alternating the assignment of values to `b` and `c` does not yield the optimal difference `B - C`. Specifically, it fails to maximize the difference when there are mixed positive and negative numbers. Given the example with input `[1, -2, 0]`, the program outputs an incorrect result.

Correctness: **False**.
