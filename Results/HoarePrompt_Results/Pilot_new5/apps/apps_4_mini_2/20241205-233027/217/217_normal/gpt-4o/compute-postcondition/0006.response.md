The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100. The functionality of the function, based on the provided constraints and relationships, is not specified in the output. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific return values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n integers (-100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100).**
