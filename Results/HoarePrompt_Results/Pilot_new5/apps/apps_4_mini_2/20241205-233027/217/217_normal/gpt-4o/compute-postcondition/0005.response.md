The code snippet `print(result)` does not change any variable values; it merely outputs the value of `result`. The precondition states that `result` is equal to `B - C`, where `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a` and `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`. As such, the value of `result` remains unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`; `result` is equal to `B - C`, and the value of `result` has been printed.**
