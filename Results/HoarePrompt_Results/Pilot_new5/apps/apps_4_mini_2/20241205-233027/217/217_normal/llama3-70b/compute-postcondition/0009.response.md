Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order. If `i` is an even integer, `b` is equal to the previous value of `b` plus `a[i]`, `c` is set to 0, and `i` is 0. If `i` is an odd integer, `b` remains 0, and `c` is equal to the previous value of `c` plus `a[i]`, with `i` being an odd integer.***
