The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is an odd integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, the value added to `c` is specifically `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `c + a[i]`, `i` is an odd integer.**
