Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, `b` and `c` remain unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `i` is even, an IndexError occurs due to accessing out of bounds of the list `a`. If `i` is odd, an IndexError occurs due to accessing `a[n]`.***
