Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the maximum possible value of B - C as specified in the problem description. 

### Explanation of the Issue:

1. **Approach**: The logic used in the program attempts to partition the array into two sequences `b` and `c` by assigning elements at even indices of the sorted array to `b` and those at odd indices to `c`. This method does not guarantee the maximum possible value of `B - C`.

2. **Counterexample**: Consider the input:
   ```
   5
   1 2 3 4 5
   ```
   When sorted in reverse, the array becomes `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. According to the program:
   - `b = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9` (elements at indices 0, 2, 4)
   - `c = 4 + 2 = 6` (elements at indices 1, 3)
   - Thus, B - C = 9 - 6 = 3.

   However, the optimal partition would be to take all elements in `b` and leave `c` empty:
   - `b = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}` yielding B = 15.
   - `c = {}` yielding C = 0.
   - Thus, B - C = 15 - 0 = 15, which is greater than 3.

3. **General Case**: The program does not consider all possible combinations of partitioning into `b` and `c`. The maximum difference B - C can be achieved by taking all positive numbers in `b` and all negative numbers in `c`. The current implementation fails to capture this strategy, leading to suboptimal results.

In summary, the partitioning method used in the program is not comprehensive and does not always yield the maximum difference B - C as required by the problem description.
