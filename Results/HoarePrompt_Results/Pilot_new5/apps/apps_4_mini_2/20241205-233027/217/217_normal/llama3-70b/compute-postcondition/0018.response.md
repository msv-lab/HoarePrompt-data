After analyzing the provided code and the loop's behavior, here is the derived output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing:

Output State: **`b` is equal to the sum of all elements at even indices of `a`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements at odd indices of `a`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order.**
