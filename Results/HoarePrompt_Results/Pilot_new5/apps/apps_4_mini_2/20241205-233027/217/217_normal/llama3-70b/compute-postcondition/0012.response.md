The code `c += a[i]` updates the value of `c` by adding the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, which is within the bounds of the list `a` (since `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`), the operation will access the next index outside the valid range of `a` because list indices in Python are 0-based. Thus, `a[n]` will lead to an `IndexError`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged in the output state because the operation cannot be completed successfully.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, `b` and `c` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, and an IndexError occurred due to accessing `a[n]`.**
