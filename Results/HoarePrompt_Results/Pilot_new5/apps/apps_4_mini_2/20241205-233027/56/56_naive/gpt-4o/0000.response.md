To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step and check for potential edge cases.

The provided code defines a function `func_1(n, k)` that attempts to find a sequence of integers such that their powers of two sum to `n`, with a total length of `k`. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Check if `k` is greater than `n`:** If the length `k` is greater than `n`, then it is impossible to construct such a sequence since the minimum sum with `k` integers (considering all zeros) cannot exceed `0`. Thus, it correctly returns 'No' in this case.

2. **Extracting Bits:** The program extracts the positions of set bits in the binary representation of `n` (which correspond to `2^i` terms that can be used to sum to `n`).

3. **Check if the number of bits is more than `k`:** If the number of bits (i.e., the powers of two) is more than `k`, it's impossible to create a valid sequence of length `k`, so it returns 'No'.

4. **Adjusting the Length of the Sequence:** If there are fewer bits than `k`, the program tries to expand the list of bits by replacing the smallest bit with two smaller bits (i.e., `smallest - 1`). This process continues until the length of `bits` is equal to `k`. 

5. **Sorting for Lexicographical Order:** Finally, it sorts the bits in descending order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically largest.

### Potential Issues:
- When `k` is greater than the number of set bits in `n`, the program checks if it can create more bits by breaking existing ones down into smaller powers. However, there is a scenario that needs careful handling:
  - If `n` is a power of two (e.g., `n = 8`, `k = 4`), it has only one set bit. The process would generate negative powers (which are valid but not explicitly accounted for in the inputs) if `k` is much larger than the number of bits. For example, for `n = 8` (which is `2^3`), the program will try to break it down into `3`s and `-1`s. 
  - This is evident in the input `1 2`, where it properly generates `-1 -1`, which showcases that the program does indeed handle negative powers.

### Further Verification:
To validate the function, let's consider an example:
- For `n = 13` and `k = 2`:
  - The bits extracted from `13` (binary `1101`) are `3` (for `2^3`), `2` (for `2^2`), and `0` (for `2^0`).
  - The problem states there should be 2 numbers. The available combinations do not sum to `13` in just 2 parts, hence 'No' is correctly returned.

### Conclusion:
After thorough inspection, the code appears to handle the requirements of the problem description adequately, and I cannot find a case where it fails to meet the conditions outlined in the problem statement.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
