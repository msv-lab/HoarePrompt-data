Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. If `n` is less than `k`, then 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, if `n` is 0, `i` equals the number of loop iterations; if the length of `a` is less than `k`, then `a` contains the recorded highest powers of 2 used in each iteration. If the length of `a` is equal to or greater than `k`, then `a` contains `k` sorted highest powers of 2 in descending order and 'Yes' has been printed.***
