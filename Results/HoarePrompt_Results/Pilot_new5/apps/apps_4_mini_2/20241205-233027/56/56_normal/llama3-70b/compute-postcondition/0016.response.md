The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `i` is increased by 1; `x` is at least 1 (specifically `n.bit_length() - 1`) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
