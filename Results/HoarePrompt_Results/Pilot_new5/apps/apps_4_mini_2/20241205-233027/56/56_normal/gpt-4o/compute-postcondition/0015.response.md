Postcondition: ***`bits` contains the list of indices of the set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n` from 0 to 60, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. If `n` has no set bits, `bits` remains an empty list. The current length of `bits` is greater than `k`.***
