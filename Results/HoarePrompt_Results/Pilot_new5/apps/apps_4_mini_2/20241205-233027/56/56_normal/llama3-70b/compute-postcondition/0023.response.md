The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is at least 1, `a` contains the value of `x` appended to it, `n` is `n - 2`, and `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
