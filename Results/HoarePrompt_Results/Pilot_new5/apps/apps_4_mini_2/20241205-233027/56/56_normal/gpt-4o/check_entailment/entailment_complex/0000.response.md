Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to fulfill the problem description. Here’s a breakdown of how and why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input values `n` and `k`, ensuring they are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). This allows it to handle valid input according to the problem statement.

2. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The first condition checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If it is, it returns "No" since it's impossible to express `n` as a sum of k integers when k exceeds n.
   - The second condition checks if the number of bits (set bits) in the binary representation of `n` is greater than `k`. In this case, it also returns "No", as it is impossible to create a sum of k powers of two when there are more bits than the allowed integers.

3. **Adjusting Bits**: 
   - If the bits in `n` are fewer than `k`, the program pops the smallest bit and duplicates it by appending `smallest - 1` twice. This effectively increases the count of integers while maintaining the sum of powers of two, which is crucial for forming the required sequence.
   - The adjustments ensure that the total count of integers in the result reaches `k`, and since it involves the largest available bit, this maintains the goal of minimizing the largest integer while enabling the creation of the sequence.

4. **Sorting and Output**: 
   - The final list of bits is sorted in descending order prior to output, ensuring that the result conforms to the lexicographically largest requirement when multiple valid sequences exist. This satisfies the problem’s condition about outputting the lexicographically largest sequence among those with the minimum maximum integer.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `n` has no bits set, fulfilling the requirement to output sequences that might contain negative indices (as seen in the example of `1 2` producing `-1 -1`).

The implementation encapsulates all conditions and requirements laid out in the problem description, ensuring that all paths lead to correct and valid outputs. Therefore, the program is indeed correct as it adheres to the specifications provided.
