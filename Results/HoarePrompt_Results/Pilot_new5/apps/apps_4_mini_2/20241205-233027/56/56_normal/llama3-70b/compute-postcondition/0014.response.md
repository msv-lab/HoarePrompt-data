According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer but has now been decreased by 2, meaning the new value of `n` is `previous n - 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 after the adjustment. This means that the previous value of `n` before the last iteration must have been at least 2, so that after subtracting 2, `n` is still greater than 0.

Thus, the required adjustment is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 before it was decreased. Other states do not need to be adjusted since `i` has already been increased by 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `i` is increased by 1**
