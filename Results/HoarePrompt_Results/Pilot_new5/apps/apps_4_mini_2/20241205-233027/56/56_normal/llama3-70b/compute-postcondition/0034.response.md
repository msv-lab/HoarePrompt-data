The code does not change the state of any variables; it simply prints 'Yes' to the output. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged, but we note that the print operation has occurred.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `i` is equal to the number of loop iterations, `a` contains the sorted first `k` recorded highest powers of 2 in descending order, and the length of `a` is now equal to `k`, and 'Yes' has been printed.**
