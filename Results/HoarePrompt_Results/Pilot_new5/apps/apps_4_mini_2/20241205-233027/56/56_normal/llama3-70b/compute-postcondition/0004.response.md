The code initializes an empty list `a`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The initial conditions of `n` and `k` continue to hold true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `a` is an empty list.**
