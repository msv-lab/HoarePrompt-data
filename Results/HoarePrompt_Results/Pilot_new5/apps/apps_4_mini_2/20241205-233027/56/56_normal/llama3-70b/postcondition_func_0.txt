The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), and checks if it is possible to express `n` as a sum of exactly `k` distinct powers of 2. If `n` is less than `k`, it outputs 'No'. If enough distinct powers can be formed, it prints 'Yes' and the `k` largest powers of 2 used, sorted in descending order. If not enough distinct powers can be formed, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any values, but directly prints the results.
