The list `a` is sorted in place in descending order due to the `sort(reverse=True)` method. The length of `a` is `k`, and its previous values are now rearranged in such a way that the highest powers of 2 are at the front of the list. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `i` is equal to the number of loop iterations, `a` contains the sorted first `k` recorded highest powers of 2 in descending order, and the length of `a` is now equal to `k`.**
