To determine whether the annotated Python program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, we will analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. The length of `s` is guaranteed to be equal to `n` and can include characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

2. **Counting Nucleotides:**
   - The program initializes a dictionary `count` to keep track of how many of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') are present in the string `s`. It iterates through `s`, incrementing the corresponding counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', while ignoring '?' characters.

3. **Calculating Required Counts:**
   - The program calculates the average count `avg` of each nucleotide type that is required for the genome to be balanced, which is `n // 4`. It then adjusts the `count` dictionary, setting it to represent how many more of each nucleotide type are needed to reach `avg`.

4. **Building the Result String:**
   - The program initializes an empty result string `res`. It then iterates through `s` again, replacing '?' with the required nucleotides from the `count` using a nested loop. For each '?', it checks each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in turn and appends it to `res` if there is still a need for that nucleotide (i.e., `count[nc] > 0`).

5. **Final Check and Output:**
   - After attempting to replace all '?', the program checks if all counts in `count` are zero. If any are greater than zero, it outputs "===" indicating that it is not possible to balance the nucleotides. Otherwise, it outputs the completed string `res`.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- The program correctly counts existing nucleotides and calculates how many more are needed for each type.
- It then adequately replaces '?' based on the required counts, ensuring the final string contains equal numbers of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' when possible.
- Importantly, it outputs "===" when it's not possible to achieve the balance, which meets the requirement stated in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all aspects of the problem description and can handle edge cases as outlined. Therefore, it meets all necessary requirements.

Correctness: **True**
