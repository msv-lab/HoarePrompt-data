Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with non-negative integers. If `count['A']` is greater than 0, then `count['A']` is decremented by 1 (but remains non-negative), `res` includes 'A', and we exit the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur since there is no else part.***
