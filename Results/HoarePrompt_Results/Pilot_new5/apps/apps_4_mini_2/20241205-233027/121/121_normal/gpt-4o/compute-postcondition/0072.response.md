Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `result` is a list of length `n` with `result[i]` equal to `char`, `i` is the number of unique characters added to `result`, `counts` has at least 1 element, and if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, remaining less than `target_count`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
