Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count` is {'A': avg - x - 1, 'C': avg - y - 1, 'G': avg - z - 1, 'T': avg - w}; `s` is a non-empty string; `c` is '?'; `nc` is 'G'; if `count['G']` is greater than 0, `res` is updated by appending 'G' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
