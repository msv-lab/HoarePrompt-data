Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Handling Excess Characters**: The program correctly checks if any of the nucleotide counts exceed `n // 4`. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where there are excess unrecognized nucleotides ('?') remaining after filling in the required counts. If there are more '?' than needed to balance the nucleotide counts (i.e., if there are fewer than expected nucleotides of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'), the program will fill in the '?' but may leave some '?' unfilled if any nucleotide type has already reached the target count. This is contrary to the problem description, which states that it should be possible to decode the genome. If the target cannot be achieved, it should print "===".

2. **Final Validation**: After replacing the '?' in the string, the program does not validate whether the resulting string has exactly `n // 4` occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. It only ensures that no count exceeds `n // 4`. However, it is possible to have a string with fewer than `n // 4` of each type but still pass the initial checks and produce an incorrect output.

3. **Output Requirement**: The output requirement in the problem states that if it is not possible to decode the genome correctly, the output should be "==="; however, the current implementation does not guarantee this condition is checked after all `?` have been processed.

In summary, while the program attempts to follow the logic of the problem description, it fails to enforce the necessary conditions to ensure that the resulting counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are exactly equal to `n // 4`. Consequently, it does not handle certain cases appropriately, leading to potential incorrect outputs.
