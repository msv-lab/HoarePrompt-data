The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` must be a multiple of 4. If `n` is not a multiple of 4, it outputs '===' and terminates without returning any value. It counts the occurrences of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` and checks if any of these counts exceed `n // 4`; if they do, it outputs '===' and terminates. If the counts are within the allowed limit, it replaces any '?' in `s` with characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' until each of these characters appears at most `n // 4` times. Finally, it prints the modified string. In cases where there are more '?' than needed characters, those '?' remain unchanged. The function does not return any value.
