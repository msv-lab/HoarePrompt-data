Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count` is {'A': avg - x, 'C': avg - y, 'G': avg - z, 'T': avg - w}; `s` is a non-empty string; `c` is '?'; `res` contains the characters corresponding to all positive counts in `count`, and the final counts in `count` are {'A': avg - x - a, 'C': avg - y - b, 'G': avg - z - c, 'T': avg - w - d} where a, b, c, d represent the number of times 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' were appended to `res`. If no characters could be appended, `res` remains unchanged.**
