Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 4 <= n <= 255) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`, calculates the average number of each nucleotide required to balance their counts, and attempts to replace '?' in `s` with the necessary characters. If it is not possible to balance the counts (i.e., if any nucleotide count remains positive after replacements), it prints '===', otherwise, it prints the modified string `res`. If `s` only contains '?' characters, `count` will not be able to zero out, resulting in '===' being printed.**
