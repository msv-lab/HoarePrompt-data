Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count` is {'A': avg - x - 1, 'C': avg - y - 1, 'G': avg - z, 'T': avg - w}; `s` is a non-empty string; `c` is '?'; `nc` is 'C'; if `count['C']` is greater than 0, then `res` is updated by appending 'C' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
