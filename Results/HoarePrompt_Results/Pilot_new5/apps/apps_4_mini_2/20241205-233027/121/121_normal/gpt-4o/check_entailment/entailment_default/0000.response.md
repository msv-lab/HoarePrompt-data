To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we can analyze the logic and edge cases.

### Initial Assessment of the Code

1. **Input Validation**: 
   - The program checks if `n` (length of the genome) is a multiple of 4. If it isn't, it correctly outputs '===' and terminates, which aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Counting Nucleotides**:
   - The program counts occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. If any nucleotide count exceeds `n // 4`, it outputs '===' and terminates, as required.

3. **Replacing '?'**: 
   - The program then replaces '?' with the needed nucleotides while ensuring that no nucleotide appears more than `n // 4` times.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, replacing '?' with the appropriate character based on the counts.

### Edge Cases
- The code does not handle the case where there are more '?' than the total number of nucleotides needed to balance the counts. For example:
  - If the input is `4` and the genome is `????`, the output should be any combination of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' (like 'ACGT'), rather than leaving them as '?'.
  - If the input is `6` and the genome is `???G?`, it can replace '?' with nucleotides to reach the balanced count.

### Validation Against Output Hints
The output hints state:
- The function outputs '===' if `n` is not a multiple of 4 or any nucleotide count exceeds `n // 4`.
- It mentions that any remaining '?' might not get replaced if the required counts are already achieved.

The hints do not clarify that it should replace excess '?' when they can potentially form valid nucleotide compositions. This leads us to believe that there are cases where the program does not completely fulfill the problem description.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case where all '?' could be replaced to achieve a balanced result, particularly when they are in excess and could be replaced without exceeding the required counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation
The program does not correctly replace all '?' when it is possible to do so while ensuring that nucleotide counts remain balanced. For instance, an input of `4` with `????` should not result in '===' but should yield 'ACGT' or any valid permutation of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. Hence, the program does not adhere to the completeness required by the problem description.
