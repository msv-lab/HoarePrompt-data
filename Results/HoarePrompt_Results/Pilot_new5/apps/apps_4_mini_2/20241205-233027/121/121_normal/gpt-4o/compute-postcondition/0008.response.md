The variable `target_count` is assigned the value of `n // 4`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be a multiple of 4, the result of the integer division will be a positive integer. The values of `n` and `s` do not change, and the other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `data[0]` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255); `s` is equal to `data[1]`, which is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list of substrings derived from the input; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`.
