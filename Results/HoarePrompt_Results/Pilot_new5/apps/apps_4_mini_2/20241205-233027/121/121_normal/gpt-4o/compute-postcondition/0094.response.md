Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `result` contains characters from `s` with '?' replaced by characters from `counts` that are less than `target_count`, `counts` reflects the final counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' after all possible replacements, and each count in `counts` is less than or equal to `target_count`. If there were more '?' than available characters in `counts` that could be added, the remaining '?' in `result` will remain unchanged.**
