The variable `data` is assigned the value of the result of `input().split()`. The `input` function is designed to read all the input from the standard input and then `split()` divides the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Since `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', the exact contents of `data` will depend on the input provided during execution. However, the valid preconditions about `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `data` is a list of substrings derived from the input.**
