Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is {'A': avg - x, 'C': avg - y, 'G': avg - z, 'T': avg - w}, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is '?', `nc` is 'A', and `count[nc]` (which is `count['A']`) is greater than 0; `res` is updated by appending `nc`, resulting in `res += 'A'`.**
