The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `result` is a list of length `n` with `result[i]` equal to `char`, `i` is equal to the number of unique characters added to `result`, `counts` has at least 1 element, and `counts[char]` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
