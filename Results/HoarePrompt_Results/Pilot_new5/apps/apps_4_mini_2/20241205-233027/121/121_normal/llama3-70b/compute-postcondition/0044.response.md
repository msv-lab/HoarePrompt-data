Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is {'A': avg - x, 'C': avg - y, 'G': avg - z, 'T': avg - w}, and `s` is a non-empty string. If `c` is '?', `res` contains the characters corresponding to all positive counts in `count`, and the final counts in `count` are {'A': avg - x - a, 'C': avg - y - b, 'G': avg - z - c, 'T': avg - w - d}, where a, b, c, and d represent the number of times 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' were appended to `res`. If no characters could be appended, `res` remains unchanged. If `c` is not equal to '?', `res` is updated to include `c`.***
