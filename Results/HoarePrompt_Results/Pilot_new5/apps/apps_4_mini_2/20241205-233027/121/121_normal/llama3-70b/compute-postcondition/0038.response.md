The statement `count[nc] -= 1` decreases the value of `count` associated with the key `nc`, which is 'G'. Based on the initial state, `count['G']` is equal to `avg - z`. Therefore, after executing the code, `count['G']` will be updated to `avg - z - 1`.

The values of `n`, `avg`, `count`, `s`, `c`, and `res` remain unchanged except for `count['G']`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count` is {'A': avg - x - 1, 'C': avg - y - 1, 'G': avg - z - 1, 'T': avg - w}; `s` is a non-empty string; `c` is '?'; `nc` is 'G'; `res` is updated by appending 'G'.**
