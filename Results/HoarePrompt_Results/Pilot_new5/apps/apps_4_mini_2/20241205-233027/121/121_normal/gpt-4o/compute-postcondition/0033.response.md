Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `counts` is a dictionary containing counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. If `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, the program returns without any output. If `counts[char]` is not greater than `target_count`, no action is taken as there is no else part defined.***
