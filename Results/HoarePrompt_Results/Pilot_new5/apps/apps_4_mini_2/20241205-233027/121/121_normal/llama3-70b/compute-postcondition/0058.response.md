The value of `res` is increased by `nc`. The value of `nc` is defined as the next character in 'ACGT' that is not yet processed. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count` has been updated with `count[nc]` decreased by 1; `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character; `c` is the next character in `s`; `res` is increased by `nc`, `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT' that has not been processed.
