The variable `sergei_questions` is assigned a value based on `full_cycles`, `n`, and the expression `(2 * n - 2)`. The calculation involves an integer division and a condition checking if the remainder is greater than or equal to 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, as does the condition regarding `sergei_questions` depending on the value of `n`. The current value of `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`, but it doesn't impact the calculation of `sergei_questions`. Therefore, the output state maintains all original conditions while updating `sergei_questions`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; if `n` is greater than 1, then `sergei_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; the current value of `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`.**
