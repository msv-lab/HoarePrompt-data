The variable `direction` is assigned the value `1`. Other variables remain unchanged. The previous state indicates that `row` is -1, and the rest of the variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions`, `col`) retain their positive integer values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions` are positive integers decreased by 1, `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions` are positive integers, `direction` is 1, `row` is -1, `col` is 0.**
