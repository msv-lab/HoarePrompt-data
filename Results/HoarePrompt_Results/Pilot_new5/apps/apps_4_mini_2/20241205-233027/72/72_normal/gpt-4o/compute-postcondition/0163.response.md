The value of `row` is incremented by 2. The previous condition states that `row` was increased by `direction`, which is 1, so the new value of `row` will be its previous value plus 2. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `col`, and `max_questions` remain unchanged but must still be included in the output state. 

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than `col + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `col` is now `col + 1`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is now increased by 2 (previous value of `row` + 2), `direction` is 1**.
