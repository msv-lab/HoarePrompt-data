Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are greater than 2; `k` are positive integers greater than 1; if `direction` is -1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `n`, `row` is updated to either `row - 1` or `row + 1 - 2;` otherwise, if `direction` is 1, `max_questions` remains a positive integer greater than 1, and if `row` is -1, `row` is increased by 2. The values of `remaining_questions`, `_`, and `col` remain unchanged, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
