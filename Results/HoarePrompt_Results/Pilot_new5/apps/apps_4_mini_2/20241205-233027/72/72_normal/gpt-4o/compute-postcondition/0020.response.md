According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_questions`. For the loop to execute, `remaining_questions` must be at least 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` being positive integers do not directly affect the execution of the loop in this case. The variable `row` is initialized to 0 and `direction` is set to 1, which are also not directly influencing the loop execution. However, since the loop will use the variable `_`, we can assume it will hold the current iteration count.

So, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. At the start of the first iteration, `_` would be 0 since it will represent the current iteration count, starting from the beginning.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `row` is 0, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
