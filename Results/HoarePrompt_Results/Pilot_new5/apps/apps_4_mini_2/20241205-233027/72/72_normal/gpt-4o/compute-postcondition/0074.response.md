Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions` are positive integers, `direction` is 1, `row` is between 0 and `n-1`, `col` is 0. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their values. If `row` does not equal `x` or `col` does not equal `y`, the state of all variables remains unchanged.***
