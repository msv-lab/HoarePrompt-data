Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 0, and `k` is unchanged. If `direction` equals 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1 and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2`, `col` is set to 0, and `direction` is changed to -1, with `row` now equal to `n - 2`. Otherwise, if `direction` is not 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. If `row` is updated to 1, `col` is set to 0, and `direction` is changed to 1 if `row` is -1. If `row` is not -1, the variables maintain their respective states as described in the precondition. The `remaining_questions` is greater than 1 throughout the execution.***
