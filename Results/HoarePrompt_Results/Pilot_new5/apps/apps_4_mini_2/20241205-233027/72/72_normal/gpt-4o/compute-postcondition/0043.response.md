The impact of the code on the program is that `max_questions` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but their initial conditions still hold. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `max_questions`.

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 1; `k` are positive integers; `direction` equals 1 or -1; `row` is updated accordingly; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0; `_` is still 0; `col` is 1; if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.**
