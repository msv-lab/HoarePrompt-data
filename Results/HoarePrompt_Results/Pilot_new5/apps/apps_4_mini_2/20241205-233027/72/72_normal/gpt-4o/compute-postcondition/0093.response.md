`row` is incremented by the value of `direction`. The initial state indicates that `row` is equal to `n - 2`, so after the operation, `row` will be `n - 2 + direction`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are positive integers; `row` is equal to `n - 2 + direction`, `col` equals `m - 1`, and `max_questions` is now `max_questions + 1`.
