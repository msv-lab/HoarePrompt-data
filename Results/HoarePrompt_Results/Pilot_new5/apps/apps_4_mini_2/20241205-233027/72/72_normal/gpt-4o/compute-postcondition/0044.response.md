The value of `row` is incremented by `direction`. Therefore, the updated value of `row` will be `row + direction`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 1; `k` are positive integers; `direction` equals 1 or -1; `row` is `row + direction`; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0; `_` is still 0; `col` is 1; if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.**
