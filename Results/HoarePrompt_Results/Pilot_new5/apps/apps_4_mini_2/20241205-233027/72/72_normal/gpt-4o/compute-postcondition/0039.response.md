Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. If `direction` equals 1 and `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2`, `direction` is set to -1, and `max_questions` is incremented by 1 while `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0, `_` is still 0, and `col` is still 0. If `direction` does not equal 1 and `row` is equal to -1, then `row` is updated to 1, `direction` is set to 1, and `max_questions` is reduced by 1 while `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `_` is still 0, and `col` is still 0.***
