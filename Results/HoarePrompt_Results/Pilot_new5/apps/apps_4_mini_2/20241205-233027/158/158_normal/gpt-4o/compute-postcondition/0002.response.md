The value of `c` is assigned the value from `int(input())`, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The previous values of `b` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `c`. 

Output State: **`b` is a positive integer equal to `input integer`, `c` is an input integer, `a` is an input positive integer**.
