Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote based on the given ratios of lemons, apples, and pears (1:2:4). 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:** The program takes in the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c) as required.

2. **Calculating Maximum Useable Fruits:**
   - It correctly uses the formula `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` to determine the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) that can be used based on the available fruits. This ensures that the number of apples and pears available is sufficient to meet the required ratios.
   - The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that it correctly considers whole fruits only.

3. **Total Fruits Calculation:**
   - The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`. This is consistent with the requirement that for each lemon used, 2 apples and 4 pears are also used.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where not enough of one type of fruit is available. For example, if there are not enough pears, the minimum will return 0, resulting in a total of 0 fruits.

Based on these points, there are no identified issues with the program, and it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
