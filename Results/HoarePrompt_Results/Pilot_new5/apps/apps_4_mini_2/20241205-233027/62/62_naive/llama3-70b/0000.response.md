To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze its logic and see if it meets all specified requirements and handles all potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads input values for two numbers, X and Y, in their respective bases (b_x and b_y). It correctly uses `map(int, input().split())` to obtain the necessary integers.

2. **Digit Conversion**:
   - The function `func_1(digits, base)` is defined to convert the digits of each number from its base representation to its decimal form. It correctly implements the logic of multiplying the current result by the base and adding the next digit in each iteration.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The program compares the converted decimal values of X and Y. It outputs '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Edge Cases Considered
- The bases of X and Y are guaranteed to be different and within the valid ranges specified.
- The digits of X and Y are also guaranteed to be valid according to their bases, meaning no digits exceed their respective bases.

### Potential Issues
However, there is a significant issue with the comparison logic:

- The program does not handle the case where the number of digits differs between X and Y. For instance:
  - If X is `1 0 0` (which is 4 in base 2) and Y is `1` (which is 1 in base 10), then while converting both, it correctly identifies the values, but in a more straightforward implementation, it should check for the length of the digits as part of the comparison process before converting them to decimal. 
  - In the context of base representations, a number with fewer digits can still represent a larger value in certain cases (for example, comparing `10` in base 3 with `3` in base 10 is misleading without proper consideration).

### Conclusion
Since the implementation does not consider the scenario where the number of digits and the sizes of values in different bases could mislead the comparison (especially when one has leading zeros which are invalid), the code will incorrectly evaluate certain cases.

Therefore, I can conclude that:

Correctness: **False**. 

**Example of Failure**: An input like:
```
2 3
1 0
1 2
```
would lead the program to convert `10` from base 3 to 3 (which is correctly interpreted) and `2` from base 10 to 2. The output would be '>' while actually 3 > 2 is true, but without validating the digit lengths or their significance in respective bases beforehand, such ambiguities can arise in other configurations.
