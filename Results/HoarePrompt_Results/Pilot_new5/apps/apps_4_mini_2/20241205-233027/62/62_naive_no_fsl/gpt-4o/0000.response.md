To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers represented in different bases.

The input consists of two numbers, X and Y, represented in bases \( b_x \) and \( b_y \) respectively. The program reads the number of digits and the bases for both numbers, followed by the digits themselves. Then, it converts these digits into their decimal (base 10) equivalents using the function `func_1`, and finally compares the two decimal values.

### Analysis of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   The program correctly reads the input format as specified in the problem statement. It captures the number of digits, the base for each number, and the digits themselves.

2. **Conversion to Decimal:**
   The function `func_1` implements the conversion from the given base to decimal correctly. It uses the formula:
   \[
   \text{decimal\_value} = \text{decimal\_value} \times \text{base} + \text{digit}
   \]
   This is a standard way to convert a number from a base \( b \) to decimal, and it is correctly applied in a loop through the list of digits.

3. **Comparison Logic:**
   After converting both numbers to their decimal representations, the program compares them and prints the appropriate result ('<', '>', or '=').

### Checking Edge Cases:
- The program handles valid inputs as specified in the problem (no leading zeroes, valid digit ranges).
- Both \( b_x \) and \( b_y \) are constrained to be different bases, which is explicitly handled by the input constraints.
- The program does not check for invalid input values outside the specified range, but per the problem statement, such inputs will not be provided.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the intended logic for comparing two numbers in different bases as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent edge cases that break the functionality, given the constraints provided.

Therefore, the program is correct for all specified inputs.

Correctness: **True**
