Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, where each digit is between 0 and `base-1`, and an integer `base` that ranges from 2 to 40. It calculates and returns the decimal representation of the number formed by the `digits` in the given `base`. The function does not handle cases where `digits` contains invalid values (i.e., digits not in the range of 0 to `base-1`) or when `base` is outside the specified range. **
