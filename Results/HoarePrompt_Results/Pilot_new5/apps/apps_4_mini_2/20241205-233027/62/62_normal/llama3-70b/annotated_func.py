#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a given base, where each digit is between 0 and base-1, and base is an integer between 2 and 40.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is equal to the number represented by `digits` in the specified `base`, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40, `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of the number, where each digit is between 0 and base-1.
    return result
    #The program returns the value of 'result', which is the number represented by 'digits' in the specified 'base', where 'base' is an integer between 2 and 40, and 'digits' is a list of integers where each digit is between 0 and base-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, where each digit is between 0 and `base-1`, and an integer `base` that ranges from 2 to 40. It calculates and returns the decimal representation of the number formed by the `digits` in the given `base`. The function does not handle cases where `digits` contains invalid values (i.e., digits not in the range of 0 to `base-1`) or when `base` is outside the specified range.
