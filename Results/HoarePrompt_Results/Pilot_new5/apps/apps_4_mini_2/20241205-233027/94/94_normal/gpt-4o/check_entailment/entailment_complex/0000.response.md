Correctness: **False**

The provided implementation fails to correctly determine whether Bessie and Elsie's puzzles can be transformed into the same configuration. The critical issue lies in the logic that checks for reachable states. Specifically, the program uses a set to track all unique states generated from valid moves, but it lacks a mechanism to compare the reachable states of both puzzles in a comprehensive manner.

For example, consider the following input configurations:

```
Input:
AB
XC
AC
BX
```

In this case, the expected output is "NO" because Bessie can only reach configurations that do not include the configuration of Elsie's puzzle. However, the logic in `func_2` only checks if the starting states are reachable without ensuring that any configuration from Bessie's reachable states intersects with Elsie's reachable states. Consequently, the program may incorrectly return "YES" when it should return "NO".

Thus, since there are scenarios where the program does not correctly determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration, it fails to satisfy the problem requirements in every potential case.
