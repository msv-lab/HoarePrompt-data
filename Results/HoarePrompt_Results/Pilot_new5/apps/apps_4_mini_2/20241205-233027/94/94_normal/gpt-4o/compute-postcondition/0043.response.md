The `empty_row` and `empty_col` variables are assigned values based on the division of `empty_pos` by 2. The `divmod` function returns two values: the quotient (which becomes `empty_row`) and the remainder (which becomes `empty_col`). The exact values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` will depend directly on the value of `empty_pos`.

Since `empty_pos` is known to be the index of 'X' in `current`, its value will determine the outputs. Specifically, if `empty_pos` is 0, `empty_row` will be 0 and `empty_col` will be 0. If `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` will be 0 and `empty_col` will be 1. If `empty_pos` is 2, `empty_row` will be 1 and `empty_col` will be 0, and if `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` will be 1 and `empty_col` will be 1. 

The values of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, and `directions` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` is updated to reflect the removal of the first element; `visited` remains the same; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos % 2`.**
