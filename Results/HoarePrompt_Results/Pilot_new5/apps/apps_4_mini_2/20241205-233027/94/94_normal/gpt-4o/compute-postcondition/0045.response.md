The code assigns `new_row` and `new_col` the values based on the `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the direction offsets `dr` and `dc`. Since `dr` and `dc` would be picked from `directions`, the specific values of `new_row` and `new_col` depend on the current values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` along with the selected direction.

Given that `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, the new positions will be calculated based on those values. However, since `dr` and `dc` are not defined here, they would represent one of the four possible direction changes.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated, `visited` remains the same, `directions` contains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**.
