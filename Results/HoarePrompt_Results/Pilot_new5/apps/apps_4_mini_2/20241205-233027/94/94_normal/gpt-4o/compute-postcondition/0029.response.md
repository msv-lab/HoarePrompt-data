According to the code, the loop iterates over each direction specified in `directions`. The variables `dr` and `dc` will take on the values of the next direction from `directions` on each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 'ABCX', and the state of `queue` and `visited` has been determined by whether `new_state_str` was in `visited`. Since the values of `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `new_state` remain unchanged, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is the iteration over `directions`.

If the loop has executed `n` times and there are still more directions left in the `directions` list, then the next iteration will take the next direction. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `dr` and `dc` need to point to the next direction in `directions`.

Assuming `directions` has at least `n + 1` elements (where `n` is the number of times the loop has run), `dr` and `dc` will be updated to the next values in the list.

State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged; `dr` and `dc` are the next values in `directions`**.
