In the provided code snippet, the values of `new_state` are being modified. The variable `empty_pos` is not explicitly stated, but it refers to the current position of an empty cell in the context of a state (likely in a puzzle or grid scenario). The variables `dr` and `dc` are offsets that determine the new position based on the empty position.

1. `new_state[empty_pos]` is assigned the value of `new_state[new_pos]`, meaning the value that was at `new_pos` will move to `empty_pos`.
2. `new_state[new_pos]` is assigned the value of `new_state[empty_pos]`, meaning the value that was at `empty_pos` will move to `new_pos`.

The result is that the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

However, we know from the initial state that `start` is 'ABCX', which is likely the string representation of the current state. The variables `queue` and `visited` are not changed, but the updated state (`new_state`) now reflects this swap.

Since `new_state` is derived from `current`, which is likely equivalent to `start`, we can infer how the swap affects the state. The final output must represent the new situation after the swap, without knowing the specific characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.

Given that `empty_pos` can be derived from the context, but not explicitly stated, we will specify that:

- `new_state` will contain the characters of `start` with the positions of `empty_pos` and `new_pos` exchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is 'ABXC' (assuming empty_pos corresponds to the index of 'X' and new_pos corresponds to the index of 'C' after swapping). `queue` is updated with `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `new_pos` is updated based on the calculations done.**
