Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include valid `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is a valid state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is valid, `empty_row` is now `empty_row + dr`, `empty_col` is now `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state_str` is the concatenated string from `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.***
