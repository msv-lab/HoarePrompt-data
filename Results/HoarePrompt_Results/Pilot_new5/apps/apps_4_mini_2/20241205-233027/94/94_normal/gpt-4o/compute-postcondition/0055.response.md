Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not previously in `visited`, and `visited` now includes `new_state_str` if the new position is valid (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2). The `directions` remain as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`. If the new position is invalid, there is no change to `queue` or `visited`, and all other variables remain the same.***
