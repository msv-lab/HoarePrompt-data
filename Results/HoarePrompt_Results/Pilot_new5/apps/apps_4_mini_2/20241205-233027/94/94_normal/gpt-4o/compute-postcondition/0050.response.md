The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of the string created by joining the elements of the list `new_state`. The `new_state` list is a modified version of the `current` state after the swap operation is performed at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated, `visited` remains the same, `directions` contains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, and `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`.
