The value of `empty_pos` is assigned to the index of 'X' in the `current` string. The `current` state was removed from `queue`, which means it is no longer part of the queue but is still available as `current`. The value of `start`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remain unchanged. 

Given that `current` is the state that was removed from `queue` and the exact character string in `current` is not provided, we can only assert that `empty_pos` will be an integer representing the index of 'X' in that specific string.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` is updated to reflect the removal of the first element; `visited` remains the same; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` remains unchanged; `empty_col` remains unchanged.**
