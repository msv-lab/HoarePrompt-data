The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are lists of two strings, where each string contains two characters representing the tiles ('A', 'B', 'C') and an empty cell ('X'). The function checks if the sorted versions of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are equal. If they are equal, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of strings `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, and return `True` if they contain the same tiles and empty cell, regardless of their order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, puzzle1 and puzzle2, and returns True if the sorted contents of puzzle1 and puzzle2 are equal.**
