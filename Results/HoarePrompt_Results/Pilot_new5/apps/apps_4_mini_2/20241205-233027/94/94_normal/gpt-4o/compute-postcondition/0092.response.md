Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, and `new_state_str` is added to `queue` and `visited` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`. The `empty_row` and `empty_col` are updated based on the valid move direction, and `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, indicating the new position of the empty tile. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to `queue` or `visited`.***
