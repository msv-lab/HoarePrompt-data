The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` are not specified in the initial state, but they are involved in the calculation of `new_row` and `new_col`. The code assigns new values to `new_row` and `new_col` based on the direction vectors `dr` and `dc`. Therefore, the specific values of `new_row` and `new_col` depend on the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. 

Since `empty_row` and `empty_col` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine specific values for `new_row` and `new_col`, but we know that they will be calculated based on the formula:

`new_row = empty_row + dr`  
`new_col = empty_col + dc`

The overall state remains valid but is updated with the calculations for `new_row` and `new_col`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated with `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, and the direction will be the next valid move in `directions`, with a corresponding increment in the iteration index.**
