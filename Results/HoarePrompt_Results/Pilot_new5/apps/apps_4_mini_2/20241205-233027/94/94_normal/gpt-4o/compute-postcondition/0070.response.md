The code snippet swaps the values of `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. Given the initial state, we know:

1. `empty_pos` is 3, which corresponds to the 4th position in `new_state`.
2. `new_row` and `new_col` are computed by adding `dr` and `dc` to `empty_row` and `empty_col`, respectively. The specific values of `dr` and `dc` are not provided, so we can't compute `new_row` and `new_col` explicitly. However, we can denote them as `new_row = 1 + dr` and `new_col = 1 + dc`.
3. The variable `new_pos` is calculated as `(1 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`.

The swap operation changes the contents of `new_state` at the indices `empty_pos` (3) and `new_pos`, but we do not have the specific value of `new_pos` since it depends on `dr` and `dc`. However, we know that it will reference another position in `new_state`.

After the swap, other variables remain unchanged, and the output must reflect the change in `new_state`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values, `visited` includes `new_state_str`, `directions` remain [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is equal to `1 + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(1 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`, `new_state` has elements swapped at indices 3 and `new_pos`.**
