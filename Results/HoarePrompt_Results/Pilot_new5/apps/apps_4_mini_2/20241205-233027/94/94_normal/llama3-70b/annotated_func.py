#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are each a list of two strings, where each string contains two characters representing the tiles ('A', 'B', 'C') and an empty cell ('X'), and both lists contain exactly one of each tile and one empty cell.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are lists of two strings each containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True, as sorted(puzzle1) is equal to sorted(puzzle2) which are both ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each containing two strings with exactly one of each tile ('A', 'B', 'C') and one empty cell ('X'). It swaps the positions of 'X' between the two puzzles and returns True if the sorted contents of both puzzles are equal after the swap, meaning they contain the same tiles in any order. If the conditions of the inputs are not met (e.g., if the lists do not contain the expected characters or if they contain duplicates), the function's behavior is undefined but it assumes the inputs are valid as described.
