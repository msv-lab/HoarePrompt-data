The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. 

Given the initial state, `new_state_str` is being added to `queue`, which is a list. The variable `visited` is not changed by this operation, so the values related to `visited`, `start`, and `current` remain the same. Since `new_state_str` is only included in `visited` if it was not already present, we note that additional context about whether it was previously visited is not directly affected by this append operation. 

Thus, the overall state after executing the code will reflect that `new_state_str` is now part of the `queue`. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` now contains `new_state_str` (added); `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str`, if `new_state_str` was not already in `visited`; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is the result of swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`; `new_state_str` is the concatenated string of `new_state`.**
