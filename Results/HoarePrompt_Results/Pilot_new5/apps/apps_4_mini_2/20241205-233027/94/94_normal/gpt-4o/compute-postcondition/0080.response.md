The statement `empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)` takes the index of 'X' in `current`, which is stored in `empty_pos`, and computes the row and column indices of that position in a 2D grid representation. The `divmod` function returns a tuple containing the quotient and the remainder of the division of `empty_pos` by 2. This means `empty_row` will be the quotient (indicating which row 'X' is in), and `empty_col` will be the remainder (indicating the column).

Given that `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current` and since `current` is likely a 2x2 grid (as indicated by the use of 2 for the divisor), the values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` will directly reflect the position of 'X'.

The other variables (`start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include all valid `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the last state removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.**
