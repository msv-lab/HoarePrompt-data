Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated, `visited` remains the same, `directions` contains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.***
