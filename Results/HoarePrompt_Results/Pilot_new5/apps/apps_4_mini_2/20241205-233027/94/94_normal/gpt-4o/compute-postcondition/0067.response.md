The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` currently hold the values 1 and 1, respectively. The values of `dr` and `dc` refer to the direction offsets which will be added to `empty_row` and `empty_col` to calculate `new_row` and `new_col`. It is implied that `dr` and `dc` come from the `directions` list. 

However, since the specific values of `dr` and `dc` are not provided in the current context, we cannot determine the exact values of `new_row` and `new_col`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `new_row` and `new_col` are determined by adding the values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` to their respective offsets `dr` and `dc`.

The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output will include all valid information.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values, `visited` includes `new_state_str`, `directions` remain [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 1 + `dr`, `new_col` is 1 + `dc`.**
