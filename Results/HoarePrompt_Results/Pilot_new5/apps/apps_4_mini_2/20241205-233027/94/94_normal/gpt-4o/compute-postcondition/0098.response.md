The line of code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` creates a string from the list `new_state`. The initial state of `new_state` is 'ABXC'. Therefore, after executing this code, `new_state_str` will hold the value 'ABXC'.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, including `start`, `visited`, `queue`, and `new_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is 'ABXC', `new_state_str` is 'ABXC', `queue` is updated with `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `new_pos` is updated based on the calculations done.**
