Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key points that lead to this conclusion:

1. **Invalid Input Handling**: The program assumes that the input format is always valid (i.e., each puzzle will always contain exactly one of each tile and one empty cell). However, the problem description states that the puzzles consist of a 2x2 grid. The way `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are constructed (`puzzle1 = [input() + input()]`) leads to a list containing a single string of concatenated inputs. As a result, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` will be strings, not lists of two strings, which will lead to incorrect indexing later in the code.

2. **Incorrect Indexing**: In the line `for i in range(4):`, the code attempts to access indices from `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, but since they are incorrectly structured as single strings, this would lead to incorrect behavior when trying to find the index of 'X'. The indices used will not correctly correspond to the positions in a 2x2 grid.

3. **Logic for Tiles Matching**: The logic in `func_1` checks if the sorted tiles of both puzzles match after swapping the positions of 'X'. However, the problem requires determining if they can reach the same configuration through a series of valid moves (sliding tiles into the empty space). Simply checking if their sorted contents are equal after a swap does not account for the specific moves allowed in the sliding puzzle, potentially allowing configurations to match that cannot actually be reached through valid gameplay.

Given these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description, particularly in how it processes the puzzles and checks for matching configurations through valid moves. Thus, the output must be `False`.
