Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values, if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`, `visited` is updated to include `new_state_str`, and other variables remain unchanged; if `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
