Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include all valid `new_state_str` generated during the iterations, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the last state removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the last `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`. If no valid moves were possible, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged from their initial state, and all other variables remain the same.**
