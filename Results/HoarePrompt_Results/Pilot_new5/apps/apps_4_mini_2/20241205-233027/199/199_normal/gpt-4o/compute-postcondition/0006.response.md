The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `n - 2 * (a + b)`. Given the initial state, where `n` is at least 8, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1, we can calculate `rem` as follows:

1. Calculate `a + b`: 
   - `a + b = 1 + 1 = 2`
  
2. Calculate `2 * (a + b)`:
   - `2 * (a + b) = 2 * 2 = 4`
   
3. Therefore, `rem` becomes:
   - `rem = n - 4`

Since `n` must be at least 8, `rem` will be at least `8 - 4 = 4`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 8, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and `rem` is at least 4 (specifically, `rem` is equal to `n - 4`).

Output State: **`n` must be at least 8, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and `rem` is equal to `n - 4`.**
