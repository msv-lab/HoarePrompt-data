The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `count` is 2, after the operation `count += 1`, the new value of `count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 12; `count` is 3; `a` is 3; `b` is 3; `rem` is `n - 12`, which is 0 if `n` is 12, or positive if `n` is greater than 12.**
