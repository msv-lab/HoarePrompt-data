To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and whether it correctly counts the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.

### Analysis of the provided program:

1. **Input and Constraints**:
   - The input `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9 \).
   - The minimum length for a valid split into four positive parts is `6`, as each part must be at least `1`.

2. **Logic for Splitting**:
   - The program aims to find pairs of lengths, denoted as `a` and `b`, where `2a + 2b = n`.
   - The remaining length `rem` is calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`.
   - For the remaining length `rem` to be split into two equal parts (`rem // 2`), it must be positive and even.
   - Furthermore, to ensure that a square is not formed, it checks that `a` should not be equal to `rem // 2`.

3. **Iterating through possible values**:
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n // 4`, trying to form pairs (a, b) such that their total with the remaining length forms a rectangle.
   - The count is incremented for each valid configuration.

### Validity of the Program:
- The program correctly identifies pairs of lengths that can form rectangles based on the constraints given in the problem description.
- It correctly avoids counting configurations that would result in a square by ensuring that `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`.

### Cases to Consider:
- For `n = 6`, the valid configuration is {1, 1, 2, 2}, which matches the output `1`.
- For `n = 20`, the configurations are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7}, and {4, 4, 6, 6} â€” resulting in an output of `4`, which is also correct.

Given this analysis, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described, counting the ways to split the stick while adhering to the constraints of forming rectangles and avoiding squares.
