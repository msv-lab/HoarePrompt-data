The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the count of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b = n / 2` with `a < b`. It iterates over possible values of `a` and `b`, ensuring they are distinct and positive integers. If no valid pairs exist, the function returns 0. The function only works for values of `n` that are even since `n / 2` must be an integer for valid pairs to exist. If `n` is odd, it will always return 0, as there can be no valid pairs.
