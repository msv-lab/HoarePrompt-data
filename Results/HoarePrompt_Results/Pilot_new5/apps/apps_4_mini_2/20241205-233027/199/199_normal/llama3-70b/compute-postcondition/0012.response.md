Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `ways` is the number of pairs (a, b) such that `a` is 1, `b` is in the range [1, (n - 1) // 2] and `2 * (a + b) == n`, `a` is 1, `b` will be the last value it took in the loop iteration if the loop executed, or the range limit otherwise. If the loop does not execute, `ways` remains 0.**
