To determine the required states for the loop to execute, we will analyze the provided information.

1. The loop iterates `a` from 1 to `n // 2`. 
2. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `a` (which is 1) must be less than or equal to the ending value (`n // 2`).
3. Therefore, `n // 2` must be at least 1, which implies that `n` must be at least 2 (since `n` is at least 1, `n // 2` is 0 for `n = 1`, and this wouldn't allow the loop to execute).

Now, let's define the states:

- `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute (hence `n // 2` is at least 1).
- The loop variable `a` will start at 1, but we also need to consider that its initial value will be 1 when the loop begins.

Thus, the adjusted states are:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1**
