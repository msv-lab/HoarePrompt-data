According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `a`. The loop will iterate as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // 4`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 8, which means `n // 4` is at least 2. The value of `a` is currently 1.

To execute one more time, the range of `a` must allow for it to take on the next value, which would be 2. Since `a` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` needs to be incremented to 2.

Thus, the updated states will be: 
- `n` remains unchanged as it is at least 8.
- `count`, `a`, `b`, and `rem` also remain unchanged for this iteration since the conditions allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `a` is now 2.

State: **`n` is at least 8, `count` is 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, and `rem` is equal to `n - 4`**
