In this situation, `rem` is assigned the value of `n - 2 * (a + b)`. Given the initial values, we can compute the new value of `rem`.

1. The value of `a` is 2 and the value of `b` is also 2, so `a + b` equals 4.
2. Therefore, `2 * (a + b)` equals `2 * 4`, which is 8.
3. Now, we can express `rem` as `n - 8`.

Since `n` is at least 8, `rem` will be `n - 8`. The value of `rem` will depend on the specific value of `n`, but it will be non-negative.

Other variables (`n`, `count`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is at least 8, `count` is 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `rem` is equal to `n - 8`.**
