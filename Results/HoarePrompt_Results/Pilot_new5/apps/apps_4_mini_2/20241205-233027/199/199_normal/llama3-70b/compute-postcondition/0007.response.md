The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ways` was 1, so after executing the code, `ways` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `ways` is 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `ways` is 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 2**
