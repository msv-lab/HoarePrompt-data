The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial condition that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 remains valid. The variable `s` is unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is the input value, and 1 <= n <= 500; `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
