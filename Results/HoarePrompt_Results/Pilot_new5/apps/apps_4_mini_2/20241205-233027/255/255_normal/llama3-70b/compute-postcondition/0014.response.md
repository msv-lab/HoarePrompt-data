The `print(ans)` statement outputs the current value of `ans`. Since the value of `ans` is not changed by this line of code and is simply being printed, we maintain the previous state of `n` and `s`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 500), `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is the count of distinct adjacent characters in `s`, and `ans` has been printed.**
