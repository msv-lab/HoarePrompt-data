#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor 'a' of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of those two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It continues to swap the values of `a` and `b` until `b` becomes zero, at which point it returns the value of `a`, which represents the GCD of the original inputs. The function correctly handles the input constraints of 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by the value returned by func_1(a, b), where a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`, where both values are in the range of 1 to 10^9. It returns the result of `a` multiplied by `b` divided by the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`. However, if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0, this will cause a division by zero error, which is not handled in the function. Therefore, in cases where `func_1(a, b)` is 0, the function will raise an exception instead of returning a valid result.
