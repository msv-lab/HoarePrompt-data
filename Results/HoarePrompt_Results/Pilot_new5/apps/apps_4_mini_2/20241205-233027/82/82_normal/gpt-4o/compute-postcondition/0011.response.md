To simulate the execution of the given code snippet with the provided initial state, let's analyze the impact of the code.

Initial State:
- `a` is a positive integer
- `b` is a positive integer
- `diff` is `abs(a - b)`
- `min_lcm` is float('inf')
- `min_k` is 0
- `k` is 1
- `candidate` will iterate over [1, diff]
- `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`

The code snippet is:
```
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

Here, `current_lcm` will be assigned the result from `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The function `func_2` is not defined in the provided information, but it will take `new_a` and `new_b` as input.

Since `new_a` and `new_b` depend on the value of `candidate`, and `candidate` iterates over the range [1, diff], the actual values of `new_a` and `new_b` will change as `candidate` takes each value in this range. However, without specific values for `a` and `b`, we can't determine the exact result of `current_lcm`.

Regardless, we can state that:
- `current_lcm` is calculated based on the values of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Since the only variable that changes in this step is `current_lcm`, and the other variables retain their states, we acknowledge that `current_lcm` is now defined as the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is float('inf'), `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `candidate` will iterate over [1, diff], `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b)**.
