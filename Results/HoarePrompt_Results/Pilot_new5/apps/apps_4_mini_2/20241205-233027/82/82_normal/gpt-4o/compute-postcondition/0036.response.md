To assess the impact of the code snippet provided, we need to analyze the initial state of the variables and the effect of the invocation of the function `func_2`. 

1. The variables `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated based on `a`, `b`, and `candidate`. They are multiples of `candidate`.
2. The variable `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, which implies it will store the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Given that `func_2` is not defined in the provided information, we can only state that `current_lcm` will be some value based on `new_a` and `new_b`. 

Since `new_a` and `new_b` are still defined as multiples of `candidate`, we can maintain the relationships while indicating that `current_lcm` has been computed. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` must be at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` can be `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is a multiple of `candidate` equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is a multiple of `candidate` equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
