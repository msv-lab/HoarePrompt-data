#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It correctly computes the GCD even if `y` is initially 0, where it will return `x` as the GCD. Therefore, the function can handle cases where one or both inputs are 0 and still returns the appropriate GCD result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers greater than 0.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of the expression x multiplied by y divided by the result of func_1(x, y), where x and y are integers greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both greater than 0, and returns the result of the expression `x` multiplied by `y` divided by the result of `func_1(x, y)`. If `func_1(x, y)` returns 0, this would result in a division by zero error. Therefore, the function may raise an error if `func_1` does not handle its internal logic correctly or returns 0.

def func_3(a, b):

        #The program returns 0, since `a` and `b` are equal positive integers
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, and `a` is not equal to `b`
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if (current_lcm < min_lcm or current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate <
                    min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. If the loop executed, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated for all valid candidates, with `min_k` as the candidate that provided this minimum value. If the loop did not execute, `min_lcm` is float('inf') and `min_k` is 0.
    return min_k
    #The program returns min_k, which is the candidate that provided the minimum least common multiple of new_a and new_b if the loop executed; otherwise, it returns 0 if the loop did not execute.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It returns `0` if `a` and `b` are equal. If they are not equal, it calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, finds candidates based on the factors of this difference, computes `new_a` and `new_b` for those candidates, and calls another function `func_2` to find the least common multiple (LCM). Finally, it returns the candidate that results in the minimum LCM. If no valid candidates are found, it defaults to returning `0`.
