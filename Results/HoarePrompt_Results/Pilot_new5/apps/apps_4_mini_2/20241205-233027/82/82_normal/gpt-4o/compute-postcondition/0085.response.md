Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It returns `0` if `a` and `b` are equal. If they are not equal, it calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, finds candidates based on the factors of this difference, computes `new_a` and `new_b` for those candidates, and calls another function `func_2` to find the least common multiple (LCM). Finally, it returns the candidate that results in the minimum LCM. If no valid candidates are found, it defaults to returning `0`. **
