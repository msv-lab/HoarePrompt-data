In the given code snippet, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The initial state provides the necessary context:

- `a` is a positive integer
- `b` is a positive integer
- `diff` is calculated as `abs(a - b)`
- `current_lcm` is previously the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` but will be updated
- `k` is 1
- `candidate` is `diff`
- `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`
- `new_b` is defined as the smallest multiple of `diff` greater than or equal to `b`

The values of `new_a` and `new_b` will be determined based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `diff`. `current_lcm` will now reflect the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `k` is 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff` greater than or equal to `b`.**
