The variable `new_b` is assigned the value of the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. Given that `b` is a positive integer and `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, the value of `new_b` will be calculated based on these conditions.

Thus:
- `new_b` becomes `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the Output State includes all preconditions that are still valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` must be either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is less than or equal to `min_lcm`, `min_k` is either `candidate` or remains unchanged, `new_b` is updated to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
