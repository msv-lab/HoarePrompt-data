To determine the output state, we will analyze the impact of the given code snippet on the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a positive integer.
   - `b` is a positive integer.
   - `diff` is `abs(a - b)`.
   - `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `candidate` is `diff`.
   - `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` assigns a new value to `new_b`.
   - Since `candidate` is equal to `diff`, we can replace `candidate` with `diff` for clarity.
   - The calculation effectively rounds up `b` to the nearest multiple of `diff`.

3. **New Value Calculation**:
   - The new value of `new_b` is calculated as:
     \[
     new\_b = \left(\frac{b + diff - 1}{diff}\right) \times diff
     \]
   - This means that `new_b` is now the smallest multiple of `diff` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

4. **Output State Construction**:
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `current_lcm`, and `k` remain unchanged.
   - The variable `new_b` has now been updated.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b), `k` is 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff` greater than or equal to `b`.**
