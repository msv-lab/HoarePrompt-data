The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, and `new_b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(a, b)`; `k` is 1; `candidate` is 1; `new_a` is equal to `a`; `new_b` is equal to `b`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(a, b)`; `k` is 1; `candidate` is 1; `new_a` is equal to `a`; `new_b` is equal to `b`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
