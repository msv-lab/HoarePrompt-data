`new_a` is assigned the value of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, which calculates the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`. The value of `candidate` is 2, so `new_a` becomes the nearest multiple of 2 that is greater than or equal to `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is 2, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b).**
