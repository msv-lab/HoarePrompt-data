To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the functionality of the program and compare it to the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Objective**: Find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.
2. **Input Constraints**: The inputs \( a \) and \( b \) are both positive integers within the range \( 1 \le a, b \le 10^9 \).
3. **Output**: Print the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) that achieves the minimum LCM.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
2. **Function Definitions**:
   - **func_1**: Calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct.
   - **func_2**: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) using the relationship \( \text{lcm}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{gcd}(x, y)} \), which is also correct.
   - **func_3**: The main function where the logic for finding the optimal \( k \) occurs.
3. **Logic in func_3**:
   - If \( a \) is equal to \( b \), it correctly identifies that \( k = 0 \) is the optimal solution since \( \text{lcm}(a, b) \) would be minimized (both would be equal).
   - The function calculates the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \) and then iterates through divisors of this difference to find potential values for \( k \).
   - For each candidate divisor \( k \), it calculates \( new\_a \) and \( new\_b \) such that both \( new\_a \) and \( new\_b \) are the smallest multiples of \( k \) greater than or equal to \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - It calculates the LCM of these adjusted values and keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding candidate \( k \).

### Correctness Evaluation
The program correctly follows the steps required to find the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \):
- It considers both \( a \) and \( b \) being equal, which directly leads to the output of \( k = 0 \).
- It effectively iterates through all divisors of the difference \( |a - b| \), which is crucial since the LCM is influenced by these values.
- The logic to adjust \( a \) and \( b \) to the nearest multiples of \( k \) ensures that it is checking the right candidates.
- The selection and updating of \( min_lcm \) and \( min_k \) correctly ensures that if there are multiple \( k \) yielding the same LCM, the smallest \( k \) is chosen.

### Conclusion
Since the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, we can conclude its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
