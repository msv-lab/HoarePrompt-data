`min_lcm` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This change does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `diff`. Therefore, the output state captures the updated value of `min_lcm` while retaining the original conditions for `a`, `b`, and `diff`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is float('inf')**
