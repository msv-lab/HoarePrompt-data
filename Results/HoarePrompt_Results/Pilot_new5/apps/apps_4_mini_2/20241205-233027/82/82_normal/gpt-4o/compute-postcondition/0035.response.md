The value of `new_b` is assigned as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The value of `candidate` can either be `2` or `diff // 2`. Since `diff` must be at least `2`, and both `a` and `b` are positive integers, `new_b` will be a multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. The states of `a`, `diff`, `k`, and `candidate` remain unchanged, so the output state captures the new value of `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` must be at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` can be `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is a multiple of `candidate` equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is a multiple of `candidate` equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
