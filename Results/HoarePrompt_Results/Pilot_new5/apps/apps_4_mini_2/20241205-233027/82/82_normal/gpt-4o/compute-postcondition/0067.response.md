The variable `new_a` is assigned the value calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, which finds the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `candidate`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, and `min_k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` must be either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is less than or equal to `min_lcm`, `min_k` is either `candidate` or remains unchanged, `new_a` is updated to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`**.
