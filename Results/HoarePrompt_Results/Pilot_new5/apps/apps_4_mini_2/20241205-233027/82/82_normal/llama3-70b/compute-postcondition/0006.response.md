The loop implements the Euclidean algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two integers `a` and `b`. The loop continues executing as long as `b` is not zero. 

- After the first execution, `a` becomes the original value of `b`, and `b` becomes the original value of `a % b`, which is a positive integer less than the original value of `b`.
- After each subsequent iteration, `a` takes on the previous value of `b`, while `b` is updated to `a % b`, continuing to decrease until `b` eventually reaches zero.

If `b` was greater than zero to begin with, the loop will execute until `b` becomes zero, and at that point, `a` will hold the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`**
