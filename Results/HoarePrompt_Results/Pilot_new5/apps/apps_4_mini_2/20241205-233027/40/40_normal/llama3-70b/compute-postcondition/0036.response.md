Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is greater than 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the character at index 2 of `s`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse (i.e., `substr` is not equal to `substr[::-1]`).***
