According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index `i`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `n`.**
