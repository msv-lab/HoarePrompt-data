The value of `max_len` is updated using the maximum of its previous value and the length of `substr`. The previous value of `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, and `substr` is defined as `s[1:3]`, which has a length of 2 since it takes two characters from string `s`. 

Therefore, whether `max_len` will remain the same or be updated will depend on its previous value. If `max_len` was previously 1, it will now be 2. If it was greater than 2, it will remain unchanged. 

The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `substr`) are not affected. Thus, we can express the output based on the possible values of `max_len`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is the substring `s[1:3]`.**
