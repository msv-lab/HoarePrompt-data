To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the longest substring of a given string `s` that is not a palindrome. If all substrings are palindromes, the output should be `0`.

### Program Analysis
Here is the relevant portion of the code:
```python
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```

1. **Length Check**: If the string has a length of 1 or less, it correctly returns `0` since a single character is always a palindrome.
2. **Check if the whole string is a palindrome**: If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, it returns the length of the string, which is correct.
3. **Check if removing the first character results in a non-palindrome**: If the substring `s[1:]` is not a palindrome, it returns `len(s) - 1`. This is also correct because removing one character may yield a longer substring that is not a palindrome.
4. **Check if removing the last character results in a non-palindrome**: The code checks `s[:-1]` similarly, which is correct for the same reason as above.
5. **Final case**: If all checks fail, it returns `0`, indicating that all substrings are palindromes.

### Output Hints
The output hints describe that `func_1` checks if a string `s` is a palindrome and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

### Potential Edge Case
Let's consider the edge case:
- When `s` consists of the same character repeated (e.g., `"aaaaa"`). According to the problem description, all substrings of such strings are palindromes, and thus the output should be `0`. 
- The program correctly identifies that `func_1("aaaaa")` returns `True`, and none of the substrings when shortened will lead to a string that is not a palindrome.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the program and its logic against the problem description, and considering the output hints which confirm the expected behavior of `func_1`, it appears that all edge cases are handled correctly. The program checks the necessary conditions and produces the correct output as described.

Correctness: **True**
