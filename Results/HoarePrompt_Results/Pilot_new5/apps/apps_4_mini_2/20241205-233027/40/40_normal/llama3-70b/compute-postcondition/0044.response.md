`substr` is assigned the value of the substring `s[i:j]`, which means it takes the characters from index `i` to `j` in the string `s`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, `substr` will now contain the characters from index 2 up to, but not including, index 4 of `s`. The values of `n`, `max_len`, and the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `substr` is now `s[2:4]`, `max_len` is either its previous value or 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is 4.**
