Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `substr` is the first two characters of `s`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, the program maintains these variable states. There is no else part in the code.***
