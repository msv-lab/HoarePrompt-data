According to the code, the loop depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `n` is greater than 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, it will become 4. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the character at index 2 of `s` which is not equal to its reverse.**
