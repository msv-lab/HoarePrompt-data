In the given code snippet, `max_len` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_len` and the length of `substr`. The initial state specifies `max_len` is 2 and `substr` is the first three characters of `s`, meaning `len(substr)` is 3 since `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters.

1. The current value of `max_len` is 2.
2. The length of `substr` is calculated as `len(substr)`, which is 3.
3. The function `max(max_len, len(substr))` will thus compare 2 and 3, resulting in a new value for `max_len` of 3.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 50, `max_len` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the first three characters of `s`.**
