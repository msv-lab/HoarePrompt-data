Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why the function meets the problem's specifications:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads a non-empty string `s` from the input, which is in line with the problem description that specifies the input format.

2. **Finding Substrings**: The nested loops iterate through all possible substrings of `s`. For each substring, it checks whether the substring is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`). This method correctly identifies non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Calculating Maximum Length**: The variable `max_len` is updated each time a non-palindromic substring is found, ensuring that the maximum length of such substrings is captured.

4. **Output**: After examining all substrings, the function outputs `max_len` if it is greater than 0; otherwise, it outputs 0. This behavior matches the requirement to print the maximum length of a non-palindromic substring or 0 if none exists.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
   - If the input string itself is not a palindrome, it considers the entire string as the longest non-palindromic substring.
   - If all possible substrings are palindromes (e.g., "qqqqqqqq"), it correctly returns 0.

The program adheres to the problem's request to find the longest non-palindromic substring, ensuring correctness for all valid inputs as defined by the problem. Therefore, the output is deemed correct under all specified conditions.
