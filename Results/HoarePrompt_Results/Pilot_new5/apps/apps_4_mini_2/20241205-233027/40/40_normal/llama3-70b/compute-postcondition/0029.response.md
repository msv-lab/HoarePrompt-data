`substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, which means it takes the substring of `s` starting from index `i` (1) to index `j` (4). Therefore, `substr` will now contain `s[1:4]`, which is a substring of `s` that includes characters from index 1 up to (but not including) index 4. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `max_len` remain unchanged, and since `substr` is now updated, the output state reflects that.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is now `s[1:4]`.**
