According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j` which is initialized to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, the starting point of `j` (which is `i + 1`) must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, this means `j` starts at 3. 

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 3 (since `i + 1` should be less than or equal to `n + 1`, which is satisfied when `n` is at least 3). 

Thus, we need to ensure that the state reflects that `j` starts at 3, and since `n` must be greater than 2, we can keep it as is.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `substr` is the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index 2 up to index `n`.**
