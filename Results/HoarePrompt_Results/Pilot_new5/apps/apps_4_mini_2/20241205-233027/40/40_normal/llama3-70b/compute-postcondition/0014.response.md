The variable `substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`, which is `s[0:3]` since `i` is 0 and `j` is 3. This means that `substr` will take the first three characters of the string `s`. The values of `s`, `n`, `max_len`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 50, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the first three characters of `s`.**
