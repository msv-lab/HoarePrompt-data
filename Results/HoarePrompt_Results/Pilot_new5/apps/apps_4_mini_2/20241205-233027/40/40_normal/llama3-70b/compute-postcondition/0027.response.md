Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, if `substr` (which is `s[1:3]`) is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 2, while `i` remains 1, `j` stays 3, and `substr` continues to be `s[1:3]`. There is no else part in the code.***
