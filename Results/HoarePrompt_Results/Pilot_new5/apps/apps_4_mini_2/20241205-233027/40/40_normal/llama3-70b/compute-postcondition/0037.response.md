The code assigns `max_len` the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is a substring starting from index 2 of `s`, its length will be 1 (as it is a single character). Since `max_len` is initially the length of the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index 2, it must be greater than or equal to 1.

Thus, `max_len` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1. The states of the other variables are unaffected. The final value of `max_len` remains dependent on its original value compared to 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is greater than 2, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `substr` is the character at index 2 of `s` and is not equal to its reverse.**
