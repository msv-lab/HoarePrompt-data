`substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` that starts at index `i` and ends at index `j`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `substr` will be the first two characters of `s`. The values of `s`, `n`, `max_len`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is the first two characters of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is the first two characters of `s`.**
