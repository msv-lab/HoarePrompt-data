According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. Currently, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, which means the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2, since the maximum value for `i` is `n-1`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `substr` is the longest non-palindromic substring starting from index 2 up to index `n`.**
