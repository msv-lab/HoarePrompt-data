According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop runs for `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 2) up to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 3, `j` can take values 2, 3, and 4 (if `n` is exactly 3). 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 4, and `j` will continue as long as it is less than or equal to `n`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4.

Since `j` is being incremented, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 4. Therefore, the updated states should reflect this.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is still `s[1:3]`**
