Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the longest non-palindromic substring.

### Issue:
1. The function `func_1(s)` is used to check if a string is a palindrome. However, the main logic fails to account for cases where there are characters in the string that repeat but do not create palindromes.
  
2. Specifically, the program only checks if the entire string is a palindrome, and then it checks the two scenarios of removing the first or the last character. If both of these are palindromes, it incorrectly outputs `0`, even if the string has a non-palindromic substring.

### Example Case:
Consider the input `abcba`. The entire string is a palindrome, and both `bcba` and `abcb` are also palindromes. The program will output `0`, but the substring `abc` is not a palindrome and has length `3`.

Thus, the program misses the opportunity to check for all possible non-palindromic substrings effectively.

### Conclusion:
Due to this oversight in handling certain cases, the correctness of the program is false.
