Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine if it's possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that at least one garland is lit during every second after the maximum of the chosen switching times. However, the logic used in the program is incorrect.

The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals \( k1, k2, k3 \). The condition `if gcd_all == 1:` is used to determine the output. This is incorrect because having a GCD of 1 between the intervals does not guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland for every second after some time.

Consider the input `4 2 3`. The GCD of 4, 2, and 3 is 1, yet it is impossible to choose any \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) such that every second is covered because there will always be intervals of time without any lit garland. 

Therefore, the program fails to handle the logic required according to the problem description, leading to incorrect outputs in certain situations.
