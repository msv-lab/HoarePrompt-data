To assess the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, we need to evaluate how well it implements the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap
Mishka wants to ensure that there is at least one garland lit during every second after he switches them on. He has three garlands with respective intervals and needs to find suitable moments to switch them on. The output should be "YES" if it's possible to ensure that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of the switch times, otherwise "NO".

### Code Analysis
The code attempts to determine whether it's possible to light up the garlands in such a way that at least one is lit at every second after a certain point. It computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals using the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) calculated by `func_1`. The check for conditions `lcm % k1 == 0`, `lcm % k2 == 0`, and `lcm % k3 == 0` is supposed to ensure that the LCM can be evenly divided by each garland's interval.

### Potential Issues
1. The way the LCM is calculated appears suspect. The formula used for LCM:
   ```python
   lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
   ```
   This is not the correct way to compute the LCM of three numbers. The LCM should be calculated using the GCD as follows:
   ```
   lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) / gcd(a, b)
   ```
   It should be computed iteratively for three numbers. This incorrect calculation can lead to incorrect conclusions about whether there's a time at which all garlands can be lit.

2. The problem description suggests that there should be a guarantee of at least one lit garland each second after a specific time. The current logic, using LCM and GCD checks, does not ensure that every possible second is covered, especially at the transitions.

### Output Hints Review
The output hints describe the GCD function and its capabilities but do not directly address the correctness of the LCM calculation and when it can lead to a "NO" answer. Therefore, the hints do not completely align with the rigorous requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion
Given the incorrect method for calculating the LCM, there can be cases where the program will output "YES" when it should rather output "NO". For instance, when the intervals are such that they do not allow for a lit garland at every second, the program may still incorrectly compute an LCM that satisfies the divisibility conditions.

Because of the demonstrated flaw in logic and implementation, the program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
