The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is assigned the previous value of `a`, and `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Given that `b` must be greater than 0, the modulo operation is valid. The new value of `a` will be the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, and `b` will have the previous value of `a`. 

Let's denote the previous values as:
- `a` (original value)
- `b` (original value, greater than 0)
- `c` (unchanged)

After the operation:
- `a` will take the value `a % b`
- `b` will take the previous value of `a`

Thus, the Output State is: `b` takes the previous value of `a`, and `a` is now `a % b` (the remainder of the original `a` divided by `b`).

Output State: **`a` is now `a % b`, `b` is the previous value of `a`, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer**
