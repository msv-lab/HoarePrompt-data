The code assigns `gcd_all` the value of the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. Since `gcd_k1_k2` is known to be the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` will be calculated using those values.

The variables `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` remain unchanged, but `gcd_all` is now defined as `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`; `gcd_all` is equal to `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`.**
