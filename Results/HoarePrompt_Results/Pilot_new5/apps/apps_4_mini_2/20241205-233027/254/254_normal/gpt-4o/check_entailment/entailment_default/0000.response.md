The problem description requires us to determine if it is possible to choose three integers \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \), and \( x_3 \) such that at least one of the three garlands is lit at every second after the maximum of these three integers. The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) and checks if it is equal to 1 (indicating that they are coprime). If they are coprime, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Initially, the approach seems reasonable because if \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) are coprime, it implies that there exist integers \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \), and \( x_3 \) such that the intervals would cover every second after a certain point.

However, letâ€™s consider the edge cases and the output hints.

### Potential Issues:
1. If \( k_1 = 4 \), \( k_2 = 2 \), and \( k_3 = 3 \), the GCD will be 1, and the program will output "YES". However, if we analyze the intervals:
   - The garland with interval 2 will cover seconds 2, 4, 6, 8, ... (always even).
   - The garland with interval 4 will cover 4, 8, 12, ... (always multiples of 4).
   - The garland with interval 3 will cover 3, 6, 9, ... (multiples of 3).
   
   Notably, the seconds 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, etc., will not be lit at all. Thus, the output "YES" is incorrect.

2. If we take \( k_1 = 1 \), \( k_2 = 1 \), and \( k_3 = 1 \), the program will correctly output "YES" since they are coprime, but it doesn't validate the necessary coverage properly as it could lead to incorrect conclusions in more complex cases.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints state that the function checks the GCD of the inputs and responds based on whether they are coprime. However, the conclusion drawn from just checking the GCD does not ensure that all seconds will be covered.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the edge cases correctly, particularly when the GCD is 1 but the intervals do not overlap properly to ensure lighting at every second after the maximum. 

Therefore, the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
