According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the previous value of `a`, and it's given that `b` must be greater than 0. Since `b` is already established as greater than 0, it allows the loop to execute one more time without any adjustments to the state.

State: **`a` is now `a % b`, `b` is the previous value of `a`, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer**
