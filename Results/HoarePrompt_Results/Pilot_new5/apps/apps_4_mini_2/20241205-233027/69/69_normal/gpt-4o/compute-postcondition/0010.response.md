The value of `final_x` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `final_x` is 0, so after the operation, `final_x` will be -1. The other variables retain their previous values, and the constraints on `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `op` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, `final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0, and the character `op` is 'L'.**
