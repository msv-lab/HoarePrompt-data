The variable `final_x` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9, and `final_x` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0**.
