The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. Here are the details of each parameter:

- `n` is a positive integer with a value between 1 and 200,000.
- `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
- `x` and `y` are integers that can range from -10^9 to 10^9.

After executing the function body, there are two cases for the return value:

- Case 1: The function returns 0, which is explicitly stated in the return statement.
- Case 2: If a variable `min_length` is not equal to infinity, the function returns `min_length`, indicating the minimum length of all found paths that return to the target position; otherwise, it returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a string of operations, and two integers `x` and `y`, and return either 0, the minimum length of paths that return to a target position, or -1 if no valid paths are found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), operations (a string of length n of 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'), and x and y (integers). It returns 0, or the minimum length of valid paths returning to the target position, or -1 if no valid paths exist.**
