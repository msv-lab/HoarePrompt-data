The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a string of operations consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net horizontal and vertical movements based on the operations. If the net movements required to reach (x, y) from the origin exceed the movements provided, it prints -1. Otherwise, it counts how many operations did not result in any net movement towards the target coordinates and prints this count. If `n` is 0 (though not allowed per specified constraints), the function would not handle this case properly but would effectively return no usable result since the loop wouldn't execute.
