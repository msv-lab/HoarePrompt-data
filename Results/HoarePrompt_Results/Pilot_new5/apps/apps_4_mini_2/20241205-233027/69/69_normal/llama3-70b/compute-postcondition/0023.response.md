`ux` is incremented by 1. The values of `uy`, `operations`, `ops`, and their respective conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string where `op` is the second character in the string, `uy` is unchanged, `ux` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string where `op` is the second character in the string, `uy` is unchanged, `ux` is increased by 1.**
