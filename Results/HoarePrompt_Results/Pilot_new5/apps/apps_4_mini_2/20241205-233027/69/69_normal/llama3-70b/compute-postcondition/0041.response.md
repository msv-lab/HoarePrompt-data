The code snippet `print(-1)` does not modify any variables or states; it merely outputs the value `-1`. The conditions regarding `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged, as do the values of `operations`, `ux`, `uy`, `x`, `y`, `lx`, and `ly`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values alongside the message that `-1` has been returned.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ux` is the net horizontal movement based on the number of 'R' minus the number of 'L'; `uy` is the net vertical movement based on the number of 'U' minus the number of 'D'; `dx` is equal to `x - ux`; `dy` is equal to `y - uy`; `x` and `y` remain unchanged; `lx` and `ly` remain unchanged; `-1` has been returned.**
