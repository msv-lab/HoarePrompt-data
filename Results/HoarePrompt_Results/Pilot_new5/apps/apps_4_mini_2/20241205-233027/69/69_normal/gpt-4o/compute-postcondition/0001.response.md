The variable `final_y` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `final_y` was not defined, but it is now updated to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, and `final_y` is 0.
