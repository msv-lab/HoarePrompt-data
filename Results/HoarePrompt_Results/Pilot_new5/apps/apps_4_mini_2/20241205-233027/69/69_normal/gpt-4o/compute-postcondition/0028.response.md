The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 199999), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, and `final_y` is increased by 1.
