Output State: **`final_x` is the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; at least one of `dx` or `dy` is non-zero; `min_length` remains unchanged; `position_map` is updated with the entry `(current_x, current_y): i`; `n` is greater than `k + 1`; and `i` is now `k + 1`; `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`.**
