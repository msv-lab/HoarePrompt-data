To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given information. The loop iterates over the string `ops`, which consists of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'. The key points to consider are:

1. The loop is dependent on the length of `ops`. If `ops` is an empty string (length 0), the loop will not execute.
2. The variable `op` will represent each character in the `ops` string during each iteration.
3. The states of `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, but they may change during the loop's execution.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, we can deduce that `ops` should also have a meaningful length for the loop to run at least once. 

To ensure the loop executes, we must ensure that `ops` is not empty. Additionally, we need to indicate the initial state of `op` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string; `op` is the first character in `ops`, and the initial values of `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly` are as given.**
