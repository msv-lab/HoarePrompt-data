The value of `final_y` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unaffected, and since there are no specific values provided for `final_y`, it is considered to be modified without further specification. The output state retains the definitions of the other variables but updates `final_y`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 199999), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, `final_y` is decreased by 1.**
