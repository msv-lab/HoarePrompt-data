Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 2. If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1, while `dx` remains unchanged, and `res` may remain unchanged or be incremented by 1 depending on the operation. Otherwise, if `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is incremented by 1, `dx` remains unchanged, and `res` may remain unchanged or be incremented by 1 depending on the operation. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1, and `res` may remain unchanged or be incremented by 1 depending on the operation. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is incremented by 1, and `res` may remain unchanged or be incremented by 1 depending on the operation. In all other cases, `dx` remains unchanged, and `res` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `dy` remains unchanged throughout.***
