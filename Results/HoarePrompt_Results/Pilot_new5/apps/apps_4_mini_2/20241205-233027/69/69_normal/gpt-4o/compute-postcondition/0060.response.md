Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L', `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`, either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, `min_length` is set to positive infinity, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` is -1. If `operations[i]` is 'L', then `current_x` is -1 and `current_y` is 0. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is 1 and `current_y` is 0.***
