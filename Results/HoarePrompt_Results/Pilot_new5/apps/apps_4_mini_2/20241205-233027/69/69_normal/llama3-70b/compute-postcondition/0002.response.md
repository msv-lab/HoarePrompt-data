The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided through `input().split()`, which splits the input string into two parts and maps them to integers. The previous values of `x` and `y` are not known as they will be updated with the new input values. The values of `operations`, `n`, and `ops` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `n` is an input positive integer; `ops` is an input string; `x` and `y` are now assigned new input integer values from the input.**
