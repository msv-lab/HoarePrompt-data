Postcondition: ***`final_x` is the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; at least one of `dx` or `dy` is non-zero; `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is found in `position_map`; `position_map` is updated with the entry `(current_x, current_y): 0`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`; if `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` is decreased by 1; otherwise, if `operations[i]` is 'L', `current_x` is decremented by 1; or if `operations[i]` is 'R', `current_x` is incremented by 1.***
