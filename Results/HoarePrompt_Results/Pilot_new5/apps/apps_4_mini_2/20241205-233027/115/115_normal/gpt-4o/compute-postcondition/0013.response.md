The code assigns the value `1` to four elements in a 2D list `B` based on the indices `i`, `j`, `i + 1`, and `j + 1`. The preconditions state that `n` is at least `2`, `m` is between `2` and `50`, `i` is `0`, and `j` must be less than `m - 1`. The values of the array `B` are modified, but the precondition and values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` must be less than `m - 1, B[i][j] = 1, B[i][j + 1] = 1, B[i + 1][j] = 1, B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1**
