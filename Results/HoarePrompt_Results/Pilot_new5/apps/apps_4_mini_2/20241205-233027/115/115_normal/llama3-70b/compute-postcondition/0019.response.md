The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the tuple becomes `(0 + 1, 2 + 1)`, which evaluates to `(1, 3)`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged as no actions were performed on them. 

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `ops` now includes the tuple (1, 3)**.
