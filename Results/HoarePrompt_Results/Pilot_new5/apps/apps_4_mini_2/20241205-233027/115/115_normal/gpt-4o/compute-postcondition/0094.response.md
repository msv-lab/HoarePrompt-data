The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `m` (an integer), and `A` (a 2D list of integers consisting of 0s and 1s, with dimensions `n x m`). The function checks for 2x2 submatrices within `A`, which consist entirely of 1s. For each valid 2x2 submatrix found, the corresponding positions in a new matrix `B` are set to 1, and their indices are recorded in a list called `operations`. After processing all possible 2x2 submatrices, the function verifies whether the original matrix `A` is identical to the matrix `B`. If there is any discrepancy between `A` and `B`, the function returns -1, indicating an error. 

The function also prints the number of valid operations found and their corresponding indices. However, the function does not return any information about the found operations or the final state of the matrices, aside from the return value of -1 in the case of mismatches. Therefore, while the function performs the intended checks and operations, it lacks a return value that indicates successful execution or details about the operations performed. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A` of integers, checks for 2x2 submatrices of 1s in `A`, sets corresponding elements in a new matrix `B`, and returns -1 if `A` and `B` do not match. The function prints the count of valid operations and their indices but does not provide any return value indicating success or the operations performed if there are no mismatches. **
