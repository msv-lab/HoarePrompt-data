The provided program attempts to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to transform matrix B (initially filled with zeros) into matrix A using the allowed operations (filling 2x2 submatrices with ones). 

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions of the matrix (n, m) and then constructs the matrix A from input. This step is correctly implemented.

2. **Operation Logic**: The nested loops iterate over each possible top-left corner of a 2x2 submatrix in A. The checks inside the loop are as follows:
   - If all four elements of the current 2x2 submatrix in A are 1, it does nothing and moves on to the next position. 
   - If at least one of the four elements is 1, it records the position (i+1, j+1) for an operation.
   - However, this logic fails for cases where it is impossible to achieve the required configuration in B. The program does not check if filling the recorded positions would actually allow for A to be correctly formed.

3. **Output**: After checking all possible positions, the program checks if the number of recorded operations exceeds 2500 and prints -1 if so. Otherwise, it outputs the count of operations and their respective coordinates.

**Correctness Evaluation**:
- The program does not ensure that all necessary 1s in A can be created with the recorded operations. For example, if A has a single 1 that cannot be part of any 2x2 operation (e.g., isolated 1s without adjacent 1s to form a 2x2), the program may still output an operation for positions that do not lead to a valid transformation of B into A.
- The logic for determining the positions where operations can be executed does not guarantee that those operations would suffice to make B equal to A. In cases where isolated 1s exist in A, the output will incorrectly suggest the ability to achieve matrix equality.

**Counterexample**:
Consider the case:
```
A = [[1, 0],
     [0, 0]]
```
In this case, the program will look at the only 2x2 matrix (which is just the first two elements), and when it sees that not all are 1s, it records a position but cannot actually turn B into A, as B cannot create the isolated 1 in the upper left corner alone.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
