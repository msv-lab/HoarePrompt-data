Postcondition: ***`B` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions n x m, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` must be greater than 1, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there are no changes made, and the program proceeds without returning any value.***
