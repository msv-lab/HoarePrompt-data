Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` has `B[1][j] = 1`, `B[1][j + 1] = 1`, `B[2][j] = 1`, `B[2][j + 1] = 1`, and `j` is at least 0 and less than `m - 2`, if `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `operations` has an additional value (2, j + 1) appended.***
