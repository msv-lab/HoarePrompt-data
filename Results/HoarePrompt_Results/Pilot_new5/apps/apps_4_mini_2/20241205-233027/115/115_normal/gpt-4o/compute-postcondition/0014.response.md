The `operations` list is updated by appending a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. The value of `i` is `0`, and `j` is less than `m - 1`, which implies that `j` can take on an integer value from `0` to `m - 2`. The specific value of `j` is not given, but it must be valid within the range defined. Therefore, the appended tuple will be `(1, j + 1)`, where `j + 1` is in the range from `1` to `m - 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` must be less than `m - 1, operations` includes `(1, j + 1)` where `j + 1` is in the range from `1` to `m - 1.**
