According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. For the loop to continue executing, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 1**
