The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `ops` list. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 0 in the initial state, the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` will both equal 1. Therefore, the tuple `(1, 1)` will be added to the `ops` list.

The other variables remain unchanged in value, so they stay as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` is now [(1, 1)], and `j` is 0.**
