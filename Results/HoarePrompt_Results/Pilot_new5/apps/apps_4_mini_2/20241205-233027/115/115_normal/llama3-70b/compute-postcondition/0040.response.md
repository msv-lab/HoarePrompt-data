Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples indicating positions of elements in `A` that are equal to 1, and `j` is now `m - 1`. After all iterations, `ops` will contain tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `j` where at least one of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, while no duplicates are present. If there are no such elements for all `j` values, `ops` will remain unchanged.**
