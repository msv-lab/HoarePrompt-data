Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` must be 1. If all four values `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, the function proceeds with the specified logic for this case. If not, no action is taken, and the state of `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remains unchanged.***
