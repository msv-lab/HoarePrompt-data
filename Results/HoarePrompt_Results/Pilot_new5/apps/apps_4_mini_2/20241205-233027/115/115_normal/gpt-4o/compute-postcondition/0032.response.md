According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 3. 

To determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time: 
- The next value of `i` will be 2 (since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration).
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Thus, if `i` is to be 2, then `n` must be at least 4 (because `n - 1` must be greater than 2).

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where all corresponding 2x2 submatrices set to 1 based on the conditions of `A` have been processed, and `operations` contains tuples of the form `(2, j + 1)` for each valid 2x2 submatrix found in `A` that meets the specified conditions.**
