Postcondition: ***`B` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions n x m, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is `m`, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1; otherwise, nothing is returned.***
