According to the code, the loop iterates over the `ops` list. For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple since the loop body will not run if `ops` is empty. Given that the state specifies that `ops` contains tuples indicating unique positions in `A`, it suggests that `ops` should have at least one valid position.

Since the current state specifies that the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500, we must ensure that it is greater than 0 for the loop to be executed. Therefore, the necessary adjustments include stating that `ops` must not be empty and indicating that `op` will be the first element in `ops`.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` must have at least 1 tuple, `op` is the first tuple in `ops`**
