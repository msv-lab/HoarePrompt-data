The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is currently `m - 1`, the tuple added to `ops` will be `(3, m)` where `m` is greater than or equal to 2. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(3, m)`, and `j` is now `m - 1`.**
