According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 3, and `m` must still satisfy the condition that it is greater than or equal to 3.

Since `j` is currently 2, it can be incremented to 3, which is still less than or equal to `m - 1` when `m` is at least 4. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` becomes 3.
- `m` remains greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `ops` contains the additional tuple `(3, m + 1)`, `j` is 3**
