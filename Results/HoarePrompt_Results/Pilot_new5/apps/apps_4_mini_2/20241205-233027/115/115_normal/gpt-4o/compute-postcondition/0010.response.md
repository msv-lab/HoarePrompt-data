The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i` and `j` are as follows: `i` is 0 and `j` was previously updated to `j + 1`. Thus, `j` has a specific value now. 

After executing the code, the new tuple added to `operations` will be `(0 + 1, j + 1)`, which simplifies to `(1, j + 1)`. The value of `operations` is updated to include this new entry.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will include the modified state of `operations`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `B[i][j] = 1`, `B[i][j + 1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `operations` now includes the tuple `(1, j + 1)`**
