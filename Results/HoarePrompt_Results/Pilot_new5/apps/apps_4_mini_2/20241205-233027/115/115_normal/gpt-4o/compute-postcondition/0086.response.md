According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `operations` variable. For the loop to execute at least once, the `operations` list must contain at least one element. The variables `B` and `A` being 2D lists of integers do not influence the ability of the loop to run, as they are equal to each other and their contents are not relevant to the loop's execution.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can be executed, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `operations` must not be empty. The loop variable `op` should also be set to the first operation in the list when the loop starts.

State: **`B` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions n x m, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions n x m, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `operations` must not be empty, `op` is the first operation in the list**.
