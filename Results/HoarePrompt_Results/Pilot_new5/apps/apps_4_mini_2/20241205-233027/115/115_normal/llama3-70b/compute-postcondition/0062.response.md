The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` but does not change any values of the existing variables. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged except for the output being printed.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples indicating all unique positions `(i + 1, j + 1)` in `A` for which at least one of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, ensuring no duplicates in `ops`, and the current length of `ops` is greater than 2500; -1 has been printed.**
