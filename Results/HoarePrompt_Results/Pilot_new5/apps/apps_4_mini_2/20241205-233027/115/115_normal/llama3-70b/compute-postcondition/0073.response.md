The function `func` accepts a parameter `A`, which is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s. Additionally, it accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, which are integers with the constraints that both `n` and `m` lie between 2 and 50, inclusive. After executing the function, the output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, I cannot accurately describe the specific return value based solely on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list A of integers (containing only 0s and 1s) and two integers n and m (where 2 <= n, m <= 50). The exact output of the function is not specified.**
