The code updates the values in the 2D list `B` at the specified indices. Specifically, the elements `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1. The initial state provided indicates that the values in `A` at those positions are 1, but the values in `B` were initially all 0. 

After executing the code, the corresponding entries in `B` are updated to 1.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a 2D list of integers (1) with dimensions n x m where `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[1][0]`, and `B[1][1]` are all 1, `j` is 0.**
