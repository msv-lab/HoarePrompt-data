Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` is an empty list, and `j` is 0. If the elements at positions `A[0][0]`, `A[1][0]`, `A[0][1]`, and `A[1][1]` are all equal to 1, then the specific condition is satisfied.***
