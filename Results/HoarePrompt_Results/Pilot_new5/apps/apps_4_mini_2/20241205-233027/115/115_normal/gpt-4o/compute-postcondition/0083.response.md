Output State: **`B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `m` is greater than 0. For all `j` in range(m), `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`. If any `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function would return -1, indicating a mismatch; otherwise, there is no return value (None).**
