Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where all corresponding 2x2 submatrices set to 1 based on the conditions of `A` have been processed, and `operations` contains tuples of the form `(2, j + 1)` for each valid 2x2 submatrix found in `A` that meets the specified conditions.**
