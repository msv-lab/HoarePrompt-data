Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 1. If at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `ops` contains the tuple (1, 2), and the loop iteration continues.***
