According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `j` must iterate over a range defined by `m - 1`, which means `m` must be greater than 1. Since it is given that `m` is between 2 and 50, this condition is satisfied.

At the start of the loop, `j` will begin at 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, to ensure the loop runs correctly, we need to establish that `j` starts at 0.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions n x m, `operations` includes tuples of the form `(1, j + 1)` for valid 2x2 submatrices found in `A`, `j` is 0**
