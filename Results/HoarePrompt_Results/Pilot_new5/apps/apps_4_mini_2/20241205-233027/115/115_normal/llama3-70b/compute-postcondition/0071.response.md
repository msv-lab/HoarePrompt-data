Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` must contain tuples indicating positions in `A`, `op` will have the last tuple in `ops`, and the output will consist of the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`. The final output is the integer value `len(ops)`, which represents the total number of tuples in `ops`.**
