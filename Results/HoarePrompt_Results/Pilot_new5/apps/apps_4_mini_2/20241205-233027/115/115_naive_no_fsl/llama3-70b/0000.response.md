Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to transform matrix `B` into matrix `A`. Specifically, it fails to consider the situation where certain patterns in `A` cannot be formed using the allowed operations.

### Example of failure:

Consider the following input for `A`:

```
2 2
1 0
1 1
```

In this case, the matrix `A` is:
```
1 0
1 1
```

The program will attempt to iterate through the matrix and find positions where it can perform operations. However, it will miss the fact that the top-left element `A[0][0]` is `1` while `A[0][1]` is `0`. The program will add the operation `(1, 1)` since `A[1][0]` and `A[1][1]` are both `1`, without properly handling the fact that a `2x2` operation cannot cover the `0` in `A[0][1]`.

Thus, it would suggest a valid operation to achieve the incorrect state, while, in reality, it is impossible to create the matrix `A` from `B` using the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
The program fails in cases where the `1`s are not contiguous in a `2x2` shape, leading to incorrect and incomplete operations, which means it does not meet the requirements as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
