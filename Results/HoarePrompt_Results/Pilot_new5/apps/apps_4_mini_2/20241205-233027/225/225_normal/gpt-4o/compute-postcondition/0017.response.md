The value of `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the distance from the last vowel position (`prev_pos`) to the end of the string (`len(s)`). We know `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is a fixed set, and `prev_pos` indicates the last found vowel's index. The value of `max_jump` is adjusted based on these values.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is updated to max(`max_jump`, len(`s`) - `prev_pos`), `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`, and `i` is equal to the length of `s` after all iterations of the loop.**
