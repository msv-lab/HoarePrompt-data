The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(s)`, which calculates the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters of length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`.**
