The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of the expression `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Given that `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, we can infer that there is at least one non-vowel character after the last vowel in the string `s`. Thus, the calculation for the new value of `max_jump` will reflect this distance.

After the expression is evaluated, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`, and `max_jump` is updated according to the expression.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1), `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`**
