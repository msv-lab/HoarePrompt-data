The value of `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the difference between `i` and `prev_pos`. Given the initial state, `prev_pos` is -1 and `i` is 0, so the expression `i - prev_pos` evaluates to `0 - (-1) = 1`. Therefore, `max_jump` is updated to `max(1, 1)`, which remains 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
