The statement `prev_pos = i` assigns the value of `i` to `prev_pos`. The value of `prev_pos` will now be equal to the current value of `i`, which is contingent on whether `s[2]` is a vowel. Since `i` is defined as `2` if `s[2]` is a vowel, then `prev_pos` will also be set to `2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions and the assignment made in the code, we can now structure the output state.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 2, `i` is 2 if `s[2]` is a vowel, and `len(s)` must be at least 3.**
