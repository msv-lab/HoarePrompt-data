The variable `vowels` is assigned the string 'AEIOUY', which is a constant string of capital English letters representing the vowels. The state of the other variable `s` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `s` while updating the new value of `vowels`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters of length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'**
