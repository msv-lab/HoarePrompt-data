Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, if `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, while `last_vowel` remains the index of the last vowel found in `s`.***
