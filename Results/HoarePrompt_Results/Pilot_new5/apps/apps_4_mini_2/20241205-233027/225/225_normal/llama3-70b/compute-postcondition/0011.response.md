Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is a vowel. If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `last_vowel` is not -1, `max_jump` is updated to the value of max(0, (0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1).***
