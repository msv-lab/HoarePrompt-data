Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `last_vowel` is 0 if `s[i]` is a vowel; if `last_vowel` is 0, then `max_jump` is set to 1. Otherwise, `last_vowel` remains -1 and `max_jump` is unchanged.***
