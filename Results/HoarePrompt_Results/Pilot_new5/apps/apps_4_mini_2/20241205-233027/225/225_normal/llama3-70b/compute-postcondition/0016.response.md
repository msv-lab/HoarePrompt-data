To analyze the provided code snippet:

- `max_jump` is updated based on the maximum value between its current value and the result of the expression `((i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`.
- Given that `i` is initialized to 1, we need to calculate the value of `i - last_vowel`. 
- The value of `last_vowel` is dependent on `s[1]`. If `s[1]` is a vowel (i.e., one of 'AEIOUY'), then `last_vowel` is 0; otherwise, it is -1.

Thus, we can evaluate both scenarios for `last_vowel`:

1. If `s[1]` is a vowel:
   - `last_vowel` = 0
   - `i - last_vowel` = 1 - 0 = 1
   - The expression becomes `(1 // 2) + 1` = 0 + 1 = 1.

2. If `s[1]` is not a vowel:
   - `last_vowel` = -1
   - `i - last_vowel` = 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2
   - The expression becomes `(2 // 2) + 1` = 1 + 1 = 2.

Since `max_jump` is unchanged initially, it will either stay the same or be updated to either 1 or 2, depending on whether `s[1]` is a vowel.

Now, we present the output state:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 0 if `s[1]` is a vowel, otherwise `last_vowel` is -1; `max_jump` is either unchanged, 1 (if `last_vowel` is 0) or 2 (if `last_vowel` is -1).**
