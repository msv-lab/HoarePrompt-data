The variable `last_vowel` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `last_vowel` will now be equal to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `last_vowel` is 0, and if `last_vowel` is 0, then `max_jump` is set to 1.**
