According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is indexed over the range of the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, its length will be at least 1, allowing the loop to execute at least once. The `prev_pos` is initialized to -1, which may be relevant within the loop's body but does not affect the ability of the loop to start executing.

At the start of the loop, `i` will take on values starting from 0 up to `len(s) - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
