According to the code, the for loop will execute once for each index in the string `s`, which has a length of `len(s)`. The variable `i` starts at 1 at the end of the last iteration. Given that the loop iterates over the indices of the string `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be updated to 2. Also, the condition for the loop is that `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Therefore, `len(s)` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to execute again when `i` is 2.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is updated to 1, and `i` is 2 if the character at position `i` in string `s` is a vowel, and `len(s)` must be at least 3**
