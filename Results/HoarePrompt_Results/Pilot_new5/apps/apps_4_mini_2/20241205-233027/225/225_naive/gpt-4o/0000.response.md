To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

1. The function initializes a set of vowels `{'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}` which is correct as per the problem statement.
2. It keeps track of the maximum jump needed (`max_jump`) and the previous position where a vowel was found (`prev_pos`), initializing `prev_pos` to -1 (indicating the starting point before the first character).
3. The program iterates through each character of the input string `s`:
   - If the current character is a vowel, it calculates the distance from the previous vowel position to the current position and updates `max_jump` if the calculated distance is greater.
   - It then updates `prev_pos` to the current position.
4. After exiting the loop, the program checks if the jump from the last vowel found to the end of the string is greater than the current `max_jump` and updates it accordingly.
5. Finally, it returns `max_jump`.

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Case with no vowels**: If the input string contains no vowels, for example, "BCDFG", the Grasshopper cannot make any jumps, and the expected output should be equal to the length of the string plus one (5 + 1 = 6, since he has to jump over the entire string). However, the current logic would return a `max_jump` of 1 because `prev_pos` would remain -1, and `max_jump` would only consider the distance to the end from -1, which is 7.

2. **Case with one vowel**: For the string "A", the expected output is 1, which the current function handles correctly.

3. **Case with consecutive vowels**: For the string "AAA", the expected output is also correctly determined as 1.

4. **Case with vowels only at the start and end**: For the string "AABBBBA", it should correctly return 5, which it does as expected.

Given the analysis, the program fails to handle the case where there are no vowels in the string. Thus, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case where the string has no vowels correctly. For example, the input "BCDFG" does not yield the expected output of 6, as it would incorrectly return 1 instead.
