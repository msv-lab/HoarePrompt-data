n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500); m is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)); edges is a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.
