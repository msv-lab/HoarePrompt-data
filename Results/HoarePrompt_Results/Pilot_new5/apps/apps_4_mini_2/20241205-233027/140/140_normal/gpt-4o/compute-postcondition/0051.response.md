The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds `neighbor` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Given the initial conditions, since `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1 and is currently equal to 0, it is valid to append `neighbor` to the `queue`. 

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `count` is increased by 1; `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, `queue` now contains `neighbor`, `node` corresponds to a vertex in `graph` that has at least 1 neighbor.**
