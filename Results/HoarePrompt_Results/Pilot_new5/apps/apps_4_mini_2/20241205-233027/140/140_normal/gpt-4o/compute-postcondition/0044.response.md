Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, except for all `in_degree[neighbor]` that were processed during the loop. The `queue` contains all neighbors of the processed nodes that have zero incoming edges after the loop execution, and `count` reflects the total number of nodes added to the queue. If the queue was initially empty, the loop does not execute and `in_degree[v]` remains unchanged, `queue` is empty, and `count` is 0.**
