The code snippet `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. The initial state specifies that `in_degree[v]` is equal to its previous value plus 1, meaning that after the execution of this code, the value of `in_degree[v]` will increase by one from its previous state.

Since `v` is identified as the third vertex in `graph[u]`, we can say that `in_degree[v]` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 1 vertex, `u` is the first vertex in `graph`, `graph[u]` must contain at least 3 vertices, `in_degree[v]` is equal to its previous value + 1 (after the increment).**
