You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500); m is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)); edges is a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples representing directed edges, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each vertex u has a list of vertices v that it points to, and `graph` contains all edges from the list `edges`.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES', indicating a valid condition in the directed graph represented by 'graph' without cycles.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples representing directed edges, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each vertex u has a list of vertices v that it points to, and `graph` contains all edges from the list `edges`. The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples containing all edges, `graph` contains all edges from `edges`, and the graph contains at least one cycle.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO' indicating a specific condition about the graph with at least one cycle

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from each vertex. n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`; `graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from each vertex; `u` is each vertex in `graph` during the iteration.

    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `in_degree[v]` for all vertices `v` in `graph` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` after processing all nodes in `queue`; `queue` is empty, indicating all nodes with zero in-degrees have been processed, and `count` is equal to the total number of nodes in the graph that had zero incoming edges initially, plus any additional nodes that had their in-degree reduced to zero during the loop execution. If `queue` was initially empty, then `in_degree[v]` remains unchanged, `queue` is empty, and `count` is 0.
    return count != n
    #The program returns True if the total number of nodes processed (count) is not equal to the total number of nodes in the graph (n)


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
