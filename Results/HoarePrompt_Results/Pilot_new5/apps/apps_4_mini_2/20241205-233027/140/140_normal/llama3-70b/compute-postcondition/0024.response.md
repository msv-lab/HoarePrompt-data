Output State: **`node` is an integer, `graph` has been fully traversed, `visited` indicates all nodes reachable from the original `node`, `rec_stack` reflects whether a cycle was detected along any path from the original `node`. If all reachable nodes were visited without detecting a cycle, then `rec_stack` for those nodes will be False. If at least one cycle was detected during the traversal, then `rec_stack` for at least one of those nodes will be True.**
