Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer with at least one unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `neighbor` has not been visited, then if `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, it indicates the current node has at least one unvisited neighbor. Otherwise, there is no additional action taken. If `neighbor` has been visited but `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating that a cycle has been detected. In the absence of further conditions, the program continues execution without returning a value.***
