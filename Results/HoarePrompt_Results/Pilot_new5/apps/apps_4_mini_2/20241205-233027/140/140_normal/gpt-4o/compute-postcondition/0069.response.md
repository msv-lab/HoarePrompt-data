Postcondition: ***`in_degree[v]` is defined for all vertices `v` in `graph`, `queue` now contains `neighbor` added to it, `count` is increased by 1, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must have at least 1 neighbor, and `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `in_degree[neighbor]` is also 0 after the operation.***
