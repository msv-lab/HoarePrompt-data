The variable `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. Since it is stated that `in_degree[neighbor]` must be greater than or equal to 0, it will still remain non-negative after the operation. The values of `count`, `queue`, and `node` do not change with this operation. 

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is greater than or equal to 0 and now equals `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`; `count` is increased by 1; `queue` contains at least one neighbor; `node` corresponds to a vertex in `graph` that still has remaining neighbors.**
