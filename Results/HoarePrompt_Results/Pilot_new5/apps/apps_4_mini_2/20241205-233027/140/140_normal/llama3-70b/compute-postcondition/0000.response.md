The code assigns `True` to `visited[node]`, indicating that the vertex represented by `node` has been marked as visited. The other variables `graph` and `rec_stack` remain unaffected in terms of their values. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the directed graph, `graph` is a list of lists where each list contains the vertices connected by directed edges, `visited` has `visited[node]` set to True, `rec_stack` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each vertex is in the current recursion stack.**
