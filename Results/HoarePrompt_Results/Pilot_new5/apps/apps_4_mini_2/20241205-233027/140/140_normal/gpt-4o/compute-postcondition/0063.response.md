Output State: **`in_degree[v]` for all vertices `v` in `graph` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v`; `queue` must contain at least one neighbor of `node`; `count` is the total number of neighbors processed from `node`; `node` is now the vertex that was removed from `queue`.**
