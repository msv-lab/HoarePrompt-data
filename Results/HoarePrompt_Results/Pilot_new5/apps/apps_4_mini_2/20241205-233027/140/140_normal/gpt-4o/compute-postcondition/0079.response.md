Output State: **`in_degree[v]` for all vertices `v` in `graph` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` after processing all nodes in `queue`; `queue` is empty, indicating all nodes with zero in-degrees have been processed, and `count` is equal to the total number of nodes in the graph that had zero incoming edges initially, plus any additional nodes that had their in-degree reduced to zero during the loop execution. If `queue` was initially empty, then `in_degree[v]` remains unchanged, `queue` is empty, and `count` is 0.**
