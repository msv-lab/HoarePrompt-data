n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the directed graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and each edge is represented by a pair of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, with each pair listed at most once.
