According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the neighbors of the `node` in the `graph`. Since the loop iterates over `graph[node]`, it will execute once for each neighbor of `node`. At the end of the last iteration, `node` is an integer and has at least one neighbor in `graph[node]`. This means the loop has executed for at least one neighbor already.

To execute one more time, we assume that there are still unprocessed neighbors in `graph[node]`. If there was only one neighbor initially and it has been processed, there wouldn't be any neighbors left for the loop to continue. Therefore, to enable the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more neighbor that has not been processed.

Thus, if `node` has at least one neighbor left to iterate over, the loop will execute again, where the next `neighbor` will be the subsequent neighbor in `graph[node]`.

State: **`node` is an integer, `graph` has at least one unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`, `visited[node]` is True, and `rec_stack[node]` is True.**
