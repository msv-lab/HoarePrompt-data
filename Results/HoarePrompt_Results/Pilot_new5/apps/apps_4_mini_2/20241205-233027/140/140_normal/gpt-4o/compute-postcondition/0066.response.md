The code decreases the in-degree of a specific neighbor of the node. The `in_degree` variable associated with the `neighbor` vertex is reduced by 1, affecting only the value of `in_degree[neighbor]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is defined for all vertices `v` in `graph`, `queue` contains at least one neighbor of `node`, `count` is increased by 1, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must have at least 1 neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1**.
