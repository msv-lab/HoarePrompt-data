According to the code, the loop iterates over each vertex in the `graph`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 3 vertices in the `graph`. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is the second vertex in the graph, indicating that the first iteration processed the first vertex. To prepare for the next iteration, `u` should be updated to the third vertex of the graph. Thus, `graph` must have at least 3 vertices for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`graph` must have at least 3 vertices, `u` is the third vertex in `graph`, `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` plus the number of vertices in `graph[u]`, where `v` represents each vertex in `graph[u]`.**
