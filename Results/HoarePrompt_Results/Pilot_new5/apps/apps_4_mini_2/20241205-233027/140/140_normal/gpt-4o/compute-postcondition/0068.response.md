The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds `neighbor` to the `queue`. Since `queue` originally contains at least one neighbor of `node`, and `neighbor` is a valid neighbor whose `in_degree` has just been decreased to 0, the impact of this operation will be that `neighbor` is now part of the `queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is defined for all vertices `v` in `graph`, `queue` now contains `neighbor` added to it, `count` is increased by 1, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must have at least 1 neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.**
