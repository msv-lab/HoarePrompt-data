`to_remove` is assigned the value of 0. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `count_zeros`) are not affected and remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is 0; `to_remove` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is 0; `to_remove` is 0.**
