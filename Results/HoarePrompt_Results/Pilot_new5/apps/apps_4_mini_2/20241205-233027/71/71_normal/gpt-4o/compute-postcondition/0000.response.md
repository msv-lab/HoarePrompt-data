`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()` and then converted to strings using `map(str, ...)`. Since `n` was initially a non-negative integer and `k` was a positive integer, after this assignment, `n` and `k` will now hold string representations of the input values. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000; `k` is a string representation of a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 9.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000; `k` is a string representation of a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 9.**
