Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (up to 2,000,000,000) and a positive integer `k` (1 to 9). It counts the number of trailing zeros in `n`. If exactly `k` zeros are found, it prints the number of non-zero digits before the zeros. If fewer than `k` zeros are found, it prints the length of `n` minus one. If `n` has no digits, it will still handle printing based on the checks performed.**
