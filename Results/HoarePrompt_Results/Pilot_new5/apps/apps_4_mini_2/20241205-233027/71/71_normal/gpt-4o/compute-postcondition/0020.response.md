The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `to_remove`, and `digit`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `count_zeros`, while maintaining the states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty; `count_zeros` is `k + 1`; `to_remove` retains its value; `digit` is the next digit in the reversed string of `n`.**
