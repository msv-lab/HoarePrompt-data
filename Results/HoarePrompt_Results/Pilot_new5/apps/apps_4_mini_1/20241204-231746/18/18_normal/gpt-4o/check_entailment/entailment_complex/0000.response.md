To determine if the provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement regarding the Mexican wave, let's analyze the conditions and the expected output based on the input values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Standing Spectators**:
   - From time `1` to `k`: The number of standing spectators increases from `1` to `k`.
   - From time `k + 1` to `n`: The number of standing spectators stabilizes at `k`.
   - From time `n + 1` to `n + k`: The number of standing spectators decreases from `k` to `0`.

### Expected Outputs Based on Time `t`:
- If `1 ≤ t ≤ k`: Output should be `t` (number of standing spectators).
- If `k < t ≤ n`: Output should be `k` (number of standing spectators).
- If `n < t < n + k`: Output should be `n + k - t` (which decreases from `k` to `0`).

### Program Code Breakdown:
The program evaluates the time `t` using the following logic:
- **First Condition**: If `t <= k`, it prints `t`.
- **Second Condition**: If `t <= n` (and therefore `k < t <= n`), it prints `k`.
- **Third Condition**: If `t > n`, it computes and prints `n + k - t`.

### Verification of the Logic:
1. **Case 1** (`t <= k`): The program correctly outputs `t`, matching the expected output.
2. **Case 2** (`k < t <= n`): The program correctly outputs `k`, matching the expected output.
3. **Case 3** (`n < t < n + k`): The program computes `n + k - t`, which correctly results in the expected number of standing spectators.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program correctly differentiates between the three cases based on the value of `t` and produces the correct output accordingly. As all outputs conform to the problem description regardless of the input values given the constraints:

Correctness: **True**
