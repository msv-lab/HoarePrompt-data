The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned values from the input, where each value is expected to be an integer. Since the input is read through `map(int, input().split())`, the new values of `n`, `k`, and `t` will be whatever integers are provided as input.

Since the specific values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are not provided, the output state will reflect that they are now assigned the integers from input.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers assigned from input values.**
