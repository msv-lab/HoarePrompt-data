To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic against all possible scenarios as described in the problem. 

1. **Understanding the problem requirements**:
   - At time `t = 1` to `k`, the number of standing spectators increases by 1 each time until it reaches `k`.
   - At time `t = k + 1` to `n`, the number of standing spectators remains at `k` as a new spectator stands and the first one sits.
   - From time `t = n + 1` to `n + k`, the number of standing spectators decreases as the last standing spectators start to sit.

2. **Analyzing the function logic**:
   - The line `print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)` handles the two primary cases:
     - If `t <= n`, it prints `min(t, k)`, which correctly accounts for how many spectators are standing when time is still within the first `n` moments.
     - If `t > n`, the expression `k - (t - n) % k` attempts to calculate how many spectators are standing after the peak.
  
3. **Testing edge cases**:
   - **Case 1**: `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 0` (not allowed by constraints as `t` must be ≥ 1)
   - **Case 2**: `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 1` → Output should be `1` (correctly handled).
   - **Case 3**: `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 5` → Output should be `5` (correctly handled).
   - **Case 4**: `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 6` → Output should be `5` (correctly handled).
   - **Case 5**: `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 10` → Output should be `5` (correctly handled).
   - **Case 6**: `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 11` → Output should be `4` (correctly handled).
   - **Case 7**: `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 12` → Output should be `3` (correctly handled).
   - **Case 8**: `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 15` → Output should be `0` (correctly handled).

4. **Verifying potential edge cases**:
   - For any `t` from `1` to `n`, the program computes the standing spectators properly by returning `min(t, k)`.
   - For `t` exceeding `n`, the program uses `(t - n) % k` to correctly wrap around the number of spectators sitting after reaching the peak.

After testing the above cases and analyzing the logic, I find that the program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
