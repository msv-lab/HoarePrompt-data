Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` reflects the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' such that counts[char] is equal to or less than `target_count`, and `i` is `n`. If `result[i]` is '?', then `result` contains characters from `counts` that are less than `target_count`, and `i` remains `n`.***
