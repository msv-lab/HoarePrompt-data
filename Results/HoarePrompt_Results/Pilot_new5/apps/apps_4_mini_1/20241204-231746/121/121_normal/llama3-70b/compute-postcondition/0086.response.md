Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; if `c` is '?', then `res` contains the characters from `ACGT` added in order based on the availability in `count`, with `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` reflecting their final decremented values or remaining unchanged if not used; if all counts were greater than 0, then `res` includes all characters from `ACGT` up to the available counts. Otherwise, if `c` is a character from `s` that is not equal to '?', then `res` is updated to include `c`, and the previous index is incremented by 1, with `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` reflecting their current values or decremented if applicable.***
