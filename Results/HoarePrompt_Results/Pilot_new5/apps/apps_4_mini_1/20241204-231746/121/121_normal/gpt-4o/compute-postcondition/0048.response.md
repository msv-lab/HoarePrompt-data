Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` is a list containing 4 elements. If the count at index `char` is less than `target_count`, the element at `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `char` is the next character in the counts list, `index` is 1, and `result[1]` is equal to `char`. After this operation, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
