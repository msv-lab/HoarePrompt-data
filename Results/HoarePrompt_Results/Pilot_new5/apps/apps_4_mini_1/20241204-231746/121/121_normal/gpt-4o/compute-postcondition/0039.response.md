Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` is a list containing exactly 4 elements, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, for all characters in `counts`, `counts[char]` is less than or equal to `target_count`, `result` is a list of characters from `s`, `i` is 0, the character at `result[0]` is a '?', and the current value of `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`.***
