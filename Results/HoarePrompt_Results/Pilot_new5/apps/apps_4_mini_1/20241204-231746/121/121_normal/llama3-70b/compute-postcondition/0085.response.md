`res` is updated to include the character `c`. The variable `c` is a character from the string `s`, and it is not equal to '?'. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a character from `s` that is not equal to '?', `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` must reflect their current values or decremented if applicable, `res` is updated to include `c`, and the previous index incremented by 1.**
