The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` has at least `n + 1` characters, `char` is the next character in `counts` after the current one, `i` remains `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
