Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` is a list containing exactly 4 elements, and `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, `result` is updated such that `result[0]` equals `char`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
