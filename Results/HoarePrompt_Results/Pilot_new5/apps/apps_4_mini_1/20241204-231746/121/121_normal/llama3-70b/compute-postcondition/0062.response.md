Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the next character from `s`, `count['?']` remains 0, `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` are all either equal to 0 or decremented from their original values based on their initial counts. `res` contains the characters added in the order of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' until their counts reach 0 or they are exhausted, and `nc` is the last character checked in the loop, which would be either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' depending on the availability of counts. If no characters were available, `res` remains unchanged.**
