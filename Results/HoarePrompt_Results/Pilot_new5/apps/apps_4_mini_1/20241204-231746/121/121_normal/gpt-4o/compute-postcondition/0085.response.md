The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` contains 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with counts less than or equal to `target_count`, `char` is the next character in `counts`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
