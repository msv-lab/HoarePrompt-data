Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the next character from `s`, `count['?']` remains 0, `count['C']` is one less than its previous value, `count['A']` is also one less than its previous value if it was greater than 0, `nc` is 'A', if `count['A']` was greater than 0, `res` is updated to include 'A' and `count['A']` is decremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count['A']` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `res` and `count['A']` remains the same.***
