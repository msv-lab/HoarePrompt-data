Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a string `operations` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the effective change in coordinates from the operations and determines the number of operations that did not contribute to reaching the target coordinates `(x, y)`. If the target coordinates are unreachable based on the operations, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the count of operations that did not alter the expected final position. **
