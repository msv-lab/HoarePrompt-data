Initial State: `final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `current_x` is some value; `current_y` is some value; `dx` is some value; `dy` is some value; `i` is some value less than `n`; `operations` is a list of characters consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `position_map` is a dictionary with coordinates as keys and indices as values.

```
target_pos = current_x + dx, current_y + dy
```

Now, please think step by step: The code assigns `target_pos` to a tuple consisting of `current_x + dx` and `current_y + dy`. The values of `current_x`, `current_y`, `dx`, and `dy` are directly involved in the calculation, but no specific values are given for them in the initial state. Thus, the output state reflects that `target_pos` is now determined by this calculation, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `current_x` is some value; `current_y` is some value; `dx` is some value; `dy` is some value; `i` is some value less than `n`; `operations` is a list of characters; `position_map` is a dictionary.**
