The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a string `operations` of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the final position after applying all operations to the starting point `(x, y)`. If the final position is the same as the original position, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the minimum length of a contiguous substring of operations that leads back to a previously visited position, or -1 if no such substring exists. The function does not handle cases where `operations` may contain invalid characters, nor does it specifically check for scenarios where `n` is 0, though it assumes `n` is always a positive integer.
