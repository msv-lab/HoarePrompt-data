Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Impossibility**: 
   The program checks if `dx < 0 or dy < 0` to determine if it's impossible to reach the target coordinates `(x, y)`. However, this condition does not accurately reflect the feasibility of changing the operations to reach the target. It should instead check if the total number of moves (in terms of the counts of U, D, L, R) is sufficient to reach the desired coordinates.

2. **Count of Necessary Changes**: 
   The program counts `res`, which is the number of operations that did not modify `dx` or `dy`. However, this does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be changed to achieve the target position. The program should actually track the indices of the operations needed to be changed and compute the range based on that.

3. **Handling of Directions**:
   The logic does not account for the proper adjustment of coordinates when moving in the opposite direction. The program should be able to calculate how many operations need to be changed from each direction to match the required final coordinates, rather than just reducing counts.

4. **Missing Output for Impossible Cases**:
   The program does not handle cases where the movements are insufficient to reach `(x, y)`. It should check whether the total available movements in both axes are enough to reach the desired coordinates and appropriately return `-1` if not.

Overall, the logic for determining the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed is flawed, and the check for impossibility is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.
