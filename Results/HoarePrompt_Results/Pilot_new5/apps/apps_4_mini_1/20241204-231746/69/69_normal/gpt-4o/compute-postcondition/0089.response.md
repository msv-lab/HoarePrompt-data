The code snippet provided assigns `target_pos` the value of the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`. The values of `current_x`, `dx`, `current_y`, and `dy` are crucial for determining the new position.

As no specific values are provided for `current_x`, `dx`, `current_y`, and `dy`, we will keep them in their variable form.

The states of the other variables (`final_x`, `final_y`, `operations`, `min_length`, `position_map`, `count_R`, `count_L`, `count_U`, `count_D`, `i`, and `n`) are not directly affected by this operation in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; other variables remain unchanged.**
