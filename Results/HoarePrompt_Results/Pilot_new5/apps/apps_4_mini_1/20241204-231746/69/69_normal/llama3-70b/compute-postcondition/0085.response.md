The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and two integers `x` and `y`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The parameter `operations` is a string of length `n` that consists of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers that can take values in the range of -10^9 to 10^9. 

After executing the function body, it processes the `operations` string to alter the coordinates represented by `x` and `y` based on the characters in the string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a string operations of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers x and y. It returns the final coordinates (x, y) after applying the operations represented by the string to the initial coordinates (x, y).**
