The variable `current_y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_y` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot specify its exact new value, but we know it has increased by 1. The other variables `final_x`, `final_y`, `operations`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`, `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 0, and `current_y` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `operations` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 0; `current_y` is incremented by 1.**
