The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1. The value of `final_y` was set based on the second character of `operations`, and it remains a derivation of that character. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is within the range -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `y` is within the range -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9, `final_x` is set based on the second character of `operations`, `final_y` is incremented by 1, `index` is 1, and `op` is the second character in `operations`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is within the range -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `y` is within the range -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9, `final_x` is set based on the second character of `operations`, `final_y` is the previous value of `final_y` + 1, `index` is 1, and `op` is the second character in `operations`.**
