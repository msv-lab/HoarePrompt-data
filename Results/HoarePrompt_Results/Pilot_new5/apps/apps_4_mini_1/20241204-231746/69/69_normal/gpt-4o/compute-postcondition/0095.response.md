The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000. The parameter `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers within the range -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9. 

After executing the function body, the function will return:
- If certain conditions are met (Case_1), it returns 0.
- If no such conditions are met (Case_2), it returns `min_length` if it is not equal to float('inf'), indicating the minimum length of the substring that brings back to a previously visited position; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating no such substring exists.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a string `operations`, and two integers `x` and `y`, and return either 0 or the minimum length of a substring that returns to a previously visited position, or -1 if no such substring exists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a string operations of length n consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers x and y. It returns 0 in certain conditions or the minimum length of a substring that returns to a previously visited position, or -1 if no such substring exists.**
