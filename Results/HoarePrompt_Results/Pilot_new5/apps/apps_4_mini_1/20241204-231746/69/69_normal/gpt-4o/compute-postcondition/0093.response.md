Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`, `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`, `min_length` is the minimum length of the substring that brings back to a previously visited position, `position_map` contains the last index of each visited `(current_x, current_y)` position, `current_x` and `current_y` represent the final position after executing the operations in the string, `operations` is the original string of operations.**
