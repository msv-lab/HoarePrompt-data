The value of `current_y` is incremented by 1. The other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy + 1)`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i`; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy + 1)`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i`; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`; `current_y` is increased by 1.**
