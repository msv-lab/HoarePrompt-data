Postcondition: ***`ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L', `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D', `n` is greater than 0, and `ops` must have at least one element remaining. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1; if `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is increased by 1; otherwise, `res` is incremented by 1.***
