The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which takes two space-separated integer inputs. The previous values of `x` and `y` are not known, as they are now being set directly from the input. The states of the other variables, `n` and `operations`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers assigned from input values.**
