The value of `dx` is incremented by 1. Since `dx` is defined as `x - ux` and must be greater than or equal to 0, incrementing it by 1 will result in a new value that is still non-negative. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux` is the count of 'R' in `operations` minus the count of 'L' in `operations`, `uy` is the count of 'U' in `operations` minus the count of 'D' in `operations`, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is equal to `x - ux + 1`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `dx` is greater than or equal to 1, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, `ops` must have at least one element, either `op` is 'D' or `dx` is equal to 0, and `op` is 'L' while the current value of `dx` is less than 0.

Output State: **`ux` is the count of 'R' in `operations` minus the count of 'L' in `operations`, `uy` is the count of 'U' in `operations` minus the count of 'D' in `operations`, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is equal to `x - ux + 1`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `dx` is greater than or equal to 1, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, `ops` must have at least one element, either `op` is 'D' or `dx` is equal to 0, and `op` is 'L' while the current value of `dx` is less than 0.**
