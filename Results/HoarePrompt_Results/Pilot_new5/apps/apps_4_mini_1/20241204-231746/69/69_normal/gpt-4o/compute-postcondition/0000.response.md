The variable `final_x` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Other variables such as `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers within the range -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0**.
