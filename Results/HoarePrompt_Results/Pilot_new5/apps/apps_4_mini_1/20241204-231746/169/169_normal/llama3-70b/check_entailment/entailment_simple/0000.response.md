To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze how it processes the operations described in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
1. Vasya can perform two operations: taking a stone (represented by '-') and adding a stone (represented by '+').
2. The goal is to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after `n` operations have been conducted.
3. The pile cannot be empty when Vasya attempts to take a stone, which means there must be enough initial stones to accommodate the '-' operations.

### Program Analysis:
The program performs the following:
- It reads the integer `n` (the number of operations) and the string `s` which contains `n` operations.
- It counts the occurrences of '-' (let's call this `minus_count`) and '+' (let's call this `plus_count`).
- The logic implemented in the `if` statement checks if `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`:
  - If true, it prints `0`.
  - If false, it prints `plus_count - minus_count`.

### Verification of Logic:
1. If the number of '-' operations is greater than '+' operations, it implies that Vasya cannot start with fewer than `minus_count` stones to avoid going negative. Thus, the minimal stones left would be `0` (if he starts with at least `minus_count`).
  
2. If `minus_count` is less than or equal to `plus_count`, the program calculates the difference `plus_count - minus_count`. This difference represents the net increase in stones after accounting for stones taken away. 

#### Case Analysis:
- In the case where all operations are '-', the program correctly outputs `0` since taking too many stones without enough initial stones would lead to negative stones otherwise.
  
- In the case where all operations are '+', the program outputs `plus_count`, which is correct since it implies that all those stones have been added.

- In mixed cases such as '-+' or any other variation, the calculation of `plus_count - minus_count` accurately represents the stones left after the operations, assuming that the initial number of stones is at least `minus_count`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all cases correctly according to the problem description about the operations Vasya can perform. It ensures that it respects the condition that the pile must not be negative at any point and provides the correct final stone count based on the operations.

Thus, the program is correct. 

Correctness: **True**
