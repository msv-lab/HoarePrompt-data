The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` must remain a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, as stated in the initial condition. The value of `s` is not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'**
