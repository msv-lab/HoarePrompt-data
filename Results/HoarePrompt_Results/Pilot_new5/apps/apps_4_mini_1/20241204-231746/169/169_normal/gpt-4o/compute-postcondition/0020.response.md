Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operation` is the next character in `s`, and `index` is less than `n`. If `operation` is '+', `stones` is increased by 1. If `operation` is '-', `stones` is updated to `stones_initial - 1` if `stones_initial > 0`, or remains 0 if `stones_initial` was 0.***
