The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of the characters '+' and '-'. It processes the operations represented by the string to calculate a count of "stones", where each '+' increases the count by 1 and each '-' decreases the count by 1, ensuring that the count does not fall below 0. The final count of stones is printed as the output.
