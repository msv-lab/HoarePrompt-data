According to the code, the loop will execute based on the string `s`. Since `s` is guaranteed to have a length of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer from 1 to 100, the loop will execute at least once because the condition ensures that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `stones` is 0, but since we are just verifying the state before the loop starts, we only need to confirm that the loop can begin. The variable `operation` will take the value of each character in the string `s` during the loop execution.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to maintain the existing states and ensure that the loop can start properly with `operation` being the first character of `s`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `stones` is 0, `operation` is the first character of `s`**.
