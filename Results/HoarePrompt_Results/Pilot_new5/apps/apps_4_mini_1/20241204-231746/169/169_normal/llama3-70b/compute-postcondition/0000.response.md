The value of `n` is assigned by the expression `int(input())`, where `input` will accept a user input that must be convertible to an integer. Given that `n` is already defined as a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, the new value of `n` will be set to whatever integer the user inputs, as long as it falls within that range. The variable `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length n consisting of symbols "-" and "+"; `n` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 100.**
