To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the behavior of the program.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs:**
   - A positive integer `n` (number of operations).
   - A string `s` of length `n` consisting of symbols: "+" (addition of a stone) and "-" (removal of a stone).

2. **Outputs:**
   - The goal is to determine the minimal possible number of stones left after `n` operations.

3. **Constraints:**
   - Vasya can only remove stones if there are stones present in the pile.
   - The minimal number of stones cannot be negative.

### Program Behavior:
1. The program counts the occurrences of "-" and "+" in the string `s` using `minus_count` and `plus_count`.
2. If `minus_count` (removals) exceeds `plus_count` (additions), it prints `0`. This is correct because if there are more removals than additions, we cannot have a negative number of stones.
3. If `plus_count` is greater than or equal to `minus_count`, it prints `plus_count - minus_count`. This reflects that for every removal, there was a corresponding addition, and any excess additions will yield the final count of stones.

### Validation Against the Problem Description:
- The program handles all possible cases:
  - If only removals are present (e.g., "---"), it correctly returns `0` since we can't have less than `0` stones.
  - If only additions are present (e.g., "++++"), it correctly counts the stones as `4`.
  - For mixed operations (e.g., "-+"), it correctly calculates the minimum number of stones by ensuring no negative stones are counted.

### Edge Cases:
- The program adheres to the constraints set in the problem description:
  - It correctly prevents a negative number of stones.
  - It handles the maximum input size with no issues.

### Conclusion:
The program implements the required logic to determine the minimal possible number of stones left after `n` operations as described in the problem statement. It effectively uses the counts of each operation to arrive at the correct output.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be stated as:

Correctness: **True**
