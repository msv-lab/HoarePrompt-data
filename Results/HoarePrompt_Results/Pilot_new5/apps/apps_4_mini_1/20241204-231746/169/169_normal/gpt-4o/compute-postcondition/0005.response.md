The value of `stones` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `stones` is 0, so after the execution of the code, the new value of `stones` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `stones` is now 1, and the current value of `operation` is '+'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `stones` is 1, and the current value of `operation` is '+'**.
