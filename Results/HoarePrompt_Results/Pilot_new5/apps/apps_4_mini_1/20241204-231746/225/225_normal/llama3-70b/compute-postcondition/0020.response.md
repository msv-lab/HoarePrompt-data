According to the code, the loop will execute again if the value of `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. The condition for `n` must also hold, so it should still be greater than or equal to 2. 

State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and if `s[i]` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is set to 1.**
