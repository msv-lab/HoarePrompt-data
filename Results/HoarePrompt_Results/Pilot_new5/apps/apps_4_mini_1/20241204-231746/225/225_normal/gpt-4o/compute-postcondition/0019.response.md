The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and its length does not exceed 100. The function calculates the maximum jump distance based on the position of the last vowel found in the string `s`. If no vowels are present, the function returns -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty string `s` and return the maximum jump distance based on the index of the last vowel or -1 if no vowels are found.
