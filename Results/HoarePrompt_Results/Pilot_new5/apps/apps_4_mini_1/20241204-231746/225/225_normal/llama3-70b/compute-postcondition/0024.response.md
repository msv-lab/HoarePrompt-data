To determine the output state after executing the given code, we need to analyze the initial conditions and the impact of the code snippet provided.

Initial State: 
- `s` is an input string of capital English letters 
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY' 
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2 
- `i` is 2 
- If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 3. 
- Otherwise, if `s[i]` is a vowel, `last_vowel` is set to 1; `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and 1.

Now, the code snippet `last_vowel = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `last_vowel`.

Thus, the state of `last_vowel` changes from its previous value (which can be -1 or any other integer) to 2.

The other variables remain unchanged, so we will retain their previous definitions.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 2.**
