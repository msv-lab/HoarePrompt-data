Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 1. If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of `max_jump` and 2. Otherwise, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of `max_jump` and the value calculated by (1 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1.***
