The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of capital English letters and returns the maximum distance (jump) between consecutive vowels in the string. If no vowels are found, it returns the length of the string since no maximum jump can be defined. The maximum jump is calculated based on the positions of vowels and the edges of the string. If there are no vowels in the string, the function will return the length of the string, which is not covered by the annotations.
