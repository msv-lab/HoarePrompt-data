The code `max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)` assigns `max_jump` the greater of its current value or `i + 1`. The variable `i` is currently 2, so `i + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 3. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 3.**
