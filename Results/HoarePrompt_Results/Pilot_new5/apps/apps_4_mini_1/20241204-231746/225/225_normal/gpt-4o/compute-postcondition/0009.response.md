To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code.

Initial State:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `prev_pos` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `len(s)` must be greater than 1.

The code snippet:
```
max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
```

Here, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the difference between `i` and `prev_pos`. 

1. The value of `i` is 1 and `prev_pos` is 0, so `i - prev_pos` equals `1 - 0 = 1`.
2. The result of `max(max_jump, 1)` depends on the current value of `max_jump`, which is not defined in the initial state. We can only assume that it retains its previous value or is initialized to a value that is not specified. Therefore, the effect of this line of code cannot be explicitly defined in terms of a specific value for `max_jump`.

The other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `prev_pos`) remain unchanged, and we are not updating `max_jump` directly, as we need its original value for comparison.

Since we cannot determine what `max_jump` was before, we just acknowledge that `max_jump` will be set to either its original value or 1, depending on which is larger.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `prev_pos` is 0, `i` is 1, and `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1.**
