Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, and `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`. If `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value calculated as (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1. If `last_vowel` is equal to `n - 1`, `max_jump` remains unchanged.***
