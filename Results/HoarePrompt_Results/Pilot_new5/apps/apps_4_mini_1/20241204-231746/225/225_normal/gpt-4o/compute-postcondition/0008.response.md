According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the index `i` and the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(s)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` becomes 1, and the loop can execute again if `len(s)` is greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `prev_pos` is 0, `i` is 1, and `len(s)` must be greater than 1**
