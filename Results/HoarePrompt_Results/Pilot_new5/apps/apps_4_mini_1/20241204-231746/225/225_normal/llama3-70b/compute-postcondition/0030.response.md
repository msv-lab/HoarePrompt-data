The `print(max_jump)` statement outputs the current value of `max_jump`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation, and since there are no changes to the state of the program from this line of code, we will keep the initial conditions intact.

Output State: **`s` is a string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`, and `max_jump` remains unchanged.**
