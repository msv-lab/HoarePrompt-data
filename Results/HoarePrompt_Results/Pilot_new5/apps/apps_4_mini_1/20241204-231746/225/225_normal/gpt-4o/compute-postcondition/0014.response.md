The variable `prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is 2, so `prev_pos` now becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `prev_pos` is 2, `i` is 2, and `max_jump` is either its previous value or 2.
