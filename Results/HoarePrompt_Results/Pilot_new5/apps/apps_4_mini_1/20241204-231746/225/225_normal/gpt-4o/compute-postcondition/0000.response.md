The variable `vowels` is assigned a set containing the uppercase vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged as the code only initializes the `vowels` variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100; `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100; `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}**.
