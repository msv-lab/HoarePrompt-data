In the given code snippet, `max_jump` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the calculated value `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. 

Since we know that `last_vowel` is not equal to -1 and `i` is initialized to 0, we can substitute those values into the calculation. The expression becomes `(0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. 

The output state will include the updated value of `max_jump` while retaining all relevant information about the precondition variables.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, the current character `s[0]` is a vowel, `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, and `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, (0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)**.
