The variable `ratings_after` is assigned a new empty list. The variable `ratings_before` remains an empty list, and `n` retains its integer value within the specified range (2 to 1000). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list; `ratings_after` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list; `ratings_after` is an empty list.**
