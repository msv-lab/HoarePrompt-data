The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of participants and their respective ratings before and after a round of competition. It reads `n` pairs of ratings and determines whether the results are classified as 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe' based on the following conditions: if any participant's before rating differs from their after rating, it outputs 'rated'; if all participants have the same ratings before and after, it outputs 'unrated'; otherwise, it outputs 'maybe' if there is at least one pair of ratings where the before rating is less than the after rating while the overall ratings are not all equal.
