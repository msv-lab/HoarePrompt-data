According to the code, the `for` loop will execute `n` times, with `_` representing the current iteration index. The loop will continue until `_` reaches `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, meaning it has completed the first iteration, and there are `n` iterations in total. 

Since `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \), and the loop has just completed one iteration, it will execute again as long as `_` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1.

Thus, if `_` is 1, it will be 2 in the next iteration. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 2, which is already given.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)` with the new values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is set to True.**
