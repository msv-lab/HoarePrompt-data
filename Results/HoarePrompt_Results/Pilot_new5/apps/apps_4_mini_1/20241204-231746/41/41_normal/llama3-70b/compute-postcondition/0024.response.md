Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` contains `n` integers, and `ratings_after` contains `n` integers. If `ratings_before[0]` is less than `ratings_before[1]` and `ratings_after[0]` is greater than `ratings_after[1]`, then `rated` is set to False, `unrated` is set to False, `maybe` remains True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe` remain unchanged.***
