The statement `break` causes the program to exit from the most internal loop or if statement that is currently being executed. The values of the variables do not change due to this operation, but we note that we are breaking out of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \)
- `i` is less than `n - 1`
- `unrated` remains `False`
- `j` is \( n - 1 \)

Since the loop executes, and we are breaking out of it, the output state will reflect that we have exited the loop but will retain the current values of all relevant variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `i` is less than `n - 1`, `unrated` remains `False`, `j` is \( n - 1 \), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
