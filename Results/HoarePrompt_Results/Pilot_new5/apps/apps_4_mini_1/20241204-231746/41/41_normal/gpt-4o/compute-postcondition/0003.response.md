The variable `is_unrated` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is False.**
