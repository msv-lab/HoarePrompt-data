Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` equals `i + 1`, if the value of `ratings_before[i]` is less than the value of `ratings_before[j]` and the value of `ratings_after[i]` is greater than the value of `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
