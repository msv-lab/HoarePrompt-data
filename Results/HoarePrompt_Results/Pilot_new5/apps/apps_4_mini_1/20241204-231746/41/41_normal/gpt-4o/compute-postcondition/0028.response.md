The value of `is_unrated` is assigned the value `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state, so there is no change. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, `i` is 2 if `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
