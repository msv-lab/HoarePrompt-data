The variable `rated` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables, `n`, `ratings_before`, and `ratings_after`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` integers obtained from user input; `ratings_after` contains `n` integers obtained from user input; `rated` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` integers obtained from user input; `ratings_after` contains `n` integers obtained from user input; `rated` is `False`.**
