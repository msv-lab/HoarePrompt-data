Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` contains `n` integers, `ratings_after` contains `n` integers, `unrated` is False, `rated` is either False or True depending on the conditions met during the loop, `maybe` remains True, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
