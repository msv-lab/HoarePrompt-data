Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and `j` is `i + 2` with `n` greater than `i + 2`. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
