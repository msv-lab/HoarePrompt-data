The `ratings` variable is initialized as an empty list. The variable `n` retains its value within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), but remains unchanged by this snippet of code. The state of the other variables is unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings` is an empty list.**
