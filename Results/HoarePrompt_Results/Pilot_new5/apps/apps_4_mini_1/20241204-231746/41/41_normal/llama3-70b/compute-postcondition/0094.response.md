The `print('maybe')` statement outputs the string 'maybe' to the console. It does not change any variables or their values. The states of `n`, `rated`, `unrated`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `rated` is False; `unrated` is False; `i` is `n`; `j` remains beyond the last index; output is 'maybe'**.
