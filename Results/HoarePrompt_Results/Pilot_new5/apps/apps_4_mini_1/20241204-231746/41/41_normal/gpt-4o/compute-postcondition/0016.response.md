The values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on the input provided, where both are converted to integers. The `ratings` tuple will now include the new values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, `is_rated` will be set to True. The previous state indicates that `a` and `b` were input integers, but their specific values are not known until input is received.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)`, and if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is set to True.**
