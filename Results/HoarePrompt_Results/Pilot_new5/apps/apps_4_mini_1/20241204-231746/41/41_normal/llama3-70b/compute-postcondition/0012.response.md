The values of `a` and `b` are assigned through the `input()` function, which prompts the user to enter two integers. This means that after the execution of the code, `a` and `b` will hold the values provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged in this execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` has the value indicating that `a` has been added to the list; `ratings_after` has the value indicating that both `b` and the previous values have been added to the list; `_` is equal to `n`; `a` is the user input integer; `b` is the user input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` has the value indicating that `a` has been added to the list; `ratings_after` has the value indicating that both `b` and the previous values have been added to the list; `_` is equal to `n`; `a` is the user input integer; `b` is the user input integer.**
