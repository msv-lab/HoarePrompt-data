    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is between 0 and `n // house_cost`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`; `b` is between 0 and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`; `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, and if `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` for any values of `a` and `b`, the program returns 'YES'; otherwise, if no combination of `a` and `b` satisfies this condition, the program does not return anything.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO' indicating that no combination of houses and cars satisfies the condition for remaining_after_cars to be divisible by computer_cost.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and determines if it is possible to purchase a combination of houses, cars, and computers such that the remaining money after these purchases is divisible by the cost of a computer. It returns 'YES' if such a combination exists, otherwise it returns 'NO'. Specifically, it checks all possible combinations of houses and cars that can be bought within the budget `n` and verifies if the leftover money can fully cover a computer's cost. If no valid combinations are found, it returns 'NO'.
