Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is between 0 and `n // house_cost`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`; `b` is between 0 and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`; `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, and if `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` for any values of `a` and `b`, the program returns 'YES'; otherwise, if no combination of `a` and `b` satisfies this condition, the program does not return anything.**
