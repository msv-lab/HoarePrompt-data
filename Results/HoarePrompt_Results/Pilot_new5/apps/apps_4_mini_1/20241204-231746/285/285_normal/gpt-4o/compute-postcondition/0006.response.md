The value of `remaining_after_cars` is computed as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The previous values of the affected variables are `remaining_after_houses`, `b`, and `car_cost`. Given the constraints, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `b` is 0, and `car_cost` is a positive integer that is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`. 

Since `b` is 0, the term `b * car_cost` equals 0. Therefore, `remaining_after_cars` will equal `remaining_after_houses`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is 0 to `n // 1234567`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`; `b` is 0; `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`.**
