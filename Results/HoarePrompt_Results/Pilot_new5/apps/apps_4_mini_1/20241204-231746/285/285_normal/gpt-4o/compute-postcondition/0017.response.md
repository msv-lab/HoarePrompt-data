Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is between 0 and `n // 1234567`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567`; `b` is 2; `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`; and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost` and is not divisible by `computer_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
