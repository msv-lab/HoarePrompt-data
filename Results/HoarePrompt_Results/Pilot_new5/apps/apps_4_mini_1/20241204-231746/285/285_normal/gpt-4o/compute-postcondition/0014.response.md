According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `b` and the condition that it must stay within the range calculated from `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`. The loop will iterate while `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `b` will become 2.

Next, we need to verify that the calculation of the range `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` allows for the next iteration. This means that `remaining_after_houses` should be sufficient such that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is at least 2, allowing `b` to take the value of 2.

Therefore, to satisfy the loop's condition for one more iteration, `remaining_after_houses` needs to be enough to ensure that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is at least 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is between 0 and `n // 1234567`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567` and must be such that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is at least 2; `b` is 2; `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost` and is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
