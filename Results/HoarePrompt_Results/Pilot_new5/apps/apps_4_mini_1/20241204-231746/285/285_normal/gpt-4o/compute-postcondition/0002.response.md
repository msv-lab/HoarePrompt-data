The variable `computer_cost` is assigned the value of `1234`. The initial values of `n`, `house_cost`, and `car_cost` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234.**
