The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables remain unchanged as the code does not modify any of them. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer at least 123456; `a` is 0; `b` is 2; `c` is equal to (n - 246912) // 1234, and 'YES' is printed.
