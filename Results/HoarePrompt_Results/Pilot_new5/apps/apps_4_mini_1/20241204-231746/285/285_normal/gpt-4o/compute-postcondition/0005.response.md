To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement.

1. **Understanding the Variables**: 
   - `remaining_after_houses` is computed as `n - a * 1234567`. Since `a` is in the range of `0` to `n // 1234567`, `remaining_after_houses` will be non-negative as long as `a` is chosen appropriately.
   - The loop iterates over `b` which is defined as `range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`. For the loop to execute, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be at least `0`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - Since `remaining_after_houses` is calculated based on `n` and `a`, we need to ensure that `car_cost` is a positive integer and that `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative. 
   - `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be at least `0`, which implies `remaining_after_houses` must also be non-negative, ensuring that `car_cost` is not greater than `remaining_after_houses`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, `a` must be chosen such that `a * 1234567` does not exceed `n`. This ensures that `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative.
   - The value of `b` at the start of the loop should be `0`.

To summarize, the necessary states to ensure that the loop executes correctly are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `house_cost` is 1234567, `a` is 0 to `n // 1234567`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * 1234567` (which must be non-negative), `b` is 0, and `car_cost` must be a positive integer that is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`.**
