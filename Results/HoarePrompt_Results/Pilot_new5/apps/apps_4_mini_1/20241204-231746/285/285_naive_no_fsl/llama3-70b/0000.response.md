Correctness: **False**

The program has a potential issue when checking for the non-negative integers a, b, and c. Specifically, the calculation of `c` may lead to negative results when the remaining value (after subtracting the contributions from houses and cars) is negative. This would violate the requirement that a, b, and c should be non-negative integers.

For example, consider the input `n = 1234567`. 

1. When `a = 1` (representing buying one house), the remaining value becomes `0` (`1234567 - 1234567 = 0`).
2. The loop for `b` would not execute (`for b in range(0)`), as its range is calculated based on the remaining value, which is zero. 
3. Thus, `c` would not be calculated, and the program would proceed to print "NO" instead of correctly identifying that `n` could be spent entirely on one house.

Therefore, there are cases where the program would incorrectly conclude it is not possible to spend all coins when it actually is.
