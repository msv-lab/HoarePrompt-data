Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Kolya can spend all his game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. It does this by iterating through all possible numbers of houses he could buy (using variable `a`) and then for each of those options, it calculates the remaining coins. It then checks how many cars he could buy (using variable `b`) and checks if the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer.

The program effectively covers all non-negative combinations of houses, cars, and computers that could equal the total of `n`. The approach ensures that all valid combinations are checked due to the nested loops, and it correctly returns 'YES' if any valid combination is found. If no valid combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, it returns 'NO'.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), this method is efficient enough because the largest number of iterations required in the worst-case scenario is manageable within the loop boundaries defined by the respective costs of houses and cars.

Overall, the program accurately addresses the problem description and provides the correct output for the examples given, as well as for other potential inputs within the specified range.
