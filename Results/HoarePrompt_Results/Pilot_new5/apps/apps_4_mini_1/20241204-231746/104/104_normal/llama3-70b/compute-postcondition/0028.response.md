To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop itself.

1. The provided state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100. This confirms that `n` is valid for the loop's upper bound.
2. The value of `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`. This means `i` has a valid range and will allow the loop to start from `i + 1`.
3. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1)`, which means it will iterate from `i + 1` to `n` inclusive. The loop's execution depends on whether `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`.

For the loop to start executing:
- Since `i` is at least 1, `i + 1` is at least 2. 
- We need to ensure that `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, meaning `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop starts are:
- Confirm that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (since `i` must be at least 1).
- The initial value of `j` does not need to be set beforehand, as it will be managed by the loop itself.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is not set beforehand**
