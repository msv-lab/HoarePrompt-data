According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. The variable `i` is currently 0, so the loop will iterate from 1 to `n`. 

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1, which it is since `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the loop will execute for `j` starting from 1 up to and including `n`.

Thus, the only necessary adjustments to the state before the loop starts would be to clarify the boundaries for `j`, which will start at 1 and can go up to `n`, inclusive.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
