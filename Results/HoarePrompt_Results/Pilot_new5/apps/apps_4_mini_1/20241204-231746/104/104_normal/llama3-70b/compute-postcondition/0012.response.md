The code snippet takes the maximum of `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`. The variable `j` is 3 and `i` is 0, so `j - i - 1` equals `3 - 0 - 1`, which is 2. The value of `max_erase` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and 2. However, since we do not have a specific initial value for `max_erase`, we will denote it as `max_erase` for the output.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `max_erase` is updated to max(`max_erase`, 2)**
