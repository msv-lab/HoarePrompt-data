Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is not set beforehand. The expression `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` is true, indicating that for each `k` in the range from `i` to `j-1`, the difference between the elements `a[k]` and `a[i]` equals the difference `k - i`.***
