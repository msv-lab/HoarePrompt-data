The statement assigns `max_erase` the maximum value between its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given that `j` is defined as `i + 2`, the expression simplifies to `j - i - 1`, which evaluates to `(i + 2) - i - 1` = `1`. 

Thus, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum between its previous value and `1`. Since the previous value of `max_erase` is not specified, it can either remain unchanged or be updated to `1` if it was less than `1`. 

The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `1`.**
