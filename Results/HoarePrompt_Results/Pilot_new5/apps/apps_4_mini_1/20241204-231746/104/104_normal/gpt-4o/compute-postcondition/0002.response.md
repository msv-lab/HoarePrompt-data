The variable `max_erase` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions regarding `n` and `a` are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a[0]` < `a[1]` < ... < `a[n-1]` <= 1000, with `a` now containing integers derived from the input; `max_erase` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a[0]` < `a[1]` < ... < `a[n-1]` <= 1000, with `a` now containing integers derived from the input; `max_erase` is 0.**
