The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length of at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `bind` is `n - 1`; the character at index `i` of `s` is not ']', and the character at index `i` of `s` is ':'; the condition `f` is true; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
