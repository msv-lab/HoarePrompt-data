Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is -1 if no ']' is found; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`, or -1 if ']' does not exist. If `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1 or `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, the output is -1. Otherwise, with `i` between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, if `start_colon` is -1, `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `i` is updated to `end_colon - 1`, the total number of '|' characters in the substring from `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon - 1` is counted as `pipe_count`, and `result`, equal to `4 + pipe_count`, is printed.***
