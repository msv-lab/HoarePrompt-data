Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length of at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is equal to ':', then if the condition `f` is true, `bind` is set to `n - 2`, otherwise, `bind` remains unchanged at -1.***
