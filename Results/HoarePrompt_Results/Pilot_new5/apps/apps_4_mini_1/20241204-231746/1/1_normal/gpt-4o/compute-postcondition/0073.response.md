According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `start_colon` and `end_colon`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `end_colon`.

At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows:
- `i` is between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`
- `start_colon` is not -1
- `end_colon` is greater than `start_colon` and `start_colon + 1` is less than `end_colon`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, we need to ensure that the new `i` remains less than `end_colon`.

Therefore, the new state will be:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` will become `i + 1`).

So, if `i` is currently `i`, the updated state must reflect `i + 1` as long as `i + 1` is still less than `end_colon`.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, now `i` is `i + 1` and `pipe_count` is updated based on `s[i]`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` is less than `bind`; `end_colon` is the index of the last colon character found in the substring from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1`, or -1 if no colon was found in that range; `start_colon` is not -1, `end_colon` is not -1, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, and `start_colon + 1` must be less than `end_colon; if `s[i]` is '|', then `pipe_count` is updated to 1 and `s[i]` is '|'; otherwise, `pipe_count` remains 0; `i` must be less than `end_colon`.**
