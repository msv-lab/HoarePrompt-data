Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length of at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `bind` is -1; `f` is True or False. If `s[i]` is equal to ']', then `bind` remains -1 and `f` is True. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is not ']', `bind` is set to `n - 3`, and if `s[i]` is equal to ':', then `bind` is set to `n - 3`, and if `f` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
