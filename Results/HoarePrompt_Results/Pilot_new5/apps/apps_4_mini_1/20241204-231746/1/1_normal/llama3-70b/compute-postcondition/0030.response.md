The `bind` variable is assigned the value of -1 directly. This does not affect the state of any other variables. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, and only `bind` has been explicitly set to -1.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length of at least 1; `n` is the length of `s`; `f` is True if at least one '[' was encountered before the first ':'; `ind` is the index of the first ':' encountered after the first '[' if such a ':' exists, otherwise `ind` remains -1; `i` is `n` after all iterations; `bind` is -1.**
