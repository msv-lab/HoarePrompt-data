The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or control structure. No variables are changed by this statement itself. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3; `bind` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or control structure.
