Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` is less than `bind`; if `start_colon` is -1, `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `i` is updated to `end_colon - 1`, `pipe_count` is the total number of '|' characters found in the substring of `s` from `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon - 1`, and `result`, which is equal to `4 + pipe_count`, has been printed.***
