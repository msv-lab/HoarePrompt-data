Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is updated to `i + 1`; if `s[i]` is '|', then `pipe_count` is incremented by 1 and `s[i]` remains '|'; otherwise, `pipe_count` remains unchanged, and `s[i]` is some other character. The conditions for `bind`, `ind`, `end_colon`, and `start_colon` remain valid as stated in the precondition.***
