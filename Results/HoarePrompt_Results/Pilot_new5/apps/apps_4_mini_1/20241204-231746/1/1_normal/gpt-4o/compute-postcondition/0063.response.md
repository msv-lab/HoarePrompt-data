Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `bind - 3`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` is less than `bind - 3`. If `s[i]` is equal to ':', then `end_colon` is set to `bind - 3`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
