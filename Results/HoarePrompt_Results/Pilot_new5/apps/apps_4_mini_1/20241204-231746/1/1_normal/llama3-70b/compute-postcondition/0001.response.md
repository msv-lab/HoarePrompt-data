The code assigns the length of the input string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, we know that `n` will hold the value representing the length of that string, which will be between 1 and 500,000 inclusive. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000 inclusive; `n` is the length of `s`.**
