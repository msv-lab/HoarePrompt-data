The variable `bind` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is defined as `n - 3` and that `n` is greater than 0, `i` will also be a non-negative integer (since `n` must be at least 4 for `i` to be non-negative). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3; `bind` is `n - 3`.**
