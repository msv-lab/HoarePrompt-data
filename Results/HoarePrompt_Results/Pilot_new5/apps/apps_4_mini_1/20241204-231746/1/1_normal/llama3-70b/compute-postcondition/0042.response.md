Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length of at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `bind` is -1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is ']', then `f` is True. Otherwise, `bind` is updated to `n - 1`, and if the character at index `i` of `s` is ':', then if `f` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
