The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `bind - 2` and `end_colon` is `bind - 2`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` must be less than `bind - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
