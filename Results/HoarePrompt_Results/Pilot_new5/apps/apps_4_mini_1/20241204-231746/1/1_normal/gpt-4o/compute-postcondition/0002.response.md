The variable `ind` is assigned the value `-1`. The initial states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length equal to `len(s)`; `n` is equal to `len(s)`; `ind` is -1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length equal to `len(s)`; `n` is equal to `len(s)`; `ind` is -1.**
