According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`, which is equal to `len(s)`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `ind` is initially -1 and is not relevant for the execution of the loop, we can focus on `n` and `i`. At the start of the loop, `i` will take the value of 0 during the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and the variable `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length equal to `len(s)`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0**
