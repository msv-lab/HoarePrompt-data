Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ind + 2`; `bind` is greater than `ind + 2`; `ind` is less than `bind - 1;` if `s[i]` is a colon character, then `start_colon` is set to `ind + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` is not a colon character, then no changes are made to `start_colon` or any other variables.***
