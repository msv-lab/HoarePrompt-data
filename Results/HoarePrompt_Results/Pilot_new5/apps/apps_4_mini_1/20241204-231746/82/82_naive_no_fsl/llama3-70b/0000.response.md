To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program.

1. **Understanding the Logic of the Program:**
   - The program reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It initializes `k` to `0` and calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the function `func_2`.
   - It enters a loop where it keeps increasing `k` and recalculating the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k`.
   - The loop continues until it finds an LCM that is not smaller than the minimum LCM found so far.
   - Finally, it prints `k - 1`.

2. **Identifying Potential Issues:**
   - The loop might not account for all possible values of `k` that yield the same minimum LCM.
   - Specifically, it could break prematurely if the LCM stops decreasing at a certain point, which might lead to missing a smaller `k` that results in the same minimum LCM.
   - For example, if `a = 6` and `b = 10`, the function correctly finds that `k = 2` minimizes the LCM. However, the logic assumes that once it finds a non-decreasing LCM, it should stop, which could be incorrect.
   - The program does not handle cases where incrementing `k` beyond a point might yield the same minimum LCM but with a smaller `k`.

3. **Test Case for Incorrectness:**
   - Let's consider `a = 12` and `b = 15`. 
   - For `k = 0`, LCM(12, 15) = 60.
   - For `k = 1`, LCM(13, 16) = 208.
   - For `k = 2`, LCM(14, 17) = 238.
   - For `k = 3`, LCM(15, 18) = 90 (this is actually lower than 60).
   - For `k = 4`, LCM(16, 19) = 304.
   - The program would stop at `k = 1` or `k = 2` without considering that `k = 3` produces a lower LCM than any previously computed LCM.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the potential for the program to miss valid `k` values that might yield the same or better LCMs, I conclude that the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
