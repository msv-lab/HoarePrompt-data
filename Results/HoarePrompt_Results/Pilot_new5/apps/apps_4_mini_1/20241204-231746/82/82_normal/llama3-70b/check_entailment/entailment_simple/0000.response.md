To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze what the program is doing and compare it to the required functionality.

### Problem Description Recap
Neko needs to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If multiple \( k \) values yield the same minimum LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be returned.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `k` is initialized to 0.
   - The variable `min_lcm` is set to the LCM of `a` and `b` using `func_2(a, b)`.

3. **Loop**:
   - A `while True` loop is used to increment `k` until the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is no longer less than the `min_lcm`.
   - If the new LCM is smaller, `min_lcm` is updated.
   - If not, the loop breaks, and `k - 1` is printed.

4. **Functionality of `func_1` and `func_2`**:
   - `func_1` computes the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two numbers.
   - `func_2` computes the LCM using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).

### Issues Identified
The main issue with the program arises from how it determines the optimal `k`:
- The program continues to increment `k` until it finds a case where the LCM does not decrease. This could cause it to stop before finding the smallest `k` that gives the minimum LCM.

### Example Case Evaluation
Consider the input \( a = 6, b = 10 \):
- For \( k = 0 \): LCM(6, 10) = 30
- For \( k = 1 \): LCM(7, 11) = 77
- For \( k = 2 \): LCM(8, 12) = 24
- For \( k = 3 \): LCM(9, 13) = 117
- For \( k = 4 \): LCM(10, 14) = 70
- For \( k = 5 \): LCM(11, 15) = 165
- For \( k = 6 \): LCM(12, 16) = 48
- For \( k = 7 \): LCM(13, 17) = 221
- For \( k = 8 \): LCM(14, 18) = 126
- For \( k = 9 \): LCM(15, 19) = 285
- For \( k = 10 \): LCM(16, 20) = 80
- For \( k = 11 \): LCM(17, 21) = 119
- For \( k = 12 \): LCM(18, 22) = 198
- For \( k = 13 \): LCM(19, 23) = 437
- For \( k = 14 \): LCM(20, 24) = 120
- For \( k = 15 \): LCM(21, 25) = 105
- For \( k = 16 \): LCM(22, 26) = 286
- For \( k = 17 \): LCM(23, 27) = 621
- For \( k = 18 \): LCM(24, 28) = 168
- For \( k = 19 \): LCM(25, 29) = 725
- For \( k = 20 \): LCM(26, 30) = 390
- For \( k = 21 \): LCM(27, 31) = 837
- For \( k = 22 \): LCM(28, 32) = 224
- For \( k = 23 \): LCM(29, 33) = 957
- For \( k = 24 \): LCM(30, 34) = 510
- For \( k = 25 \): LCM(31, 35) = 1085

The optimal \( k \) is 2, but if this process finds a non-decreasing LCM before testing all possibilities, it may return an incorrect result.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly find the optimal \( k \) because it may terminate without fully exploring all opportunities for smaller LCMs. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirement of finding the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).

Correctness: **False**
