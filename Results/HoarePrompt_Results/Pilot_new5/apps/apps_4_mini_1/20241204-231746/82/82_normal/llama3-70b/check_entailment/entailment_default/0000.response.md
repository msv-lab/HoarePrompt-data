To evaluate the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, let's analyze it step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
Neko needs to find a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`** computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( a \) and \( b \). This is correct as per the description.
   
2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`** computes the LCM using the formula:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
   This is also correct for valid positive integers \( a \) and \( b \).

3. The loop increments \( k \) starting from zero and computes the LCM for \( (a + k) \) and \( (b + k) \) until it finds a value that is not less than the previously computed minimum LCM. It prints \( k - 1 \) as the result.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The first function accurately calculates the GCD and thus handles the case when either value is zero properly, since GCD(0, x) = x is well defined.
- The second function computes the LCM using the GCD correctly, but the output hint mentions that it may lead to division by zero if the GCD is zero. However, according to the problem constraints \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9 \), the GCD will never be zero if both \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers.

### Edge Cases:
The main edge case to consider here is when \( a \) and \( b \) are equal. In this case:
- If \( k = 0 \), the LCM of \( a + 0 \) and \( b + 0 \) is simply \( a \) (or \( b \)).
- The program will correctly find that the smallest \( k \) such that the LCM is minimized is \( 0 \).

Another edge case could be when \( a \) and \( b \) are very close together (e.g., \( 1 \) and \( 2 \)). The program logic needs to ensure it correctly finds the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM, which seems to be handled correctly by incrementing \( k \) until it finds a local minimum.

### Conclusion:
- The algorithm is designed to find the minimum LCM efficiently by incrementing \( k \) and checking the LCM repeatedly.
- The output hints do not present a valid reason for the code's incorrectness since all defined ranges and operations will not lead to a division by zero.

Considering all of the above assessments, it appears that the code meets the specifications of the problem description correctly for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
