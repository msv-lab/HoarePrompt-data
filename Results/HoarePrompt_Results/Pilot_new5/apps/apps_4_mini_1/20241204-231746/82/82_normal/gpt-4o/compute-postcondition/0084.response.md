The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, constrained such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, it has two possible outcomes: 

- Case 1: The function returns `0` explicitly as stated in the return statement.
- Case 2: The function returns `min_k`, which is the candidate that resulted in the minimum least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`, with `min_lcm` representing the minimum LCM calculated for each valid candidate. If no valid candidates were found, `min_k` remains `0`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and based on certain conditions, it returns either `0` or the minimum candidate yielding the minimum least common multiple of modified values derived from `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns 0 or the minimum candidate that yielded the minimum least common multiple of modified values based on `a` and `b`.**
