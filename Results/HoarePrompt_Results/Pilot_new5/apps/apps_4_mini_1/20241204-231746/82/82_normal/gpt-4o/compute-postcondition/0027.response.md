The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The value of `current_lcm` is determined by the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, which is based on the updated values of `new_a` and `new_b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `candidate`, `min_k`, `new_a`, and `new_b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is as per the last update condition, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is as per the last update condition, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
