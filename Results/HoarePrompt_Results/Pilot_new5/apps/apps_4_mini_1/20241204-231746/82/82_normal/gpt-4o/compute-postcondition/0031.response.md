Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers. If `diff` is divisible by `k`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated for each candidate, with `min_k` being the candidate that yielded the minimum least common multiple, while `k` remains 1 and `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`. If the loop does not execute, `min_lcm` remains positive infinity and `min_k` remains 0.***
