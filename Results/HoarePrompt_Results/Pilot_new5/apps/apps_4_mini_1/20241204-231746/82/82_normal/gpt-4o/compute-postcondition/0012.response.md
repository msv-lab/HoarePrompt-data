Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `new_a` is `(a + abs(a - b) - 1) // abs(a - b) * abs(a - b)`, `new_b` is `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm`, the current value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
