According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and the condition of the loop itself. The loop iterates with `k` starting from 1 and goes up to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. If `diff` is a positive integer, then the maximum value of `k` that can be reached is `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `k` is 1 (the first iteration has just completed), and it will increment by 1 for the next loop iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. Additionally, `diff` should remain a positive integer to keep the loop condition valid.

In this case, since `k` starts from 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 2.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_k` is the candidate that yielded the minimum least common multiple, `k` is 2**
