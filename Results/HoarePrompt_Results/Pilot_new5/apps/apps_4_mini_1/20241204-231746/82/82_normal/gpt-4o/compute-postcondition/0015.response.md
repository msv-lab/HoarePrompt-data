Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is set to `diff`, `k` remains 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + abs(a - b) - 1) // abs(a - b) * abs(a - b)`, `new_b` is calculated as `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.***
