To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the functions, their descriptions, and the potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized, with a preference for the smallest `k` if there are ties.

### Code Breakdown:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm and returns it. It seems correctly implemented based on the description.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function computes the LCM of two integers by multiplying them and dividing by their GCD. The description notes that it does not handle the case of a zero GCD, leading to a potential division by zero error. However, since both `a` and `b` are positive integers (as specified in the problem), this function should work without triggering the error.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function handles the main logic. It first checks if `a` and `b` are equal, returning `0` in that case, which is correct.
   - The function then calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, iterating over possible divisors of this difference to find candidates for `k`. It computes the LCM of adjusted values of `a` and `b`, aiming to find the minimum LCM.
   - The logic seems reasonable and accounts for cases where `k = 0` is optimal.

### Edge Cases:
- **When `a = b`:** The function returns `0`, which is correct because no adjustments are needed.
- **When `a` and `b` are very close:** The function should correctly find the smallest `k` that minimizes the LCM but must be ensured that all potential small values of `k` are checked.
- **When `a` or `b` is much larger:** The algorithm should still correctly iterate through possible divisors of their difference.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the behavior and expectations of the functions are correctly aligned with the code. 

### Conclusion:
Given the problem description, the functions implemented, and the analysis of their behavior, the program correctly finds the smallest `k` that minimizes the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` for all given cases, including edge cases where `a` equals `b`, and for various differences.

No examples of failure were found in the analysis, and the output hints agree with the code's approach.

Correctness: **True**.
