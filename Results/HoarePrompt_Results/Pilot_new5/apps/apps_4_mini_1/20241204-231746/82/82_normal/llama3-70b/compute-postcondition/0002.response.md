Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) and returns the result of the expression `a * b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. However, if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0, this will lead to a division by zero error. The function does not handle this case, so it may result in an error during execution if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0. **
