The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, we incorporate this change into the output state, maintaining the information that remains valid.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
