Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`.***
