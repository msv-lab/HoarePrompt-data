Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is 3, `new_a` is equal to `(a + 2) // 3 * 3`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of 3 greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is set to 3.***
