The code snippet performs a simultaneous assignment, where `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` is equal to `b_initial`
- `b` is equal to `a_initial % b_initial`
- `a_initial` must not be a multiple of `b_initial`

Since `a_initial` is not a multiple of `b_initial`, `b` will be a non-zero value. 

After executing the code:
- `a` will take the value of `b`, which is `a_initial % b_initial`.
- `b` will take the value of `a % b`, which uses the updated value of `a`. In this case, since `a` has just taken the value of `b_initial`, we will calculate `b` as `b_initial % (a_initial % b_initial)`.

The output state will reflect these changes:

Output State: **`a` is equal to `a_initial % b_initial`, `b` is equal to `b_initial % (a_initial % b_initial)`**
