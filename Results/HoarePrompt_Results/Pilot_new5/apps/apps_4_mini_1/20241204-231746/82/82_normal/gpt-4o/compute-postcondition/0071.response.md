The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The value of `candidate` is equal to `diff // 3`, which is itself defined in the initial state. The other variables `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, and `min_lcm` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + diff // 3 - 1) // (diff // 3) * (diff // 3)`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `diff // 3`.**
