Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, finds candidates that could minimize the least common multiple (LCM) of adjusted values of `a` and `b`, and returns the smallest candidate that yields the minimum LCM. If no valid candidates are found, it returns 0. **
