To analyze the impact of the code on the variables, we note the following:

1. `candidate` is defined as `diff // 3`. Since `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `candidate` will also be a positive integer (at least 3).
2. The initial definition of `new_a` is provided, but it will be recalculated in the current code snippet: `new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
3. The expression for `new_a` will yield the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

Now let's update the relevant variables:

- `new_a` is recalculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
