To determine the output state, we start by analyzing the state of the variables and the operation performed by the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9
- `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`
- `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1`
- `a` is equal to `i * x`

The code snippet `b = z // i * x` modifies the variable `b`. 

To analyze this:
1. `z // i` computes the integer division of `z` by `i`. The result will be an integer since both `z` and `i` are integers.
2. The result of `z // i` is then multiplied by `x`, which is also an integer.

Now, since `z` is a variable that may not have been defined in the initial state, we indicate that `b` is calculated based on the values of `z` and `i`.

Therefore, `b` becomes a multiple of `x` relative to the integer division of `z` by `i`.

Output State:
**`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`; `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1; `a` is equal to `i * x; `b` is equal to `z // i * x`.**
