The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and it computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function correctly handles the case where `b` is initially 0, returning `a` as the GCD. If both `a` and `b` are positive, the function properly calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
