Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`; `i` is an integer representing (i + 1) less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(z)). If `z % i == 0`, then `a` is equal to `i * x` and `b` is equal to (z // i) * x. If `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r` and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y), then if `a` is equal to `b`, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` is increased by 2. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged. If `z % i != 0`, the value of `count` remains unchanged.***
