Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`; `z` is equal to `y // x`; `count` is the total number of valid pairs `(a, b)` found where `a` and `b` satisfy the conditions `l ≤ a ≤ r`, `l ≤ b ≤ r`, `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`. If no pairs satisfy these conditions, `count` remains 0.**
