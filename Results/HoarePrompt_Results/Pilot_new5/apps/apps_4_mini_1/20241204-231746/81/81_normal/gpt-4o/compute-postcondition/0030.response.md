Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`; `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1; `a` is equal to `i * x; `b` is equal to `z // i * x; if `a` is equal to `b`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` is increased by 2.***
