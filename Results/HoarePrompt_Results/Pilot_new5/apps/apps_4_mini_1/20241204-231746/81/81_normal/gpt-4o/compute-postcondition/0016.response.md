Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`. If `z % i == 0`, then if `l` ≤ `a` ≤ `r`, `l` ≤ `b` ≤ `r`, `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, `count` is incremented: if `a` equals `b`, `count` is set to 1; if `a` does not equal `b`, `count` is set to 2. If the condition is not satisfied, no operations related to `a`, `b`, or `count` are executed.***
