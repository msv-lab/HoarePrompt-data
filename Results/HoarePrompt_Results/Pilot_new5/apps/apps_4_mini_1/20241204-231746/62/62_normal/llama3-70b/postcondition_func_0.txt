The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, representing the digits of a number, and an integer `base`, representing the base in which the number is expressed. It computes and returns the integer equivalent of the digit list in the specified base. The function assumes that all digits are valid for the given base, meaning they are non-negative integers less than the base, and handles only valid inputs as per the annotations. If invalid inputs are provided, the function does not include error handling for such cases.
