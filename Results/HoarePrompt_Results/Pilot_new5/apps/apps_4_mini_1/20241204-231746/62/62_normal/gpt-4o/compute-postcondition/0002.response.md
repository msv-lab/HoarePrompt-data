The value of `decimal_value` is updated to `decimal_value * base + digit`. The initial value of `decimal_value` is 0, so the new value becomes `0 * base + digit`, which simplifies to `digit`. The `base` remains unchanged, and `digit` is still the first element in the `digits` list. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `decimal_value`.

Output State: **`digits` must have at least 1 element, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`, `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list**.
