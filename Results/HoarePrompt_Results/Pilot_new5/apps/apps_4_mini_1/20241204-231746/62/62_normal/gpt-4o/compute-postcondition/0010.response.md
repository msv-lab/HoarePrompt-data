Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, which represent the digits of a number in a specified base (which must be between 2 and 40), and an integer `base`. It calculates and returns the decimal representation of the number formed by those digits in the provided base. The function assumes that all digits are valid for the given base and that the list contains between 1 and 10 digits. No error handling for invalid digits (digits that are not less than the base) is included, which could lead to incorrect results if such cases arise. **
