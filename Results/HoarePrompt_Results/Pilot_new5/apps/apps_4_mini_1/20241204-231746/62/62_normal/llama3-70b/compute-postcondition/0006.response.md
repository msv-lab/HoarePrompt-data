The `result` is assigned the value of `result * base + digit`. The previous value of `result` is equal to `digit * base + digit`. Thus, the updated value of `result` can be calculated as follows:

1. Substitute the previous value of `result`:  
   `result = (digit * base + digit) * base + digit`
2. Simplify the expression:  
   `result = (digit * base + digit) * base + digit = digit * base^2 + digit * base + digit`

Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 digits, `digit` is the third digit in the list, `base` is an integer, and `result` is equal to `digit * base^2 + digit * base + digit`.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 digits, `digit` is the third digit in the list, `base` is an integer, `result` is equal to `digit * base^2 + digit * base + digit`.**
