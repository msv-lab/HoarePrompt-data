The variable `result` is updated to be equal to `result * base + digit`. The value of `result` is initially equal to `digit`, so after the operation, `result` will be equal to `digit * base + digit`. The values of `digits`, `digit`, and `base` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second digit in the list, `base` is an integer, `result` is equal to `digit * base + digit`.**
