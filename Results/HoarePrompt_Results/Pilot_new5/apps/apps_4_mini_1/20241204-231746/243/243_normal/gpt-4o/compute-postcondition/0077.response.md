The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Since `right` was previously calculated as `(low + high) // 2 + 2`, its new value becomes `((low + high) // 2 + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `(low + high) // 2 + 3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - k for some positive integer k; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `right` is equal to (low + high) // 2 + 3; and func_1(right) must remain equal to m.**
