According to the code, the loop can execute if `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `5 * (m + 1)`. Since `m` is a positive integer, `high` will always be greater than 0. Therefore, `low` (which is 0) is less than or equal to `high`, and the loop is able to execute at least one time.

No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time since the current conditions allow the loop to proceed.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is a positive integer equal to `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list.**
