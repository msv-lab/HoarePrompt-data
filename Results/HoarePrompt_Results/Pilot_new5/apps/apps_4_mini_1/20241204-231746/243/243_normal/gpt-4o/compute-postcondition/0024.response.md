According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` has been incremented by 1, and we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` still equals `m` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `func_1(right)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `right` or the conditions around `func_1` so that this equality holds true after the increment. Given that `func_1(right)` needs to remain equal to `m`, if it was equal just before the increment, we can say that `func_1(right - 1)` was equal to `m` prior to the increment. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we can state that:
- `func_1(right)` should still equal `m` after the increment. This would imply that the conditions of `func_1` must not change in such a way that `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`.

Therefore, we need to modify the definition or the constraints of `right` such that the state remains valid for the next iteration.

State: **`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` minus the number of times the loop executed, `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `func_1(right - 1)` equals `m, and `right` must remain unchanged for the loop to execute again.**
