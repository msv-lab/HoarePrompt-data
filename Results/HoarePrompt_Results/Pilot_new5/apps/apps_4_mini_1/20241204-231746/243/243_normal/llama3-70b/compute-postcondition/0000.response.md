The value of `m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `m` will now hold an integer value provided by the user. The precondition states that `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, so the value of `m` remains within this range. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `m` is an input integer**.
