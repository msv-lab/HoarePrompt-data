According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left`. The loop will execute as long as `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`, and since `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, there is no guarantee that `func_1(left)` will still return `m` in the next iteration. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `left`. Since `left` has been adjusted to `left - 1`, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` is still equal to `m`. This means `left` needs to be set such that `func_1(left)` returns `m`, which may not be guaranteed with the current adjustment. 

Thus, we need to reset `left` to a value that ensures `func_1(left) == m`. Since `left` is currently `left - 1`, we will need `left` to be at least `left + 1` or higher, depending on the function's behavior.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; left must be adjusted to a value such that func_1(left) is equal to m**
