The variable `left` is decremented by 1. The previous constraints state that `left` must be greater than or equal to 1, which means the value of `left` was at least 1 before the operation. After the operation, `left` will be less than or equal to its previous value, which maintains the condition that `left` must remain a valid positive integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is decreased by 1.**
