According to the code, since the loop condition is `while True`, the loop is designed to execute indefinitely and will run one more time regardless of the variables `m`, `count`, and `n`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 2; `n` is 1**
