The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The value of `low` is `0`, and `high` is equal to `5 * (m + 1)`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, `mid` will be calculated as follows:

```
mid = (0 + 5 * (m + 1)) // 2
   = (5 * (m + 1)) // 2
```

The variables `m`, `low`, `high`, and `result` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `mid` is (5 * (m + 1)) // 2; `result` is an empty list.**
