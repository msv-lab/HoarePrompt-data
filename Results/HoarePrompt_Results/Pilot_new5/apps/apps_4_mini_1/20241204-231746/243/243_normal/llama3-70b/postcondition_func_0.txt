The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user for an integer `m`, computes the number of integers from 1 to just below the first integer where \( n // 5^{\text{count}} < m \), and returns the count of these integers along with the integers themselves as a space-separated string. It may not handle edge cases where `m` is very small or large properly, potentially leading to an empty output.
