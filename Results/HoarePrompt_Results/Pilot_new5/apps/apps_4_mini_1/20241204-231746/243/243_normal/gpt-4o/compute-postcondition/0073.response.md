The value of `right` is updated to be `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `right` becomes half of the sum of `low` and `high` plus one. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - k for some positive integer k; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `right` is equal to (low + high) // 2 + 1.**
