To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the implemented functionality.

### Problem Requirements Summary
1. Given an integer `m`, we need to find the count of positive integers `n` for which `n!` (the factorial of `n`) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
2. We need to output the count `k` and then the actual integers `n` in increasing order.

### Implementation Analysis
The program reads an integer `m` and then uses a helper function `func_2(m)` to find all integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

- **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`. It does so by calculating how many times `5` can be factored from the numbers `1` to `n` because trailing zeroes in factorials are produced by pairs of `2` and `5`, and `2`s are more plentiful.
  
- **Function `func_2(m)`**:
  - The binary search approach is well-suited for efficiently finding the range of integers `n` that yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
  - The function uses `func_1(mid)` to determine how many trailing zeroes `mid!` has, and adjusts the search range based on whether it is less than, greater than, or equal to `m`.
  - If it finds a match (where `zeroes` equals `m`), it extends both directions (`left` and `right`) to find all consecutive integers that also yield `m` trailing zeroes. This ensures that it captures all valid `n`.

### Output Handling
- The output is handled properly. If valid integers are found, it prints their count and the integers themselves. If no valid integers exist, it prints `0`.

### Edge Cases
- For `m = 1`, it correctly identifies that `5!`, `6!`, `7!`, `8!`, and `9!` each have exactly `1` trailing zero and outputs these as specified.
- For larger values of `m`, if no integers are found that provide exactly `m` trailing zeroes, it correctly returns `0`.

### Conclusion
The implementation accurately follows the problem description by counting trailing zeroes in factorials and correctly identifying and outputting the integers. Thus, it meets all specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
