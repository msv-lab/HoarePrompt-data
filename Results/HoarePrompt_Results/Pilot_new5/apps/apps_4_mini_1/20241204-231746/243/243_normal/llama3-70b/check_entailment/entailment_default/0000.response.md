To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to identify the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count >= m:
            break
        count += 1
    n = 1
    ans = []
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count < m:
            break
        ans.append(n)
        n += 1
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `m`, which is in the specified range (1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000).
   
2. **First Loop**: 
   - The condition `if n // 5 ** count >= m` is used to determine when to stop counting. The purpose of this seems to be to find a count of how many factors of 5 are needed to reach at least `m` trailing zeroes in `n!`. However, `n` starts at `1`, and the loop does not increment `n`, which could lead to an infinite loop if `m` is small since `1 // 5^0 = 1 >= m (if m > 1)` will never be true.

3. **Second Loop**: 
   - This loop attempts to append `n` to the list `ans` as long as `n // 5 ** count < m`. However, it does not properly check and find all integers `n` that yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes. This means that it might miss valid integers that meet the criteria or not start from the correct base.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The hints indicate that the function calculates the number of integers from `1` to just below the first integer where `n // 5 ** count < m` and has concerns about handling edge cases where `m` is very small or large properly.

### Edge Case Consideration:
1. **Small Values of m**: For very small values of `m`, such as `m = 1`, the logic may not correctly identify all integers `n` whose factorials end with exactly one trailing zero. The expected output should be `5` (for `5!` to `9!`), but the code may fail to account for this correctly.
  
2. **Large Values of m**: The logic also fails for large values of `m`, possibly resulting in an incorrect range for `n`, as the computation of trailing zeroes fundamentally relies on how many times `5` is a factor in the numbers leading up to `n`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the issues identified in both the code and the output hints, the function does not handle edge cases properly, particularly with determining the correct count of integers `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeroes in `n!`.

Thus, the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
