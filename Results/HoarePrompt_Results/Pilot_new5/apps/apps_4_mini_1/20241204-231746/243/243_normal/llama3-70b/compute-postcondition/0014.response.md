Postcondition: ***`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 2; `n` is 1. If `n // 5 ** count` is greater than or equal to `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program does not execute any actions related to the else part, as there is no else part defined.***
