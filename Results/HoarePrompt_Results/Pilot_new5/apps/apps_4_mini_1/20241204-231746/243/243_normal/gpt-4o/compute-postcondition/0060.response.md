`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, which is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The values of `m`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged, but the value of `mid` is now defined as the average of `low` and `high`. The condition that `low` must be less than or equal to `high` still holds.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2**
