To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the while loop, which is `func_1(right) == m`. 

The current state at the end of the last iteration provides the following information:
- `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 3`.
- `func_1(right)` must currently be equal to `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` needs to remain equal to `m`. 

Since `right` is defined as `(low + high) // 2 + 3`, we also note that:
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Moving forward, we can infer that to ensure the loop can iterate again, `right` must increase just enough to meet the criteria that keeps `func_1(right)` equal to `m`. 

There are no specific values given for `low` or `high`, but the relationship between them is critical. Since `m` is a positive integer and `func_1(right)` can depend on the values of `low` and `high`, we could suggest that `right` must be adjusted appropriately if `func_1` has the capacity to change with an increase to `right`.

Given that `func_1(right)` must remain equal to `m`, it is possible that `right` should be adjusted to a value that still yields `func_1(right) == m`, which might suggest that `right` should adjust downwards to ensure we still reach `m`.

To maintain the state while ensuring the loop can execute one more time, we don't need to change anything else in the state provided since the conditions for `low`, `high`, and `m` are already satisfied.

Thus, we summarize the adjustments with the following statement:

State: **`left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - k for some positive integer k; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `right` is equal to (low + high) // 2 + 3; and func_1(right) must remain equal to m.**
