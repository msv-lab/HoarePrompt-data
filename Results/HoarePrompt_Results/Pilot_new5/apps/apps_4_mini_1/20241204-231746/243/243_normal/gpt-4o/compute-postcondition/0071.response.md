The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `left`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - 3; and func_1(left) must equal m**.
