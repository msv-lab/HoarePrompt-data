The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, it follows that `high` is at least equal to `mid`. Thus, after updating `high` to `mid - 1`, `high` becomes less than `mid`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `high` is equal to mid - 1.**
