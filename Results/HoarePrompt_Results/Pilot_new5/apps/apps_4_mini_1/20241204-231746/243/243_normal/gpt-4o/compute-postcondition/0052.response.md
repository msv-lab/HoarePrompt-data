To analyze the loop, we need to focus on the condition `func_1(right) == m`, which determines whether the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, meaning that the value of `mid + 1` is valid for the function that produces `m`.
- `right` is equal to `mid + 3`, which means that `func_1(right)` must also equal `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`. Since `right` is currently set to `mid + 3`, we need to ensure that the condition holds true.

However, if `right` is equal to `mid + 3`, and we want the loop to run again, we also need to ensure that any changes to `mid` in the next iteration still maintain `func_1(right) == m`. Additionally, since `left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, it indicates that `k` might change the original bounds for `left`, but does not directly affect `right` at this moment.

No states related to current variables need to be adjusted since we don't have constraints that suggest any of them need to change for the loop to execute again. However, we must ensure that `func_1(right)` continues to equal `m` when the next iteration starts.

State: **`left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, `right` is equal to `mid + 3`, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged**
