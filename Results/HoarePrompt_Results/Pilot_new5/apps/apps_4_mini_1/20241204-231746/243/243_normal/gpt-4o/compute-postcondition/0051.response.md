The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Since we know that `right` is currently equal to `mid + 2`, after the execution of `right += 1`, the new value of `right` will be `mid + 3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, `right` is equal to `mid + 3`, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged.**
