Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `low` is 0, `high` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` remains greater than `m`, and `result` is an empty list. Otherwise, `left` is updated to its initial value minus the number of times the loop executed, `low` is still 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `zeroes` becomes less than or equal to `m`, and `right` is adjusted to its original value plus the number of times the loop executed, while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
