The values of `low` and `high` are assigned based on the calculation involving `m`. Specifically, `low` is set to 0 and `high` is calculated as `5 * (m + 1)`. Since `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100000, `high` will be a positive integer within the range 10 to 500005.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is a positive integer equal to `5 * (m + 1)`.**
