The variable `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is unknown, but it must have been at least 1 for the statement to be valid (as `m` is a positive integer). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is decreased by 1.
