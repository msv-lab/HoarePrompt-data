Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, `low` is updated to (5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `low` is set to 0, `high` is updated to (5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1, and `zeroes` remains greater than `m`. Otherwise, `left` is updated to its initial value minus the number of times the loop executed, `low` is still 0, `high` remains 5 * (m + 1), `mid` is recalculated as (5 * (m + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is recalculated as the result of `func_1(mid)`, and `result` is updated to a list ranging from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, with `zeroes` becoming less than or equal to `m`, and `right` adjusted accordingly.***
