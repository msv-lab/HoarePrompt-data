In the provided code, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. 

Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, it is greater than or equal to `low` and less than or equal to `high`. Therefore, `high` must be at least equal to `mid`, and by subtracting 1, it will still be less than or equal to `mid`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of func_1(mid); `high` is now equal to `mid - 1`.**
