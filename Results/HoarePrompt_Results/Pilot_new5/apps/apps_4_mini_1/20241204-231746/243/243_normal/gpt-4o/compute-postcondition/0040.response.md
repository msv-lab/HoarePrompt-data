According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left`. The loop will execute as long as `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. 

Right before the loop, `left` is equal to `mid`, and `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `func_1(left)` needs to be equal to `m`. 

Since `func_1(mid)` is already defined and `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. This means that the value of `left` needs to be such that `func_1(left) == m`. 

Since `left` is initially set equal to `mid`, and `zeroes` (the result of `func_1(mid)`) may or may not be equal to `m`, we need to adjust `left`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we must also ensure that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `left` is in a state where it produces the condition for the loop to execute.

As `m` is a positive integer, `left` must be adjusted to ensure that `func_1(left)` returns the value `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` must be adjusted so that func_1(left) == m**
