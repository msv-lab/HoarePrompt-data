To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the code and look for any potential edge cases that it does not handle.

The problem asks for the number of positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The algorithm needs to correctly compute this by:

1. Finding the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` which is determined by the number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. Identifying all integers `n` where the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function `func_1(n)`** correctly counts the trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting how many times `n` can be divided by powers of 5. This is accurate according to the mathematical properties of factorials.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`** attempts to find all values of `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It performs a binary search to hone in on where the trailing zeroes equal `m`. If it finds such an `n`, it attempts to gather all `n` values around it that also yield the same number of trailing zeroes.

### Potential Issues

- The binary search in `func_2` initializes `low` to 0, and `high` to `5 * (m + 1)`. This seems reasonable, but the search may miss out on particular edge cases, especially if `m` is high. The maximum boundary could potentially be higher as `m` increases since the maximum number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is related to higher values of `n`.

- The loop that expands `left` and `right` to find ranges around `mid` looks for the exact conditions, but if `m` is not achievable (which it is not for certain values), the result list may not be correctly populated.

### Test Cases to Consider:

- **Case when `m = 5`:** This case should return `0` as `5!` has exactly 1 trailing zero but no `n!` for `n < 25` has 5 trailing zeroes. The output is correctly handled.

- **Case when `m = 1`:** This should return `5`, which corresponds to the integers `5, 6, 7, 8, 9` which all have exactly 1 trailing zero. This is also handled correctly.

- **Edge Case with large `m`:** Consider `m = 100000`: The program should ideally be able to find if there are any numbers that could yield this many trailing zeroes. However, the program has a fixed boundary which might not account for all potential values.

In conclusion, while the program handles specified cases well, it may incorrectly handle situations where `m` is very high (e.g., `m = 100000`) if the range of `high` is insufficient. 

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle all potential edge cases correctly, particularly when extreme values of `m` are provided.
