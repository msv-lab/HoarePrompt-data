Functionality: ** The function accepts four integers: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, where `n` represents the total number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos` is the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l` is the left index of a segment to keep open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and `r` is the right index of the same segment. It calculates the number of tabs that need to be closed based on the cursor's position relative to the specified segment `[l, r]`. Specifically, if the cursor is outside the segment, it adds to the count the distance to the nearest boundary of the segment. Additionally, it accounts for tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r`, ensuring that any adjustments are made based on the cursor's position, and prints the total number of tabs to close. **
