The code snippet `print(0)` outputs the value `0`, but does not change any variable values. The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions with the addition of the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; the current value of `l` is 1 and the current value of `r` is equal to `n`; printed output is 0.**
