The variable `move_to_r` is assigned the value `abs(pos - r)`. Given that `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, the value of `move_to_r` will be the absolute difference between `pos` and `r`. 

The previous values of the affected variables remain valid, and only the new value of `move_to_r` is computed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is not equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`.**
