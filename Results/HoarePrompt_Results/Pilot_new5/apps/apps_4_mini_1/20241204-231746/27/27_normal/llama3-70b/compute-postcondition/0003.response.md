The value of `a3` is assigned the result of `(x ** y) ** z`, which can also be expressed as `x ** (y * z)` based on the properties of exponents. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0, `a3` will also be a positive real number. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `x ** (y * z)`.**
