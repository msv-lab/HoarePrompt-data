The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It works with three defined variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0], each having exactly one digit after the decimal point. The output of the function is not specified. Therefore, we can conclude that the function does not have a specific return value based on the provided information.
