To evaluate the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, let's first analyze the code and its behavior.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function `func_1(n)` checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2 and returns 'NO' if it is. This is consistent with the problem description since `n` must be at least 2.
2. It calculates the divisors of `n` in the specified range (from 2 to the square root of `n`), which is appropriate since the problem states that `b_i` must be greater than 1 and less than `n`.
3. If no divisors are found, it returns 'NO'. However, if `n` is prime, it should also return 'NO' since prime numbers don't have divisors in the specified range.
4. If divisors are found, it constructs a list of fractions (1, d) where d is each divisor found, and returns 'YES' along with the count of these fractions and the fractions themselves.

### Edge Cases:
- If `n` is a prime number:
    - The code correctly identifies this scenario because it will not find any divisors and will return 'NO'.
- If `n = 4`:
    - The divisors are valid (2). The output will be 'YES', but it will only return one fraction (1, 2) which is valid as long as the sum of fractions matches the requirement (which it does since 1/2 does equal 1 - 1/4).
- If `n` is a perfect square (e.g., 9), it should return 'YES' and include both divisors (3 and 3), resulting in the representation of fractions that satisfy the sum condition.
  
### Output Hints Analysis:
The hints indicate:
- The function returns 'NO' if `n` has no unique divisors other than 1 and `n`, which is correct.
- The hints suggest that it does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is prime or edge cases like `n = 4` with only one divisor. However, the code does handle these cases correctly, as explained earlier.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to meet the requirements described in the problem statement for various cases, including edge cases of prime numbers and specific composite numbers like 4. There is no circumstance under which the code would fail to deliver correct output based on the analysis.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly identifies if a sequence of fractions can be formed under the given constraints for all specified cases.
