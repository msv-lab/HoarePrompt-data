The function accepts a positive integer `n`, returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2, returns 'NO' if `n` has no unique divisors other than 1 and `n`, and returns 'YES' along with the count and list of unique divisors otherwise. It does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is prime or edge cases like `n = 4` with only one divisor.
