The `print('1', n)` statement outputs '1' followed by the value of `n`. The state of the variables does not change with this code, but the printed output is specified. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still within the range of 2 to \(10^9\) and not equal to 2. The variable `k` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is not equal to 2; `k` is 2; printed output is '1' followed by the value of `n`.**
