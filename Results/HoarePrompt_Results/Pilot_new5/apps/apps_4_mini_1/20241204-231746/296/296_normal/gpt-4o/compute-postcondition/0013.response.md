The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 9, and `i` is 3. The code executes `divisors.append(n // i)`, which calculates `n // i` (integer division of `n` by `i`) and appends the result to the list `divisors`. 

Since `i` is 3, the operation `n // i` will result in a value that depends on `n`. Given that `n` must be at least 9, the minimum possible value of `n // i` is `9 // 3`, which equals 3. Therefore, the value appended to `divisors` could be 3 or greater, depending on the actual value of `n`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, and `divisors` now includes the value resulting from `n // 3`, which is at least 3.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `divisors` now includes the value at least `n // 3`.**
