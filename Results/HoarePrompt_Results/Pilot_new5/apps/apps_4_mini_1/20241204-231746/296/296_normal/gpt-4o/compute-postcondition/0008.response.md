`divisors` is updated to include the value of `n // i`, which represents the integer division of `n` by `i`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `i` is equal to 2, the result of `n // i` will be a positive integer equal to `n` divided by 2. Therefore, `divisors` will now include this new element.

The previous state of the variables is:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2
- `divisors` is [2]
- `i` is 2

Now, let's analyze the changes:
- `divisors` will now be updated to include the new value `n // i`, which will be appended to the list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is [2, n // 2]; `i` is 2**
