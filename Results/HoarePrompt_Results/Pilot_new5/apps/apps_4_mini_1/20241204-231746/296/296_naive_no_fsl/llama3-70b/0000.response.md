To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the code against the problem description and consider various input cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to find a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) such that:
  1. \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \)
  2. \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \)
  3. The sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \)

### Analyzing the Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)
```

1. **When \( n = 2 \)**: The program correctly outputs "NO". This is correct since there are no valid values for \( b_i \) (as \( b_i \) must be between 1 and \( n \)).
  
2. **When \( n > 2 \)**: The program outputs "YES" and always provides \( k = 2 \) with fractions \( \frac{1}{n//2} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \). 
   - Here, \( b_1 = n // 2 \) and \( b_2 = n \). 
   - \( b_1 \) should meet the conditions of being a divisor of \( n \) and being between 1 and \( n \). However, \( b_2 = n \) violates the requirement of \( 1 < b_i < n \).

### Failure Case:
Letâ€™s consider \( n = 4 \):
- The program would output:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 2
  1 4
  ```
  - Here, \( b_1 = 2 \) is valid, but \( b_2 = 4 \) is invalid since it does not satisfy \( 1 < b_i < n \).
  
Thus, the logic used does not correctly provide valid values for \( b_i \) when \( n \) is greater than 2, resulting in a case where the output does not correspond to the requirements of the problem statement.

### Correctness Conclusion:
Correctness: **False** 

The program does not handle the case for valid \( b_i \) correctly when \( n > 2 \). Specifically, it incorrectly includes \( n \) as a valid denominator, which violates the requirement of \( 1 < b_i < n \).
