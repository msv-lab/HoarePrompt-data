The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` based on the value of `dp[j - 1]`. Since `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` and `dp[0]` is set to 1, the previous values of `dp[j]` will change depending on the value of `j`, which isn't specified in the initial state but is assumed to be within the bounds of the list. The value of `dp[j]` will now include the value of `dp[j - 1]`.

The states of the other variables, `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, and `i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` set to 1, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` for unspecified `j`.**
