`dp[j]` is updated to be `dp[j] % MOD`. Since `MOD` is 1000000007, this operation ensures that `dp[j]` remains within the bounds of `MOD`. The other variables including `n`, `f_max_n`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 2; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1; `dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n, `dp[j]` has been updated; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1; `dp[j]` is now `dp[j]` modulo 1000000007.**
