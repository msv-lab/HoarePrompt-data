To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `f_max_n` down to `1`. The current value of `j` at the end of the last iteration is `f_max_n`.
2. In the next iteration, `j` would be decremented by `1`. Thus, `j` will become `f_max_n - 1`.
3. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be greater than `0`. Given that `f_max_n` is at least `1`, `f_max_n - 1` is guaranteed to be valid as long as `f_max_n >= 1`.

Since the loop has executed with `j` equal to `f_max_n`, it will continue to execute for `j` equal to `f_max_n - 1`. The other states remain unchanged as they don't specifically relate to the loop's termination condition.

State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j]` + `dp[j - 1]` modulo `1000000007`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is now equal to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
