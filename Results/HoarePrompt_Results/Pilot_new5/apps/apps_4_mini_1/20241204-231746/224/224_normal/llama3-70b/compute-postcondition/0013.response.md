Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`; `dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to the sum of its original value and `dp[j - 1]`, followed by taking modulo `1000000007`.**
