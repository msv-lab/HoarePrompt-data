The value of `dp[j]` is updated to be the result of `dp[j] % MOD`. Since `dp[j]` was already updated to `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]) % 1000000007`, applying the modulus operation will ensure that `dp[j]` remains within the bounds of `MOD`. However, the operation does not change the value of `dp[j]` because it is already modulo `MOD`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is in the range 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, and `dp[j]` is equal to `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]) % 1000000007`.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`; `dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`; `i` is 2; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` remains equal to `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]) % 1000000007`.**
