The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, we can express this update as `dp[f_max_n - 2] += dp[f_max_n - 3]`. The value of `dp[j]` (which is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`) is modified, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 2; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1; `dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n, `dp[j]` has been updated; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 2; `dp[j]` is now `dp[j]` modulo 1000000007; `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]`.**
