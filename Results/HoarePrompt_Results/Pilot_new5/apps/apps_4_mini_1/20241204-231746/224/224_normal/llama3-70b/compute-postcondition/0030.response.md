The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. The variable `j` is defined to be equal to `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is then updated accordingly.

Before the execution of the code, we have the following:
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- Each `dp[j]` from `1` to `f_max_n` has previously been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` modulo `1000000007`.
- The specific value of `dp[j]` after these updates is not known, but it is valid for the index `j = f_max_n - 1`.

After executing `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]`, the value of `dp[j]` will change, and we will denote the updated value as:
- `dp[j]` will now be equal to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, which is still taken modulo `1000000007`.

Therefore, the output state reflects these changes, incorporating the new value of `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j]` + `dp[j - 1]` modulo `1000000007`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is now equal to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1] % MOD`.**
