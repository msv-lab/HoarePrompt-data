According to the code, the for loop iterates from 1 to `n`, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be equal to `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration. 

Given that `n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6, if at the end of the last iteration `i` is `n + 1`, then `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again, the only condition that needs to be satisfied is that `n` must remain the same, as it does not change during the iterations, and `i` must now be set to `1`.

State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`; `dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to the sum of its original value and `dp[j - 1]`, followed by taking modulo `1000000007`; `i` is 1**
