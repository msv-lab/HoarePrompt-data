The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `f_max_n`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be in the range from 2 to \(10^6\), and `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations of integers from 1 through `n`. After executing the function body, the function returns the value of `dp[f_max_n]`, where `dp[j]` is defined as the sum of all previous `dp[k]` for `k` ranging from 0 to `j-1`, taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and a non-negative integer `f_max_n`, and return the calculated value from the `dp` array based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n (an integer in the range 2 to 10^6) and f_max_n (a non-negative integer), and returns dp[f_max_n], where dp[j] is the sum of all previous dp[k] for k from 0 to j-1, modulo 1000000007.**
