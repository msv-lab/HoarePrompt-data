The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and iterates through all integers from 1 to `n`, calling the function `func_1` with the current maximum result and the current integer `i`. It returns the maximum value obtained from these calls to `func_1`. The function does not handle any potential errors or edge cases that may arise from the execution of `func_1`.
