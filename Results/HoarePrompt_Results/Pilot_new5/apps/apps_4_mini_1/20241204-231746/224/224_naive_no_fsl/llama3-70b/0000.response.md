To analyze the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to evaluate the key components of the code and check their alignment with the requirements.

1. **Understanding the Function `f(p)`**:
   - The function `f(p)` is defined as the number of distinct GCD values obtained from prefixes of the permutation `p`.
   - The maximum value of this function across all permutations of integers from 1 to `n` is represented as `f_max(n)`.

2. **Implementation in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2(n)` attempts to compute the maximum value of `f(p)` by calculating GCDs of the numbers from 1 to `n`. However, the implementation is incorrect. It does not correctly compute `f_max(n)`, as it merely computes a single GCD value rather than determining the distinct GCDs from all possible prefixes.

3. **Counting Valid Permutations in `func_3`**:
   - The function `func_3(n, f_max_n)` is tasked with counting the permutations that yield `f(p) = f_max(n)`. It uses a dynamic programming approach, but since `f_max_n` is incorrectly computed (as discussed in the previous point), the output from `func_3` will also be incorrect.

4. **Example Testing**:
   - For `n = 2`, the only permutation is `[1, 2]`, yielding `f(p) = 1`, which matches the expected output. This situation does not expose any flaws in the code.
   - For `n = 3`, examining the GCDs for each permutation shows that `f_max(3) = 2`, which means the code must yield an output of `4`. However, due to the incorrect calculation of `f_max(n)` in `func_2`, this may not hold true.

5. **Key Issue**:
   - The main issue arises from the flawed `func_2` implementation. The logic should compute the number of distinct GCDs from all prefixes, but it doesn't. This will lead to an incorrect `f_max(n)` value and subsequently an incorrect count of valid permutations.

Given this analysis, it is clear that the code does not satisfy the problem requirements due to the incorrect computation of `f_max(n)`.

Correctness: **False**
