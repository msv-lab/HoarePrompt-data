The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`. This means that `current_sum` is now equal to `0`, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `ticket`, `segment_length`, `target_sum`, `segment_count`, and `i` are still valid and unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is equal to the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of segments found that match `target_sum`, and `i` is equal to `n - 1.**
