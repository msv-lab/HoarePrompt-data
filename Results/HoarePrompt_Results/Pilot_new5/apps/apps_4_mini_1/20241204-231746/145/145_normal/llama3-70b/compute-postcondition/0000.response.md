The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value obtained from the `sum` function applied to `ticket`. Since `ticket` is a string of digits, the `sum` function will calculate the total of its digits. The exact value of `total_sum` will depend on the specific digits in `ticket`, but it will be a non-negative integer. The length of `ticket` is between 2 and 100, and each digit is between 0 and 9 inclusive.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits of length n (2 <= n <= 100), where each digit is between 0 and 9 inclusive; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` which is a non-negative integer.**
