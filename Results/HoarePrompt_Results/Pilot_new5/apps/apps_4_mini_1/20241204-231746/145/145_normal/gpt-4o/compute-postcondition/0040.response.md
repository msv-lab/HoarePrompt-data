The value of `current_sum` is incremented by `int(ticket[i])`, where `i` is currently 2. The variable `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, so `ticket[i]` will be the digit at index 2. The value of `current_sum` is affected, but other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `current_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 2, if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is 2, `current_sum` is updated by adding `int(ticket[2])`.**
