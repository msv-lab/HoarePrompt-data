Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`. If `curr_sum` is equal to `target_sum`, `curr_sum` is updated to `curr_sum + digit` and `segments` is incremented by 1. If `curr_sum` is not equal to `target_sum`, `curr_sum` remains unchanged and `segments` is unchanged as well.***
