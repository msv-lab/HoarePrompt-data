The value of `current_sum` is updated by adding the integer value of the `ticket` string at index `i`, which is 2. The value of `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, and we do not know the specific digit at index 2. Therefore, `current_sum` becomes `current_sum + int(ticket[2])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is equal to `current_sum + int(ticket[2])`, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is increased by 1, `i` is 2**.
