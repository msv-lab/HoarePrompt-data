Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits of length n (2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` that were processed, and `segments` is the number of times `curr_sum` reached `target_sum` during the loop execution. If `curr_sum` reached `target_sum`, it was reset to 0 for each segment found.**
