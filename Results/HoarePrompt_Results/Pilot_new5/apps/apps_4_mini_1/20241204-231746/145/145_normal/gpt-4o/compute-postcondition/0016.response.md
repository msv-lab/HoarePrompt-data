The variable `current_sum` is incremented by the integer value of the digit at index `i` of the string `ticket`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `current_sum` will be `0 + int(ticket[2])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is equal to `int(ticket[2])`, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is 2**
