The variables `m`, `a`, and `b` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The initial state specifies that `m` is a positive integer within the range from 1 to \(10^9\), and both `a` and `b` are positive integers within the range from 1 to \(10^5\). After executing the code, they are reassigned based on the user input. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `b` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5; `m`, `a`, `b` are new input integers.**
