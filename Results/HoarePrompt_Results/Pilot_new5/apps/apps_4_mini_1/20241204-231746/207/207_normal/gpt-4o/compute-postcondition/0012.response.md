Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. It first calculates a value `g` from `func_1(a, b)`. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with `m` divided by `g`, `a` divided by `g`, and `b` divided by `g`, then multiplies the result by `g`. If `m` is less than `k` (where `k` is `a + b - 1`), it returns the sum of the first `m` integers. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it returns the sum of the first `k` integers plus the adjusted sum of the first `m` integers minus the sum of the first `k - 1` integers. The function handles various cases based on the relationships between `m`, `a`, and `b`, and performs calculations accordingly. **
