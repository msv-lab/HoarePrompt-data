Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters from user input. It then counts the number of distinct adjacent characters in the string `s` and prints this count. The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on user input for its data. If `n` is 1, the output will always be `1`, since a single character has no adjacent characters to compare. The function does not handle any errors related to input, such as invalid integer input or string length mismatches. **
