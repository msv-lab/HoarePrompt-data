The function `func` accepts an integer input `n` (where 1 <= n <= 500) and a string `s` of length `n`, which consists of lowercase Latin letters. It calculates the number of transitions between different characters in the string, counting each time the character changes from one to another while iterating through the string. The function initializes `operations` to 1 to account for the first character and increments it whenever a differing character is encountered in the string. Finally, it prints the total count of transitions, which may not accurately reflect the number of operations if the string consists of identical characters, as it would still return 1 in that case.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, and counts the number of transitions between different characters in `s`, printing the total operations counted. If the string has no transitions (all characters are the same), it still returns 1. **
