The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans`, which represents the number of distinct adjacent characters in the input string `s`. The initial state indicates that `s` is an input string of length `n`, and `ans` is already calculated based on that string. Therefore, after executing the print statement, the state of `s`, `n`, and `ans` remains unchanged, but we acknowledge that the value of `ans` has been printed.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of length `n`, `ans` is equal to the number of distinct adjacent characters in `s`, `n` is between 1 and 500, and the value of `ans` has been printed.**
