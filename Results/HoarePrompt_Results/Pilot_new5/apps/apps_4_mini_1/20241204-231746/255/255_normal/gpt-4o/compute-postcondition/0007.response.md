According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, meaning `i` can take values from 1 to at least 1. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

If `i` was 1 during the last iteration, then for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, leading to `i` being 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `operations` is 2 if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`, `i` is 2**
