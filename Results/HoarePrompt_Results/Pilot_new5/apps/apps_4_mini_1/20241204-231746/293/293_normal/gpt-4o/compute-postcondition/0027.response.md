Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `h` (between 1 and 50) and `n` (between 1 and 2^h), computes the binary representation of `n-1` as a path through a binary tree of height `h`, and counts the number of nodes visited along that path. It then prints the total number of visited nodes. The function does not handle any errors that could arise from invalid input, such as `n` being out of the specified range. **
