`total_leaves` is assigned the value of \(2^h\). Since `h` is an integer value between 1 and 50 inclusive, `total_leaves` will be a power of 2 ranging from \(2^1 = 2\) to \(2^{50} = 1125899906842624\). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`h` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 50 inclusive; `n` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 2^h inclusive; `total_leaves` is equal to \(2^h\).**
