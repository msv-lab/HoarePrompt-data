The variable `ans` is incremented by `n // 2`, where `//` denotes integer division. Given that `n` must be greater than 2, `n // 2` will yield a value of at least 1. The exact value of `ans` after this operation depends on its initial state, which is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` must be greater than 2; `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2` to its previous value.**
