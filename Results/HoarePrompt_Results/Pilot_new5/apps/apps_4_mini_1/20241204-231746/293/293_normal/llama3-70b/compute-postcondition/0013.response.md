After running the code `n //= 2`, the variable `n` is updated to its value divided by 2 using integer division. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 2, which means the possible values for `n` are 3 or higher. Consequently, after the division, `n` will be at least 1 (if n was initially 3) and at most 25 (if n was initially 50). 

The other variables `h` and `ans` remain unchanged in this operation, but we now know the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1 and can be one of the values from 1 to 25 depending on its initial value, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
