The variable `current_node` is assigned the value `2 * current_node + 2`. However, the initial value of `current_node` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value after the operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the update has taken place without specific values for `current_node`.

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string of length h, `direction` is the second character in the path, and `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 2`.**
