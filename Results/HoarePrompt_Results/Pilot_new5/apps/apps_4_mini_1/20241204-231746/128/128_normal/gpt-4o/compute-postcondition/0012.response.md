`total_sales` is assigned the value of the sum of `regular_sales`. The value of `regular_sales` is defined as `n` values, each equal to `min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`. Therefore, `total_sales` will represent the total of these minimum values calculated from the `days` list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` contains `n` values each equal to `min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` contains `n` values each equal to `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)`, `total_sales` is equal to the sum of `regular_sales`.**
