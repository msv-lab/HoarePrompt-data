Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list sorted in descending order based on the value of `l - k` for each tuple (k, l), and `sold` is printed, which is the total calculated from the first `f` elements using the formula `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` and the remaining `n-f` elements using `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`.**
