The variables `k` and `l` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input and converting them to integers. The values of `k` and `l` will be determined by the user input. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is an empty list, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**.
