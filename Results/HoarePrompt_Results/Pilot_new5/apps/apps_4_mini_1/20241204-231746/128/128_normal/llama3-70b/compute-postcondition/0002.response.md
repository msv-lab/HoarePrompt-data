According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times as long as `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is stated to be an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `f` does not affect the execution of the loop but can influence the loop's body if referenced there. The variable `days` is an empty list and will not impact the loop's ability to execute. 

Before the loop starts, we need to consider that the loop variable is commonly ignored (represented by `_`), which means we don't need to adjust any state specific to the loop variable itself. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments we must highlight are:
- `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, which is sufficient for the loop to execute.
- The variables `f` and `days` do not require any adjustments for the purpose of the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is an empty list**
