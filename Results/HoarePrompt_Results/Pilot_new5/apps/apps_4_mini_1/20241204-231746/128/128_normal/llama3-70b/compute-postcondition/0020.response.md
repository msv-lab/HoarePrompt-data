According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `f`, which means `i` has not yet reached `n` and is still valid for the next iteration. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. If `i` is currently less than `n`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`. 

Thus, we adjust the states as follows:
- `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `n` must remain a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list sorted in descending order based on the value of `l - k` for each tuple (k, l), `sold` remains updated, `i` is now `i + 1` and must be less than `n`**.
