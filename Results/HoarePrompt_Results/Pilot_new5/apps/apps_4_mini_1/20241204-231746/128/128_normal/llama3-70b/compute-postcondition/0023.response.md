Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, and `days` is a list sorted in descending order based on the value of `l - k` for each tuple (k, l). If `i` is less than `f`, `sold` is updated by adding `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`. Otherwise, `sold` is updated by adding `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`, and `i` remains less than `n`.***
