The code `days.append((k, l))` adds a new tuple `(k, l)` to the list `days`. The original state of the variables is not affected apart from the `days` list, which will now contain an additional tuple. The values of `k` and `l` are inputs, so they retain the values provided during input. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and `f` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list containing one tuple (k, l) and an additional tuple (k, l) has been appended to it.**
