The `queue` is being modified by appending `new_state_str`. The previous values of the affected variables are `visited`, which contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', and now includes `new_state_str`, and `current` is 'AXCB'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', and `new_state_str`; `current` is 'AXCB', `queue` now contains `new_state_str`**.
