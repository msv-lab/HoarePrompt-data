The `current` variable is assigned the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`, which removes and returns the leftmost item from the `queue`. The previous value of `queue` contained the `start` string, and after this operation, `queue` will be empty. The `current` variable will hold the value of `start`.

The `visited` set remains unchanged since there are no operations affecting it, and the other variables are also unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`.**
