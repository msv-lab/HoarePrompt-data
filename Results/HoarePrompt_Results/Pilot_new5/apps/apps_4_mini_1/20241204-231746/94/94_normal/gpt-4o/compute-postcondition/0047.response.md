To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we first need to evaluate the variables that will be impacted by the code snippet, which calculates `new_pos`.

1. The variables involved in the calculation are `new_row` and `new_col`. The values for these variables are not provided directly in the initial state, but we know that they are calculated based on the `empty_row` and `empty_col` variables along with the deltas `dr` and `dc`. However, since `dr` and `dc` are not specified in the initial state, the calculations for `new_row` and `new_col` remain undefined without their values.

2. The formula to compute `new_pos` is given as:
   ```
   new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
   ```
   Since we cannot calculate `new_row` and `new_col` due to the absence of specific values for `dr` and `dc`, we cannot determine a concrete value for `new_pos`.

Therefore, since the calculation of `new_pos` remains ambiguous due to missing definitions of `dr` and `dc`, we will state that the values of the variables remain unchanged, but we acknowledge that `new_pos` is intended to be defined, contingent upon specific values for `new_row` and `new_col`.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `start`, `queue` contains 'ABCX', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` and `new_col` are not defined, and `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
