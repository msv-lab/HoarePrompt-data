To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze how the program works in relation to the requirements.

1. **Input Processing:** The first part of the program reads two 2D grids (one for Bessie and one for Elsie) and constructs two strings, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, that represent the configuration of the sliding puzzles. The program ensures that both puzzles consist of the tiles 'A', 'B', 'C', and the empty cell 'X', which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Finding the Empty Cell:** The function `func_1` correctly identifies the position of the empty cell 'X' in both puzzles. This is crucial since the movement of tiles depends on their adjacency to the empty cell.

3. **Swapping and Comparing:** The program attempts to swap the positions of the tiles at the indices of 'X' in both puzzles. However, this is a key deviation from the requirements. The problem states that tiles can only be slid into the empty position if they are adjacent. The operation of swapping `puzzle1[x1]` and `puzzle2[x2]` does not guarantee that the tiles are adjacent before the swap. 

4. **Permutation Check:** After the swap, the program checks if the modified puzzles are permutations of each other. However, even if they are permutations, it does not ensure that it is possible to reach one configuration from the other through valid moves (i.e., sliding tiles). The mere act of sorting and comparing does not validate the ability to rearrange the tiles correctly according to the sliding rules.

5. **Failure Case:** For example, if `puzzle1` is:
   ```
   AB
   XC
   ```
   and `puzzle2` is:
   ```
   AC
   BX
   ```
   The empty cell 'X' is not adjacent to 'B' in `puzzle1`, so `B` cannot be slid into the empty cell, nor can `C` in `puzzle2` be slid to match `A` or `B`. The current logic would incorrectly allow this case when in reality, they cannot reach the same configuration through valid moves.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**
