The variable `new_state` is a list that contains values where the positions `1` and `new_pos` have been swapped. The code creates a string `new_state_str` by joining the elements of the list `new_state`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`.**
