The value of `x2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 4. The value of `puzzle1`, `puzzle2`, and `x1` remain unaffected since there is no condition affecting them in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists containing tiles 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `i` is 4; `x2` is 4.

Output State: **`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists containing tiles 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `i` is 4; `x2` is 4.**
