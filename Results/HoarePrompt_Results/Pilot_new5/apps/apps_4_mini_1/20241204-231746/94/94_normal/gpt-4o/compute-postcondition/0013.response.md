The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of the `new_state` list joined into a single string. The `new_state` list contains the elements ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'], which when joined will result in the string 'AXCB'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is 0; `new_col` is 1; `new_pos` is 1; `new_state` is a list ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B']; `new_state_str` is 'AXCB'.**
