`new_state_str` is appended to `queue`. The values of `start`, `visited`, and `current` remain unchanged, but `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str` as its new element.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, and `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.**
