`new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, where `new_state` is the list of characters created by swapping the characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `current` string. The value of `current` is still 'AXCB', and the values of `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remain unchanged. The values of `visited` and `queue` are also unaffected. 

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str`; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` remains the first element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 1; `empty_row` is 0; `empty_col` is 1; `new_state_str` is the string obtained by joining the characters of `new_state`.**
