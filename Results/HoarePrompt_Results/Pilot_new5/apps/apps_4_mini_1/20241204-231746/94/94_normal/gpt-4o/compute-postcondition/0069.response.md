`new_state` is assigned the value of a list created from the string `current`, which is 'AXCB'. Therefore, `new_state` will be the list `['A', 'X', 'C', 'B']`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B']**
