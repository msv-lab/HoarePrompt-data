`empty_pos` is assigned the value of the index of the character 'X' in the string `current`. Since `current` is equal to `start`, which is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', the index of 'X' in `start` is 3. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3.**
