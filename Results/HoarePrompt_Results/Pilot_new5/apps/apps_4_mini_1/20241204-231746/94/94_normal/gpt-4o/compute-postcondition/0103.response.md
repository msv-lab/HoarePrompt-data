To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over `directions`, which implies that each iteration provides a new pair `(dr, dc)`.
2. The state variables provided are:
   - `start` is 'AXCB'
   - `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements
   - `queue` contains new valid states not yet visited, with `new_state_str` added
   - `current` is the first element of the `queue`
   - `empty_pos` is 1
   - `empty_row` is 0
   - `empty_col` is 1

3. The important factor for adjusting the states is the number of elements in `directions`. If the loop has executed previously, we must consider which iteration it is on.

4. Given that the loop starts from the first element and iterates through each of the direction pairs, we need to increment the current index for it to proceed to the next pair of directions.

5. Assuming that the loop has executed before and we've processed at least one `(dr, dc)` pair, we need to determine the state after processing the last direction pair.

6. Thus, we need to:
   - Keep `start` unchanged.
   - Keep `visited` unchanged as it contains all previously visited states.
   - Adjust `current` to the next state in the queue.
   - The empty position and row/column remain the same unless a movement based on `(dr, dc)` is made.

Therefore, if there were `N` direction pairs in `directions`, and we assume we have processed the first `n` pairs, the adjustment will reflect that we are moving to the `n+1` pair.

As a result:

State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` is the next element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 1; `empty_row` is 0; `empty_col` is 1; if the `(n+1)`th pair `(dr, dc)` exists in the directions.**
