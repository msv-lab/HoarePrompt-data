Postcondition: ***`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and the previous elements; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` remains the first element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 1; `empty_row` is 0; `empty_col` is 1; `new_state_str` is the string obtained by joining the characters of `new_state`, if `new_state_str` was not previously visited.***
