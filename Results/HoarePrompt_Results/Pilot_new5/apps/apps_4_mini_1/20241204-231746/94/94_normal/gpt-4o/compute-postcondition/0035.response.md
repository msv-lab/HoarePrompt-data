The code executes the statement `visited.add(new_state_str)`, which adds the current value of `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. The value of `new_state_str` is derived from the concatenation of elements in `new_state`, but since `new_state` is a list with unknown values, we cannot determine the exact string being added to `visited`. However, we know that the previous values of `visited` are 'start', 'AXCB', and 'ABCX'. 

Since `new_state_str` is not defined yet, the output state will include the existing values of the variables and indicate that `new_state_str` has been added to `visited`.

Output State: **`start` is 'A', 'B', 'C', 'X'; `new_pos` is unknown; `new_state` is a list of `current` (value unknown); `new_state_str` is now added to `visited`; `visited` includes `start`, 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `new_state_str`; `queue` contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1.**
