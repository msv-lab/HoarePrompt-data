The code swaps the values at `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. Given that `empty_pos` is 3 and `new_pos` is 1, the swap will interchange the characters at those indices in the `new_state` list.

Initially, `new_state` is `['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']`. The character at index 3 is 'X' and the character at index 1 is 'B'.

After swapping:
- `new_state[3]` becomes 'B'
- `new_state[1]` becomes 'X'

Thus, the new state of `new_state` will be `['A', 'X', 'C', 'B']`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is 0; `new_col` is 1; `new_pos` is 1; `new_state` is a list ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'].**
