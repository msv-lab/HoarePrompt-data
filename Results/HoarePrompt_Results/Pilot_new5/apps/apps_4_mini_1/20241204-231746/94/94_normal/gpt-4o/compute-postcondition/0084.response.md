The code assigns `new_pos` the value calculated from `new_row` and `new_col` using the formula `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The value of `new_row` is equal to `dr`, and `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`. The initial state specifies that `new_row` is between 0 and 1 inclusive, and `new_col` is between 0 and 2 inclusive.

Given that `new_row` can be either 0 or 1 and `new_col` can be either 1 or 2 (since `dc` can be either 0 or 1), we can ascertain that:
- If `new_row = 0`, then `new_pos` can be `0 * 2 + 1 = 1` or `0 * 2 + 2 = 2`.
- If `new_row = 1`, then `new_pos` can be `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` or `1 * 2 + 2 = 4`.

Thus, the possible values for `new_pos` can be either 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on the specific values of `new_row` and `new_col`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state must reflect the conditions of the unchanged variables and the new value for `new_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, and `new_pos` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4.**
