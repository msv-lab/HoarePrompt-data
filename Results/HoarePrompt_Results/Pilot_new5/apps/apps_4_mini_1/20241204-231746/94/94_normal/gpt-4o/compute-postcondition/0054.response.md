Postcondition: ***`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and 'ACXB', `queue` contains 'ABCX' and 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `new_state` is ['A', 'C', 'X', 'B'], and `new_state_str` is 'ACXB'. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` is updated to include 'ACXB', and `queue` is updated to include 'ACXB'.***
