Postcondition: ***`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already present, the `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it. The value of `current` remains the first element of the `queue`, and the variables `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are 1, 0, and 1 respectively. If `new_state_str` was already in `visited`, then the state remains unchanged.***
