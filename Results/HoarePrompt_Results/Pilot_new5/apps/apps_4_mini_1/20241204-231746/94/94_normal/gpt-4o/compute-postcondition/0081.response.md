According to the code, the execution of the loop relies on the `directions` variable. The loop will iterate over the `directions` if it is not empty. Given the initial state, we need to ensure that the `directions` variable is defined and contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Considering that the `start` state is 'AXCB', the `visited` variable is populated with all unique states generated from 'AXCB', the `queue` is defined with new valid states, `current` is the first element in `queue`, and we have the position of the empty space defined by `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `directions` must be populated.

State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must contain at least 1 element**
