To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the variables and the impact of the code on them.

Initial State:
- `start` is 'AXCB'
- `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB'
- `current` is 'AXCB'
- `empty_pos` must be updated based on a valid move
- The code snippet updates `new_row` and `new_col` based on the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`, which are not provided in the initial state.

Since `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine specific values for `new_row` and `new_col`. However, we can state that they are dependent on the combination of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`.

Thus, the output state remains consistent with the unchanged variables and reflects the updating of `new_row` and `new_col`.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.**
