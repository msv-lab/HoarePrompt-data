The `visited` variable is assigned a set containing the `start` string. The previous value of `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. The `queue` variable remains unchanged as the code only affects the `visited` variable. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`.**
