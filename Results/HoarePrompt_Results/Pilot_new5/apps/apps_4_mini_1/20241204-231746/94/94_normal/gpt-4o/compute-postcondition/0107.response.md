The code snippet swaps the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. The variables that change are `new_state` and the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. 

Given the initial position of `empty_pos` is 1 and `new_pos` is calculated as `2 * dr + 1 + dc`, we assume `dr` and `dc` have specific values that yield a valid integer for `new_pos` (which should also be within bounds of the list). 

When the swap occurs:
- `new_state[empty_pos]` takes the value of `new_state[new_pos]`
- `new_state[new_pos]` takes the value of `new_state[empty_pos]`

Since we do not have the specific values of `dr` and `dc`, we cannot compute `new_pos` directly, but we can update the output state based on the operations performed.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` is the next element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 2; `new_state` is a list created from `current` with the values at indices `1` and `new_pos` swapped.**
