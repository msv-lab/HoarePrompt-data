According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `queue`. The loop can execute as long as `queue` is not empty. Right before the loop, `queue` contains `start`, which means `queue` is not empty, so the loop can execute.

Since `queue` is populated with `start` and it is already non-empty, there are no additional adjustments required for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
