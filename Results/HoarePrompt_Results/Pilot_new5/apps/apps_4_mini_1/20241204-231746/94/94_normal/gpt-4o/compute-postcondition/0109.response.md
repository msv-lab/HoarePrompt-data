The code snippet `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. The other variables remain unchanged, so their previous values are still valid. Since `new_state_str` is part of the input state, we will output that `new_state_str` has been added to `visited`.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements plus `new_state_str`; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` is the next element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 2; `new_state_str` is the result of joining `new_state`.**
