According to the code, the loop iterates over the `directions`, which suggests that `directions` is a collection of tuples representing changes in row and column positions. The loop will execute once for each tuple in `directions`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are already set to 1, 0, and 1 respectively, and the `current` variable is pointing to the first element of the `queue`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the next (`dr`, `dc`) pair from the `directions`. If the loop has already iterated through all available directions, then it won't execute again.

Assuming the loop has not yet iterated through all the tuples in `directions`, the next pair would need to be considered. However, without the specific structure or length of `directions`, we can only clarify the existing variables.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remain the same, and we will assume that the loop will iterate over the next tuple in `directions`.

State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already present, `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it, `current` remains the first element of the `queue`, and `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are 1, 0, and 1 respectively, and `directions` must have more tuples to allow another iteration.**
