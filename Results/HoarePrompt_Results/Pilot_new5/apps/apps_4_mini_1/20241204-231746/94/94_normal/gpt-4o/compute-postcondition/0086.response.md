In the provided code snippet, `new_state` is a list created from `current`, and the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are being swapped. 

Let's analyze the variables:
- `empty_pos` is 1, which means `new_state[1]` is the element currently in position 1 of the list.
- `new_pos` can be either 1, 2, 3, or 4, representing another position in the list.

Since `new_state` is derived from `current`, the values in `new_state` before the swap will allow us to determine the new values after the swap occurs. Each state in the list will be swapped based on `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.

Therefore:
- The value at `new_state[empty_pos]` (which is `new_state[1]`) will be replaced with the value at `new_state[new_pos]`.
- The value at `new_state[new_pos]` will be replaced with the value at `new_state[empty_pos]`.

This results in the following changes:
- `new_state[1]` will take the value of `new_state[new_pos]`.
- `new_state[new_pos]` will take the value of `new_state[1]`.

The states of `start`, `visited`, `queue`, `current`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_state` has the values at positions `1` and `new_pos` swapped.**
