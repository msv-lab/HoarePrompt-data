The variable `new_state` initially is `['A', 'X', 'C', 'B']`, with `empty_pos` being `1`. The values of `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc` are not provided, so we cannot determine `new_row`, `new_col`, or `new_pos`. However, what we do know is that the code snippet swaps the elements in `new_state` located at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. 

Considering the swap, `new_state[1]` would be changed to the value that was at `new_state[new_pos]`, and `new_state[new_pos]` would be changed to the value that was at `new_state[1]`. Since `new_pos` cannot be determined without the values of `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`, we can only indicate that a swap occurs.

Thus, the output state retains all previous information, but acknowledges the swap operation, while not specifying the exact values due to the unknown `new_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `new_state` has swapped values at positions 1 and `new_pos`, `new_state_str` is 'ACXB', `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**
