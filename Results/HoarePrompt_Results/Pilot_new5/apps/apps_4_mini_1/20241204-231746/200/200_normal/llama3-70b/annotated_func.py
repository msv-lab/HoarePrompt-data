#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), s is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), and v is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ v[i] ≤ 10^9) representing the volume of kvass in each keg.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, which implies that the loop has terminated when `low` reached the final value that satisfies the condition. The final value of `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, it indicates that the original minimum value of `v` was insufficient to reach `s`, and if `total` is greater than or equal to `s`, it indicates that the loop terminated with `low` being the maximum value that meets the condition. The final values of `low` and `high` are equal, and `mid` is the average of the final `low` and `high` values in the last iteration. `v` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is the input positive integer, and `s` is the input positive integer.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`low` is equal to `high`, and `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. If `total` is not equal to `s`, the output is -1 and `mid` is the average of the final values of `low` and `high`. If `total` is equal to `s`, the value of `low` is printed, indicating that the original minimum value of `v` was sufficient to reach `s`. The final values of `low` and `high` are equal, and `v` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is the input positive integer, and `s` is the input positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the target volume), along with a list `v` of `n` positive integers representing the kvass volume in each keg. It determines the maximum volume `low` that can be uniformly distributed among the kegs to achieve the total volume `s`. If such a distribution is not possible, it returns -1; otherwise, it outputs the value of `low`. The function also handles cases where the total kvass volume is less than `s` by ensuring that the output is -1 if the conditions are not met.
