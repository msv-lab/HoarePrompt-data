Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `v` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers from that input, and `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, then no further changes are made to the variables. If `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `min_keg_volume` is updated to equal `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` (if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0), `remaining_kvass` remains greater than 0 while `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `min_keg_volume` is printed.***
