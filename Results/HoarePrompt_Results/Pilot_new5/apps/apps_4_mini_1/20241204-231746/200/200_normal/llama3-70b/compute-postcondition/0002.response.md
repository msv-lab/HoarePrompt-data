The list `v` is sorted in ascending order. The previous state indicates that `v` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is a positive integer input. After sorting, `v` will now contain the same integers but in sorted order. Therefore, the output state reflects that `v` is now sorted while retaining the information regarding `n` and `s`.

Output State: **`v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer**.
