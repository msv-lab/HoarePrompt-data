Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, and `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. If `total` is not equal to `s`, the output is -1 and `mid` is the average of the final values of `low` and `high`. If `total` is equal to `s`, the value of `low` is printed, indicating that the original minimum value of `v` was sufficient to reach `s`. The final values of `low` and `high` are equal, and `v` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is the input positive integer, and `s` is the input positive integer.***
