Postcondition: ***`v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is set to `(min(v) + 1) // 2`, `high` is the minimum value of `v`, `mid` remains equal to `(min(v) + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` such that `total < s`. Otherwise, `low` is set to 0, `high` is adjusted to `(min(v) + 1) // 2 - 1`, `mid` remains equal to `(min(v) + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` where `total` is greater than or equal to `s.`***
