The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and `v`. 

- `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, representing the number of kegs.
- `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^{12}\), representing the total desired volume of kvass.
- `v` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer \(v[i]\) (for \(1 \leq i \leq n\)) is within the range of 1 to \(10^{9}\), representing the volume of kvass in each keg.

After executing the function body, the function returns the maximum number of kegs that can be filled without exceeding the total desired volume `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `s`, and a list of `n` positive integers `v`, and returns the maximum number of kegs that can be filled without exceeding the total desired volume `s`.**
