`arr` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`, which takes a space-separated string of integers as input and converts each to an integer. The variable `n` remains the same, but the list `a` is replaced by `arr`, which is now populated with integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers given as input.**
