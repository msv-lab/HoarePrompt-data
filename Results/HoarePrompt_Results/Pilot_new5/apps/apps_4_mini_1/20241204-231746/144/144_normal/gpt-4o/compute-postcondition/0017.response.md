Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It calculates the smallest positive integer (mex) that is not present in the list `a`. After processing the inputs, it returns the value of `mex`, which can range from 1 to `n + 1`, depending on whether all integers from 1 to `n` are in the list. If all integers from 1 to `n` are present, it returns `n + 1`. **
