The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mex` is 1, and `num` is greater than `mex`.
