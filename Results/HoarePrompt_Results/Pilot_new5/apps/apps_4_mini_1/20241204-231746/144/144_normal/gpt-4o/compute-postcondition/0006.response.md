The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. Since `mex` initially is 1, after the increment, `mex` will be 2. The values of the other variables `n`, `a`, and `num` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `mex`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mex` is 2, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`.**
