The provided program attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible value of the mex (minimum excluded value) after potentially modifying an input array. Let's analyze how the program aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input:** An array of positive integers.
2. **Operations:** You can decrease any element in the array to any smaller positive integer.
3. **Output:** The maximum possible value of mex of the modified array.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- It sorts the array `a` to facilitate finding the mex easily.
- It initializes `mex` to 1.
- The program then iterates through each number in the sorted array:
  - If the number is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments `mex`.
- Finally, it prints the computed `mex`.

### Verification of Correctness:
1. **Sorted Array:** By sorting the array, the program ensures that it examines the integers in increasing order, which is crucial for correctly determining the mex.
2. **Mex Calculation:** The loop checks each number in the sorted array:
   - If `num >= mex`, this means that the current `mex` value can be represented by an element in the array (i.e., it can be achieved by decrementing larger elements). Thus, `mex` is incremented to check for the next positive integer.
   - This process continues until either all elements have been processed or it finds a number that is less than `mex`, indicating that the current `mex` cannot be achieved with the given numbers.
3. **Handling Decreases:** Based on the problem, since you can decrease any element to any smaller positive integer, the approach of incrementing `mex` whenever a sufficient number is found ensures that the program is effectively considering all possible modifications.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description by accurately calculating the maximum possible mex value for the input array based on the described operations.

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
