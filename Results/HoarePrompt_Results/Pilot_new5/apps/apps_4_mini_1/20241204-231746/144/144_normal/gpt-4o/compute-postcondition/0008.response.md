According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more elements in the list `a`. The variable `num` is assigned the next element from `a` with each iteration. The loop continues until all elements in `a` have been processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `mex` is 2, and `num` is the first element in the list `a`. Since `num` is the first element and the loop iterates through each element in `a`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be updated to the next element in the sorted list `a`. 

If `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, then after the last iteration, `num` will now refer to the second element of the list if `n` is greater than 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the second element in the list `a`, and we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 1 for there to be more elements to iterate over.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mex` is 2, `num` is the second element in the list `a` if `n` is greater than 1**.
