Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 3 elements; `num` is the third element of `arr`. If `num` equals `mex`, `mex` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `num` is greater than `mex`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
