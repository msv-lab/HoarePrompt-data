The variable `mex` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of the input list (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of n positive integers in non-decreasing order where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9, and `mex` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the input list (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of n positive integers in non-decreasing order where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9, `mex` is 1**.
