The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. Since `n` is initially defined as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, after this assignment, `n` will still satisfy that condition, but its value will change to whatever integer is provided by the user input. The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 (updated to user input), `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9.**
