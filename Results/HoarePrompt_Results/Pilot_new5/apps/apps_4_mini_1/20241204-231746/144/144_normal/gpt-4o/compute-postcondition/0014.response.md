Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, and if `mex` reaches a value greater than `n`, then it will be `n + 1` (indicating all integers from 1 to `n` are present in the list).**
