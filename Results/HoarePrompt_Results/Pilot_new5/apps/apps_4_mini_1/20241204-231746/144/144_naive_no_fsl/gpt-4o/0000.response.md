To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic step by step:

1. The program reads two inputs: the number of elements `n` and an array `a` of positive integers.
2. It sorts the array `a`.
3. It initializes a variable `mex` to 1.
4. It iterates over each number in the sorted array:
   - If the current number is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `mex`.

The goal is to find the maximum possible value of `mex` for an array that can be modified under the constraints provided (i.e., any number can be decreased to any positive integer that is less than its current value).

### Analysis of the Code Logic

- The code correctly identifies that the smallest positive integer not present in the array can be incremented every time a number in the array is greater than or equal to `mex`.
- By sorting the array, it ensures that it checks the smallest numbers first, which is vital in determining the mex effectively.
  
### Edge Cases

1. **Single Element Array**: 
   - Input: `1` and `1`. The output should be `2` because the only number is `1`, and `mex` would be the next missing integer which is `2`.
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.

2. **All Elements Are the Same**:
   - Input: `3` and `5 5 5`. The output should be `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, since we can only get down to `1`, but `6` is missing.
   - The program outputs `6`, which is incorrect.

3. **Array with Large Values**:
   - Input: `5` and `1 2 3 4 1000000000`. The output should be `5`, as we can maintain the first four numbers and decrease `1000000000` to any number below `5`.
   - The program correctly outputs `5`.

### Conclusion

The program fails on the edge case where all elements are the same and larger than `1`. In this case, it does not correctly account for the possibility of using lower numbers to achieve a higher mex. Thus, the logic does not hold for every input, leading to an incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**. 

This conclusion comes from identifying that the code does not handle the scenario where all elements are the same correctly.
