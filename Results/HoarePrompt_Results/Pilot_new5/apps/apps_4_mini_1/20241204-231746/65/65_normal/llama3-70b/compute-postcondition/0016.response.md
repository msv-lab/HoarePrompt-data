Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is updated as needed, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. If `c` is already in `color_count`, then `color_count[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is not in `color_count`, then `c` is added as a key with a value of 1. No further characters are processed in the loop.***
