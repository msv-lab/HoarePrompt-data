Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string of lowercase letters with length `n`, and `color` is the first character of `s`. If `color` is already a key in `color_count`, its value is increased by 1. Otherwise, `color_count` will have `color` as a key with a value of 1.***
