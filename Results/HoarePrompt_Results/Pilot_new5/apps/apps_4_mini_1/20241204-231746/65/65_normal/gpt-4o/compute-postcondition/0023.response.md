Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string of lowercase letters of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, and `count` can be any value from `color_count.values()`. If `count` is greater than `k`, then `can_distribute` is set to `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
