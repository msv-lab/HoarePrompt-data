You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500); `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)); `edges` must contain `m` edges; `graph` is a defaultdict(list) containing directed edges as per the tuples in `edges`. For each edge (u, v) in `edges`, `v` is appended to `graph[u]`, creating a representation of the directed graph.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES', indicating a successful outcome based on the directed graph represented by 'graph' which is built from the provided edges, with no cycles present in the graph.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500); `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)); `edges` must contain `m` edges; `graph` is a defaultdict(list) containing directed edges as per the tuples in `edges`. For each edge (u, v) in `edges`, `v` is appended to `graph[u]`, creating a representation of the directed graph. The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` contains `m` edges, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) representing the edges after all edges have been processed, and the graph still contains at least one cycle.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that the graph contains at least one cycle
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices, an integer `m` representing the number of directed edges, and a list of tuples `edges` that represent the directed edges in a graph. It constructs a directed graph and checks for cycles. If the graph is acyclic at the initial state or after removing any single edge, it returns 'YES'. If all checks indicate that the graph contains at least one cycle, the function returns 'NO'. The function does not handle the case where `edges` is empty or when `m` is less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Therefore, it assumes valid input according to the constraints provided.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from those vertices; n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, with the condition that n is at least 2.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices in the graph, where each value corresponds to the number of incoming edges for each vertex, and `n` is the total number of vertices in the graph. If the graph is empty (i.e., has no keys), the `in_degree` will remain as initialized, with each vertex having an in-degree of 0.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing all reachable vertices from the original nodes in `queue`; `queue` is empty, indicating that all vertices with in-degrees of 0 have been processed; `n` remains the total number of vertices; `count` reflects the total number of vertices that have been processed from `queue`.
    return count != n
    #The program returns whether the total number of vertices processed from queue is not equal to the total number of vertices, indicating whether all vertices have been processed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph with integer keys as vertices and lists of integers as directed edges. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the graph contains a cycle; specifically, it returns True if there is a cycle (not all vertices can be processed due to unprocessed vertices), and False if the graph is acyclic (all vertices can be processed). The function assumes that `n` (the number of vertices) is at least 2, but it does not handle cases where vertices have no edges, which may lead to misleading results in the context of cycle detection.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
