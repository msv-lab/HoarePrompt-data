The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `in_degree[v]` exists, and since `v` is the second value in the list associated with the key `u` of `graph`, this increment will affect `in_degree[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 1 key, `n` must be greater than 0, `u` is the first key in the graph, `graph[u]` must have at least 2 values, `v` is the second value in the list associated with key `u`, and `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.**
