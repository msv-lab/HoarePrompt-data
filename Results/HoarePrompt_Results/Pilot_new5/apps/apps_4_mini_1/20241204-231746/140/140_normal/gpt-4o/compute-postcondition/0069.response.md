Postcondition: ***`in_degree` contains updated in-degrees of all vertices, `queue` has one additional element `neighbor`, `n` remains the total number of vertices, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must contain at least 1 neighbor, and `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `neighbor` is added to `queue`.***
