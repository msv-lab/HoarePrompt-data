The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables—`in_degree`, `queue`, and `n`—are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees of all vertices after decrementing by 1 for each neighbor of `node`; `queue` contains at least one neighbor of `node` that has an in-degree of 0; `n` remains the total number of vertices; `node` has been assigned the value of the first element popped from `queue`; `count` is incremented by 1.
