Output State: **`in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees of all vertices after decrementing by 1 for each neighbor of `node`; `queue` contains at least one neighbor of `node` that has an in-degree of 0; `n` remains the total number of vertices; `node` has been assigned the value of the first element popped from `queue`.**
