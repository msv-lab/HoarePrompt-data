Postcondition: ***`in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees, `queue` contains at least one neighbor of `node` with in-degree 0, `n` is the total number of vertices, `node` is the first element popped from `queue`, `count` is incremented by 1, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.***
