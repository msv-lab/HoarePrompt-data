Output State: **`in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing all neighbors of `node`; `queue` includes all neighbors of `node` that had an in-degree of 0 at the end of processing; `n` remains the total number of vertices; `node` is the last element processed from the neighbors of the first node popped from `queue`, and `count` reflects the total number of neighbors processed.**
