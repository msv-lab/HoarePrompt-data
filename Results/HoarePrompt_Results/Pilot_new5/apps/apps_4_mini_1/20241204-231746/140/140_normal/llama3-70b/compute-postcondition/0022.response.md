Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` has at least one neighbor for `node`, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, and if `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating that `node` is currently being processed and it has at least one neighbor in the `graph` that has been visited.***
