The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, where `neighbor` is a neighbor of the `node` that has been popped from `queue`. The states of `in_degree`, `queue`, `n`, `node`, and `count` remain unchanged except for the specific in-degree of the `neighbor` being reduced by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees, `queue` contains at least one neighbor of `node` with in-degree 0, `n` is the total number of vertices, `node` is the first element popped from `queue`, `count` is incremented by 1, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees, `queue` contains at least one neighbor of `node` with in-degree 0, `n` is the total number of vertices, `node` is the first element popped from `queue`, `count` is incremented by 1, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1.**
