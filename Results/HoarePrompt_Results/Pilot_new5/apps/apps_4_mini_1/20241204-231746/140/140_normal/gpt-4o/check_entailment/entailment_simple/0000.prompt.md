You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500); `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)); `edges` must contain `m` edges; `graph` is a defaultdict(list) containing directed edges as per the tuples in `edges`. For each edge (u, v) in `edges`, `v` is appended to `graph[u]`, creating a representation of the directed graph.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES', indicating a successful outcome based on the directed graph represented by 'graph' which is built from the provided edges, with no cycles present in the graph.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500); `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)); `edges` must contain `m` edges; `graph` is a defaultdict(list) containing directed edges as per the tuples in `edges`. For each edge (u, v) in `edges`, `v` is appended to `graph[u]`, creating a representation of the directed graph. The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` contains `m` edges, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) representing the edges after all edges have been processed, and the graph still contains at least one cycle.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that the graph contains at least one cycle

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from those vertices; n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, with the condition that n is at least 2.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices in the graph, where each value corresponds to the number of incoming edges for each vertex, and `n` is the total number of vertices in the graph. If the graph is empty (i.e., has no keys), the `in_degree` will remain as initialized, with each vertex having an in-degree of 0.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing all reachable vertices from the original nodes in `queue`; `queue` is empty, indicating that all vertices with in-degrees of 0 have been processed; `n` remains the total number of vertices; `count` reflects the total number of vertices that have been processed from `queue`.
    return count != n
    #The program returns whether the total number of vertices processed from queue is not equal to the total number of vertices, indicating whether all vertices have been processed


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
