The variable `rec_stack[node]` is assigned the value `True`. The previous state indicates that `visited[node]` is already `True`, which means the current vertex has been visited. The other variables, `node`, `graph`, and `rec_stack`, remain unaffected by this specific line of code. 

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing the current vertex, `graph` is a list of tuples representing directed edges, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True.**
