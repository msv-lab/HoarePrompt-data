The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `node`, and `count`) are not affected. The variable `in_degree` is updated for the specific `neighbor`, reflecting a change in the in-degree of that neighbor node in the graph.

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the updated in-degrees reflecting `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1, `n` is the total number of vertices, `node` has neighbors in the graph, `count` is incremented by 1**.
