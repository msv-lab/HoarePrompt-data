Output State: **`graph` must have at least 2 keys, `n` is greater than 0, `u` is the second key in `graph`, `graph[u]` must have `k` values, where `k` is the number of values associated with key `u`, `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of vertices associated with all values in `graph[u]`, and each value `v` in `graph[u]` has its `in_degree[v]` incremented by 1 for each occurrence in `graph[u]`.**
