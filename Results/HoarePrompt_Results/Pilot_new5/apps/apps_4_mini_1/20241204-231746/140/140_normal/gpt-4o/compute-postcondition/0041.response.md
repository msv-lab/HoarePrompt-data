The statement `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decreases the in-degree of the vertex `neighbor` by 1. The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is reduced from its current value to one less than that value. The variables `queue`, `n`, and `node` remain unchanged, and the state of `in_degree` reflects the updated value for `neighbor`. 

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices with `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1; `queue` includes the vertex `neighbor`; `n` remains unchanged; `node` is a valid vertex in the graph; `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.**
