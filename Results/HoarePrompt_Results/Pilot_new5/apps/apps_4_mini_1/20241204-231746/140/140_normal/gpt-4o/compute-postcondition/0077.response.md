Postcondition: ***`in_degree` contains updated in-degrees of all vertices, `n` remains the total number of vertices, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must contain at least 2 neighbors, and `neighbor` is the second neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 and becomes 0, then `neighbor` is added to `queue`.***
