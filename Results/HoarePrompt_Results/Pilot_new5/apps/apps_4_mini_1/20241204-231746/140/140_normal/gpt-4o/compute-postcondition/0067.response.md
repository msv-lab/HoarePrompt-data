Postcondition: ***`in_degree` contains updated in-degrees of all vertices, `queue` has one less element, `n` remains the total number of vertices, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must contain at least 1 neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.***
