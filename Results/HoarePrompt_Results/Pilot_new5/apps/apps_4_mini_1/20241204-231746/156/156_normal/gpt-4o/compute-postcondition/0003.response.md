The value of `k` is decremented by `n - 1`. Given that `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the new value of `k` will be non-negative. The other variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and `n` is always even; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m, and `k` is now equal to `k - (n - 1)`.**
