Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: an even integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a non-negative integer `k`. It checks if `k` is less than `n - 1` and, if so, outputs `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it calculates the number of full rows and remaining steps based on the adjusted value of `k`. Depending on whether the number of full rows is even or odd, it computes and prints the corresponding row and column based on the given rules. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. **
