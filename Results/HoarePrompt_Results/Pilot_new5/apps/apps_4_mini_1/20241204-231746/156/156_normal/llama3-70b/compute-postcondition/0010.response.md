Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer with 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer with 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is adjusted to `k % (n * 2 - 2)`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then `k + 1` and `1` have been printed. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, the printed values are `(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1)` and `((k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)`. If `k` is at least `n * 2 - 2`, the adjustments to `k` are still respected as described.***
