To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and check if it satisfies all possible input cases specified in the problem.

### Analyzing the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers, `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The line `k %= n * 2 - 2` ensures that `k` is wrapped around the total number of moves in one complete cycle of Lara's path.
3. **Movement Calculation**:
   - The first conditional checks if `k` is less than `n - 1`. If true, it means Lara is still moving down in the first column, and the output is simply the row `k + 1` and column `1`.
   - The second conditional checks if `k` is in the range of the rightward and upward moves `n * 2 - 2`. If true, it computes Lara's position during the snake-like movement.
   - The last condition is hardcoded to return `(1, 2)` for any `k` that is at least `n * 2 - 2`, which seems to indicate the end of the snake path.

### Checking Edge Cases
To ensure the program works for all edge cases, we need to consider:
1. The transition points between the downward movement and the snake-like movement.
2. The values of `k` at the edges of the conditions, especially around the modulo operation.

#### Edge Case 1:
For `k = n - 1` (the last move down the first column):
- For `n = 4`, `m = 3`, `k = 3`:
  - Expected output: `(4, 1)` (last row, first column).
- The program outputs: `print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)` which will evaluate to `(4, 1)` as expected.

#### Edge Case 2:
For `k = n` (the first move to the right):
- For `n = 4`, `m = 3`, `k = 4`:
  - Expected output: `(4, 2)` (first row, second column).
- The program outputs: In the second condition for `k = 4`, it will calculate as follows:
  - `n - (4 - 4 + 1) % (4 - 1) - 1` gives `(4 - 1) % 3 = 1` → gives row `3`.
  - `(4 - 4 + 1) // (4 - 1) + 1` gives `1 // 3 + 1 = 1` → gives column `1`.
- The program would output `(3, 1)` instead of `(4, 2)` which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Since there is an input case where the program does not yield the correct output according to the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
