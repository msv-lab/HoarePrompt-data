The variable `times` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged after executing this code. The variable `ans` is then defined as the minimum value of `times[K - 1]`, which assumes that the `times` list has at least `K` elements and that `K` is a positive integer within the specified range.

Since `times` is assigned a value based on the function `func_2` and `ans` is derived from it, we note that `times` will be some iterable of values, and `ans` will be some minimum of a specific index based on `K`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new information about `times` and `ans` while retaining the existing values of `x`, `y`, and `K`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the result of func_2(x, y, x, y), and `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]`.**
