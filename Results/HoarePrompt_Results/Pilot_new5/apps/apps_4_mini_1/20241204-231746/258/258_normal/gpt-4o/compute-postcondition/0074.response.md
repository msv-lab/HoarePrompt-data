Postcondition: ***`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned from `meats[j]`, and the current value of `c1` multiplied by `T` is less than `c2` multiplied by `T`.***
