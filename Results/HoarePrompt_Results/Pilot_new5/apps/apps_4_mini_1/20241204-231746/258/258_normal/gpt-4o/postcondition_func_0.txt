The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of different pieces of meat, a positive integer `K`, and a positive real number `T`. It evaluates pairs of meats to calculate a midpoint and checks if the sum of hardnesses for meats within distance `T` from this midpoint meets or exceeds `K`. If any valid midpoint meets this condition, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle edge cases such as an empty list of meats or cases where `K` is greater than the number of meats, which may lead to unintended behavior.
