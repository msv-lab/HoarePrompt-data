The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `index` is equal to 3. The previous value of `x` is unknown, but after execution, `x` will be equal to the integer value at the 3rd index of the `data` list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 4, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is now a list containing the tuples `(x, int(data[7]), c)` and `(x, y, c)`, where `c` is equal to `int(data[8])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[3])`, `index` is 3**
