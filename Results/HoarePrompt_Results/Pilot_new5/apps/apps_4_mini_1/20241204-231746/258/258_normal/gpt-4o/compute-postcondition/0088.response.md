The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Thus, no variables are modified, but we are skipping the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `j`, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and the current value of `(d * d2)` is greater than `d2`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
