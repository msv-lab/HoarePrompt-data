The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. This means that the value of `my` will now be updated based on the new value of `cy`. Other variables remain unchanged, but we need to reflect this change. 

Output State: **`my` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2 - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
