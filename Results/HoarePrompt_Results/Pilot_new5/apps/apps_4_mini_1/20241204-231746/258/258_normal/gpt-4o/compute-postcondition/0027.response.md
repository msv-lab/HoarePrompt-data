Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `N` and `K`, where `N` represents the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60) and `K` represents the number of pieces to be grilled (1 ≤ K ≤ N). It also accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of each piece of meat. The function then processes this input and calls another function `func_2`, passing the parameters to it. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. However, it does not handle any exceptions or input validation, which could lead to errors if the input format is incorrect.**
