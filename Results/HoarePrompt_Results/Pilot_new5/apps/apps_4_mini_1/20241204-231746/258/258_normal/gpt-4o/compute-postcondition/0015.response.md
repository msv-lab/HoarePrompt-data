The code appends a new tuple `(x, y, c)` to the `meats` list. The variable `y` has not been defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be greater than or equal to 2, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is now a list containing the tuple `(x, int(data[7]), c)` and after the execution, `meats` will also include the new tuple `(x, y, c)`, where `c` is equal to `int(data[8])` and `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 2, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is now a list containing the tuples `(x, int(data[7]), c)` and `(x, y, c)`, where `c` is equal to `int(data[8])` and `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`.**
