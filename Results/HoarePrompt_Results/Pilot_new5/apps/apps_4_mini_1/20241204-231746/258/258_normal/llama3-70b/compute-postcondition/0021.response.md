In this case, the function `func_2` is called with the parameters `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are known:

- `x` is -999
- `y` is 1000

The output of the function `func_2` can vary depending on its implementation, but we can infer that it will return a list (or array) since `times` is supposed to be sorted. The initial value of `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, but we currently do not have the value of `ans` before this operation, nor the specific output of `func_2`. 

Since we know that `times` will be assigned the result of `func_2`, we can only state that `times` will hold the output of that function based on the given `x` and `y`. Furthermore, `K` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and `N`, and `times` will be sorted.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated variable `times`, while leaving the other variables unchanged, since their values depend on an external function and are not directly modified by the provided code.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the output of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`**
