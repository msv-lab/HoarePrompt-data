According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `y`, which goes from -1000 to 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1.

After the last iteration, `y` would be -1000, so for the next iteration, `y` will be updated to -999. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` remains less than 1001, which is still satisfied since -999 is less than 1001.

State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted.**
