The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`, which represents the average of `y1` and `y2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `my` is updated based on the calculations, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`my` is updated based on the calculations, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`**.
