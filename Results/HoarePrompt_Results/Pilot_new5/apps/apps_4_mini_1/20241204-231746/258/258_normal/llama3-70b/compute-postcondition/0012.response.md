The `times.sort()` statement sorts the list `times`. The previous values of `times` are not provided, but after sorting, the elements will be arranged in non-decreasing order. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `ans` is updated to `min(ans, times[K - 1])**.
