Postcondition: ***`my` is updated based on `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `count` remains less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, and `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2) if `d * d2 > d2`, in which case we skip to the next iteration of the loop otherwise the program proceeds without skipping.***
