You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the i-th piece of meat, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats), and T is a positive real number.
```
def func_1(meats, K, T):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns True, indicating that the conditions based on the current value of count being greater than or equal to K are satisfied.

Case_2: The program returns True

Case_3: The program returns True

Case_4: The program returns True, indicating that the current value of count is greater than or equal to K.

Case_5: The program returns True, indicating a successful condition check based on the provided initial state and calculations involving `my`, `count`, `d`, and `d2`.

Case_6: The program returns True.

Case_7: The program returns True, indicating a successful condition was met based on the computed values of `my` and `count` with respect to the variables involved.

Case_8: The program returns True

Case_9: The program returns True

Case_10: The program returns False, indicating that the condition of the loop was not satisfied, and my retains its final calculated value while count reflects its initial sum for distances calculated before the loop.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
