The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so they retain their previous values. The output state includes the updated value of `dy`, along with the other variables that were mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`my` is updated to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` remains equal to the number of tuples where sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) and count is less than K, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is now equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
