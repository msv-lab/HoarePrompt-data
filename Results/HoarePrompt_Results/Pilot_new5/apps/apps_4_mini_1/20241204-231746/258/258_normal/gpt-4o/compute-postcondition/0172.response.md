Postcondition: ***`my` is updated to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` remains equal to the number of tuples where sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) and count is less than K, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, and `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`. If `d` is less than 0, then `my` is updated according to the specified formula, while other variables retain their respective values.***
