Output State: **`my` is updated to the final calculated value, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, or the loop did not execute if there were no valid pairs (i, j) in `meats`.**
