Output State: **`my` is the final calculated value after all valid iterations, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `count` may be greater than or equal to `K` or less than `K`, `i` is less than or equal to `N - 1`, `j` is less than or equal to `N - 1`, `d` is non-negative or invalid for the last evaluated iteration, and if the loop did not execute, `my` retains its original value and `count` is the initial sum of `c` for distances calculated before the loop.**
