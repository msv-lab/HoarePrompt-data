The code reads data from input and splits it into a list called `data`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The `data` variable is now assigned a list of string values, which represents the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), `K` is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be grilled (1 ≤ K ≤ N), `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, `data` is a list of strings obtained from input.**
