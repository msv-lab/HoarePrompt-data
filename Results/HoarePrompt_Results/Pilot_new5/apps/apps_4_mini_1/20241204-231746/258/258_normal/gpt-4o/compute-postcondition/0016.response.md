The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, but it has been affected by this operation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 2, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is now a list containing the tuples `(x, int(data[7]), c)` and `(x, y, c)`, where `c` is equal to `int(data[8])` and `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`; `index` is increased by 3.**
