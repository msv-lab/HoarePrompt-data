To simulate the execution of the provided Python code, we first analyze the impact of the code on the program state.

### Initial State:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `times` is the result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet provided is:
```
times.sort()
```

1. The variable `times` is sorted in place. The result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)` is unknown, but it will be ordered in ascending order after executing the sort operation. We do not know the specific contents of `times` before sorting, only that it is some list derived from the function.

### Impact:
- The variable `times` is modified to be sorted, but the specific values and how they change cannot be determined without knowing the output of `func_2(...)`.

### Output State:
Since we cannot specify the values in `times`, but we know they are sorted now, and the other variables remain unchanged, we describe the state as follows:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `times` is sorted.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted.**
