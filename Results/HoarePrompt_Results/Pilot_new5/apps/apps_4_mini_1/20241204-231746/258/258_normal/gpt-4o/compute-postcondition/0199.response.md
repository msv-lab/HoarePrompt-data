The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are defined as `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `(y1 - y2) / 2`, respectively. Therefore, the expression can be rewritten in terms of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`.

After the calculation, `d2` becomes `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)` which simplifies to `( (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 ) + ( (y1 - y2)^2 / 4 )`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the sum of the condition checking for each tuple in `meats`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `( (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 ) + ( (y1 - y2)^2 / 4 )`.

Output State: **`count` is the sum of the condition checking for each tuple in `meats`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `( (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 ) + ( (y1 - y2)^2 / 4 )`**.
