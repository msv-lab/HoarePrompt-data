Output State: **`N` is an integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing `N` tuples of the form `(x, y, c)`, where each x, y, c is equal to `int(data[2 + 3*i])`, `int(data[3 + 3*i])`, `int(data[4 + 3*i])` for i in range(N), `index` is `2 + 3 * N`, and `result` is the output of `func_2(N, K, meats)` which has been formatted and printed with six decimal places.**
