The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. There are no other updates to the variables based on the provided code snippet. The other variables retain their precondition values. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the sum of the condition checking for each tuple in `meats`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.

Output State: **`count` is the sum of the condition checking for each tuple in `meats`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.**
