The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` assigns the result of calling the function `func_2` with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y` to the variable `times`. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged in their values after this operation. However, the state of the variable `times` is now dependent on the output of `func_2`, which is not defined in the provided context. 

The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `K` is a positive integer such that `1 <= K <= N`, `times[K - 1]` is valid as long as `times` has been properly populated by `func_2`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `times` is now assigned a value based on the function call, and `ans` might change depending on the result of that function call. 

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is assigned the value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, and `ans` is updated to min(`ans`, times[K - 1])**.
