According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. The loop will execute `N` times, which is determined by the integer `N`. Since `N` is defined to be between 1 and 60, the loop will execute as long as `N` is at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, `K` is given as an integer between 1 and `N`, and `index` is initialized to 2. Since `N` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop can execute.

At the end of the last iteration, the current state does not affect the execution of the loop, but the loop will iterate `N` times, and the variable `_` will take values from 0 to `N-1`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the states that need to be adjusted are confirming that `N` is at least 1. Since `index` is set to 2, it could represent a valid index for an array or list, but it doesn’t directly affect the loop execution.

State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])` (1 ≤ K ≤ N), `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2**.
