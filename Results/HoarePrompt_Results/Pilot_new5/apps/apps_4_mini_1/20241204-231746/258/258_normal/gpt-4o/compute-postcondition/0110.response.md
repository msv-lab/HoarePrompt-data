The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code inside its body and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change, but the execution flow is altered. Therefore, the output state is: `my` is updated based on `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `count` remains less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 1; d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
