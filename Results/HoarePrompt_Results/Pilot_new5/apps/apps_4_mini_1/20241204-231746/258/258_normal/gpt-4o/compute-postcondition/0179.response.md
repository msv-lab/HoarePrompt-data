Output State: **`my` is updated to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` remains equal to the number of tuples, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is now equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(1/4) * ((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`, and the execution continues.**
