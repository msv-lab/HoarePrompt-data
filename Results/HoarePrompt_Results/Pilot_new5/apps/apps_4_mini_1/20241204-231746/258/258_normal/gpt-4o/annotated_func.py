#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the i-th piece of meat, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats), and T is a positive real number.

            count = sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T for x, y,
                c in meats)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `my` is the final calculated value after all valid iterations, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `count` may be greater than or equal to `K` or less than `K`, `i` is less than or equal to `N - 1`, `j` is less than or equal to `N - 1`, `d` is non-negative or invalid for the last evaluated iteration, and if the loop did not execute, `my` retains its original value and `count` is the initial sum of `c` for distances calculated before the loop.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the condition of the loop was not satisfied, and my retains its final calculated value while count reflects its initial sum for distances calculated before the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of different pieces of meat, a positive integer `K`, and a positive real number `T`. It evaluates pairs of meats to calculate a midpoint and checks if the sum of hardnesses for meats within distance `T` from this midpoint meets or exceeds `K`. If any valid midpoint meets this condition, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle edge cases such as an empty list of meats or cases where `K` is greater than the number of meats, which may lead to unintended behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat Takahashi wants ready, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat.

    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is the highest value less than or equal to the maximum hardness of meat pieces such that `func_1(meats, K, low)` is true, `high` is greater than `low + 1e-07`, and `mid` is approximately equal to `low`. The loop will stop when the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`.
    return high
    #The program returns high which is greater than low + 1e-07
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers. It performs a binary search to determine the maximum hardness of meat pieces that can meet the requirement defined by `func_1`. The function returns a value `high` that is greater than `low + 1e-07`, which represents the approximate maximum hardness.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), K is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be grilled (1 ≤ K ≤ N), and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `N` and `K`, where `N` represents the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60) and `K` represents the number of pieces to be grilled (1 ≤ K ≤ N). It also accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of each piece of meat. The function then processes this input and calls another function `func_2`, passing the parameters to it. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. However, it does not handle any exceptions or input validation, which could lead to errors if the input format is incorrect.
