The variable `y` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is 2, so `index + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `y` will be assigned the integer value of `data[3]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])` (1 ≤ K ≤ N), `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, and `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`.**
