The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is less than `K`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
