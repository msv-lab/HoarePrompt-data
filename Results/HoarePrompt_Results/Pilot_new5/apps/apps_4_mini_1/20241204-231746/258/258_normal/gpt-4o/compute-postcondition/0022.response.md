The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is not specified, but it will now be greater than or equal to its previous value plus 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 4, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is now a list containing the tuples `(x, int(data[7]), c)`, `(x, y, c)`, and the new tuple `(x, y, c)` has been appended to `meats`, `index` is increased by 3.**
