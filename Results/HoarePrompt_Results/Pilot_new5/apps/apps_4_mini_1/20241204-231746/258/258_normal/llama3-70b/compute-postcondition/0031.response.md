The function `func_2` is called with the parameters `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. The initial values are `x` is -998 and `y` is -1000. The function presumably processes these values and returns a result assigned to `times`. However, since the behavior of `func_2` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value or structure of `times`. 

The variables `K` and `N` remain unchanged, and it is important to note that `times` now holds the output of `func_2`. 

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the output of func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)**
