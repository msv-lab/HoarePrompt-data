The variable `mx` is assigned the value of `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The values of `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d` are still relevant and will be used to compute `mx`. 

Given the initial state, the variables involved are:
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`
- `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`

The value of `mx` will depend on these calculations, but we don't have specific values for `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `c1`, `c2`, or `T`. Therefore, while `mx` is updated based on the formula, we cannot provide a specific numerical value but can express it in terms of the relevant variables.

Output State: **`my` is updated based on calculations, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`, and `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
