According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `N`. The loop starts from `j = i + 1` and continues until `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been incremented by 1. Since the loop will execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `i + 2`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`.

State: **`my` is updated based on the calculations, count is less than K, j is `i + 2`, N must be greater than `i + 2`**
