Output State: **`my` is updated to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `j`, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` (updated value).**
