The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer satisfying the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. It also accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies the constraint -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100. Based on the output requirements, the function will perform operations on these inputs but does not specify the exact return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a`, where `a` contains `n` integers within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n integers where each integer satisfies -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100.**
