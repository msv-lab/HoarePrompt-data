`result` is assigned the value of `B - C`, where `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a` and `C` is the sum of negative integers in `a`. The values of `B` and `C` are not specified, but they can be calculated based on the list `a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of negative integers in `a`; `result` is equal to `B - C`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of negative integers in `a`; `result` is equal to `B - C.**
