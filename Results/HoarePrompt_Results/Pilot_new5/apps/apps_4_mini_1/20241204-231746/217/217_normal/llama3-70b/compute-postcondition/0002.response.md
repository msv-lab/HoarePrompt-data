The list `a` is sorted in reverse order, which means the integers will now be arranged from the largest to the smallest. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the sorting operation. The values of the integers in the list `a` are rearranged according to their magnitude but still satisfy the condition of being between -100 and 100. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated order of the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100.**
