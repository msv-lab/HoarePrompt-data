The variable `current_count` is assigned the value `0`. This means that `current_count` is explicitly set to `0`, but all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the values of the other variables are retained as they were before the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, and `char` is not a lowercase letter.**
