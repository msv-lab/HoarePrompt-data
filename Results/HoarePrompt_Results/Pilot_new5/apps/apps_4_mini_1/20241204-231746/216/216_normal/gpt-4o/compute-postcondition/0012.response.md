The code assigns `max_count` the maximum value between `max_count` and `current_count`. The initial value of `max_count` is 0, and the value of `current_count` is also 0, as per the initial state. Therefore, the maximum value will be 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, and `char` is not a lowercase letter.**
