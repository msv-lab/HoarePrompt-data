The code assigns `max_count` the maximum value between its current value and `current_count`. The state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_count` will be updated based on the comparison of its current value and `current_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the second character in `s`, `current_set` is updated based on whether `char` is a lowercase letter, `current_count` is updated accordingly, and `max_count` becomes the maximum of its current value and `current_count`.**
