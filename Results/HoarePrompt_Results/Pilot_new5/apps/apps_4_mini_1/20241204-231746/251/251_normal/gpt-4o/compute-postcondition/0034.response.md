According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, and `j` is still 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `j` is now equal to 1 and it is still less than `i`.

State: **`dp[i]` is either equal to `volumes[i]` or updated to `max(volumes[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])` since `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, `n` remains a positive integer, `i` remains at least 2, `volumes` is a list of volumes, and `j` is 1**
