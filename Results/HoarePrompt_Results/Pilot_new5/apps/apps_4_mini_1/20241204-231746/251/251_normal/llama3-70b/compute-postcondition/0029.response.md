The statement `dp[i] = cakes[i][0]` assigns the value of the first element of the `cakes` list at index `i` to `dp[i]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `cakes` are still valid, and the only change occurs in the `dp` array. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is the final index + 1; `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`.**
