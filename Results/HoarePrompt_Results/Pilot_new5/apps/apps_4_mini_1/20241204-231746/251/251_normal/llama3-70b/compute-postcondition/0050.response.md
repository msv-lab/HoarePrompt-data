According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which is greater than 1, and `j` is 1. This means the loop has executed for `j = 0` and `j = 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. 

Since `j` can take values from `0` to `i-1`, and `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `i`, which means `i` must remain equal to `n` and `j` will now be 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the state can be summarized as:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 2**
