Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index, `dp` is an array where `dp[i]` contains the maximum sum of cakes that can be obtained considering the constraints, `cakes` is a list of cake attributes, and if any `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]` for some `j < i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to include `cakes[i][0]`.**
