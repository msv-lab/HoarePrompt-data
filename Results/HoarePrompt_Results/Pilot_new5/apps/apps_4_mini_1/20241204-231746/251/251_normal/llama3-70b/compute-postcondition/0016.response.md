The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `cakes[i][0]`. Since `i` is currently 1, `dp[1]` will hold the value of `cakes[1][0]`. The value of `dp[0]` remains equal to `cakes[0][0]`, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 1 still holds after the code execution. The states of `n` and `dp[0]` are unaffected, while `dp[1]` is updated.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`**
