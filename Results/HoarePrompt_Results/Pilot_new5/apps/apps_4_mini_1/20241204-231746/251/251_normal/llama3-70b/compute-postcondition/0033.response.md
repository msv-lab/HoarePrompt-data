Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index + 1, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is equal to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j]` plus `cakes[i][0]`. The value of `dp[j]` remains unchanged, while `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`.***
