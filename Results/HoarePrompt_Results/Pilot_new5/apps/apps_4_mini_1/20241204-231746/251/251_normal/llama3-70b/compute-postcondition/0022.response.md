Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact step by step.

Initial State: 
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`
- `dp[1]` is equal to max(dp[1], dp[0] + cakes[i][0])
- `j` is 1
- `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]`
- `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`

The code:
```
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
```

1. The value of `dp[i]` (which is `dp[2]` since `i` is 2) is updated based on the current value of `dp[i]` and the calculation `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`.
2. Since `j` is 1, we need to use `dp[1]` in our calculations.
3. The condition `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` indicates that the condition for the update is satisfied.
4. The new value of `dp[2]` will be the maximum of the current `dp[2]` and the sum of `dp[1]` and `cakes[i][0]`.

The values of `dp` at the start of this operation remain valid post-execution with the updated `dp[2]`. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to max(dp[1], dp[0] + cakes[i][0]), `j` is 1; and `dp[2]` is updated to max(dp[2], dp[1] + cakes[i][0])**.
