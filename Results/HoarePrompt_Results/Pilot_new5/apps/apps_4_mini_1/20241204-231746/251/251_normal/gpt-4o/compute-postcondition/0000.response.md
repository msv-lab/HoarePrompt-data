The code snippet reads input data and splits it into a list of strings. The variable `data` will now hold this list. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it still represents the number of cakes. The list `cakes` is not affected yet, as the input hasn't been used to fill it. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of the `data` variable while preserving the previous values of `n` and `cakes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cakes (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `cakes` is a list of tuples; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
