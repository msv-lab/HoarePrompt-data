According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop starts from 1 and iterates while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the final index, and since `n` is greater than 1, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

If `i` is the final index at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `i` must be updated to the next index to continue the loop. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1, leading to `i` being equal to the final index plus 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be updated to be less than `n`, so we conclude that `i` will be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index + 1, `dp` is an array where `dp[i]` contains the maximum sum of cakes that can be obtained considering the constraints, `cakes` is a list of cake attributes**
