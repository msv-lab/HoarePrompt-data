The values of `r` and `h` are assigned based on the input provided by the user, where the inputs are integers. The values of `n`, `cakes`, and `_` remain unchanged, but `r` and `h` are now defined as integers based on the user's input. The output state does not change the constraints on `n` or the conditions for the loop's execution.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100,000; `cakes` contains one tuple `((math.pi * r * r * h), r, h)`; `_` is `k`; `r` is an input integer; `h` is an input integer.**
