Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index + 1, `dp[i]` is equal to the maximum of its original value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]` for all `j` in the range of 0 to `i-1` where `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` hold true. If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains equal to its original value.**
