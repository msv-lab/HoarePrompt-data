Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the radius `r` and height `h` of cakes. It calculates and stores the volumes of the cakes, sorts them by volume in descending order, and then determines the maximum sum of volumes of cakes that can be stacked on top of each other based on the constraint that a cake can only be placed on another if both its radius and height are smaller. Finally, it prints the maximum achievable sum of volumes from the last computed value in the dynamic programming table. **
