The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, constrained to the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000). Additionally, it accepts a parameter `cakes`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers representing the radius (`r_i`) and height (`h_i`) of each cake, with constraints (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains the radius and height of each cake, and to perform computations related to these cakes based on the provided parameters. However, the specific return value or outcome of these computations has not been provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and a list of tuples cakes, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of each cake (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000).**
