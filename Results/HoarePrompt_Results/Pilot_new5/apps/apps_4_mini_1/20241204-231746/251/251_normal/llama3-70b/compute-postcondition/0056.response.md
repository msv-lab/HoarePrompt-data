The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to process a set of data that must adhere to certain constraints. Specifically, it handles a positive integer `n` that must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. Additionally, for each cake represented by a pair of integers, `r_i` (radius) and `h_i` (height), both must be positive integers within the range 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000. The function outputs a result based on the provided data. 

However, since the specific output or functionality of the function is not provided in the given information, we cannot determine the exact nature of the output. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes data related to `n`, `r_i`, and `h_i` based on specified constraints; the exact output is unspecified.**
