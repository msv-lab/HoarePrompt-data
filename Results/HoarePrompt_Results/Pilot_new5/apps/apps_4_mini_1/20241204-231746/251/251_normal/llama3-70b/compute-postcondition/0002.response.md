According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100,000, the loop will definitely execute `n` times as it is a non-zero positive integer. Additionally, since the loop uses the underscore `_` as a variable, it indicates that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. 

The state of the `cakes` list is initially empty, but this does not affect the execution of the loop since there is no need for `cakes` to contain elements for the loop to work.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be between 1 and 100,000 (which is already satisfied), and the loop variable does not need any specific value as it is not utilized.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `cakes` is an empty list**
