The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j]` plus `volumes[i]`. Given that `dp[i]` starts as equal to `volumes[i]`, the new value of `dp[i]` will be either its current value (which is `volumes[i]`) or `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `volumes[j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to max(`dp[i]`, `dp[j] + volumes[i]`), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `j` starts at 0, and the current value of `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`.**
