The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]`. The values of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so it will now be `i + 1`. The conditions regarding the relationship between `volumes[j]` and `volumes[i + 1]`, as well as the requirement for `i` to be at least 2, still hold.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])`, `dp[j]` is unchanged, `volumes[i]` is unchanged, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `volumes[j]` must be less than `volumes[i + 1]` if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, and `i` is at least 2.**
