Output State: **`dp` is an array where `dp[i]` contains the maximum sum of cakes that can be obtained considering the constraints for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `cakes` is a list of cake attributes; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `dp[-1]` is printed (the maximum sum of cakes considering all constraints).**
