Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly calculates the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. It uses a method that counts the divisors of `n`, which is not related to the problem of finding weights of splits.

For example, if we consider the input `n = 8`, the expected output is `5` based on the example provided. However, the function `func_1` counts the number of divisors of `8`, which is `4` (the divisors are `1, 2, 4, 8`). This does not correspond to the problem's requirement of counting the different weights of splits.

Another case is for `n = 7`, where the expected output is `4`. The actual output from the function would be `4`, but that's coincidental and does not match what the function is supposed to calculate based on the given problem description.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
