The provided program is intended to find the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). However, the implemented logic does not relate to the problem description.

The program defines a function `func_1(num)` that counts the number of divisors of `num`. This is not aligned with the requirement to find the number of different weights of splits of \( n \).

For example, when \( n = 8 \):
- The valid splits with their respective weights are:
  - Weight 1: \([8]\)
  - Weight 2: \([4, 4]\)
  - Weight 3: \([3, 3, 2]\)
  - Weight 4: \([2, 2, 2, 2]\)
  - Weight 5: \([2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\) and \([5, 2, 1]\)
  - Weight 7: \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)

The correct weights based on the above splits would yield a result of 5 for \( n = 8 \). However, the implemented function does not compute weights of splits but instead counts the divisors of \( n \).

Thus, the program clearly does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not properly count the different weights of splits as required; it counts divisors instead, leading to an incorrect result.
