To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and how the code aims to fulfill them.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Definition of a Split**: A split of `n` is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sums to `n`.
2. **Weight of a Split**: The weight is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.
3. **Task**: For a given `n`, find the number of different weights of its splits.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over all integers from `1` to `sqrt(n)`. For each integer `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n`.
2. **Counting Weights**: 
   - `res += 2` is done for each factor because each factor contributes two weights: one from `i` and one from `n/i`.
   - However, if `i * i` equals `n`, it means `i` is a perfect square factor, and thus only one unique weight is added, hence `res -= 1` to correct for the double count.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Counting Weights vs. Factors**: The code counts factors of `n`, not the actual distinct weights of all possible splits. The problem statement requires finding distinct weights of splits, which is not directly related to the number of divisors.
2. **Missing Logic**: The relationship between the weights of splits and the divisors is not properly established. For instance, the weight of a split of `n` can be derived from different combinations of integers that sum to `n`, and the way the program counts does not reflect this requirement accurately.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider `n = 8`. The valid splits with weights are:
- Weight 1: [8]
- Weight 2: [4, 4]
- Weight 3: [3, 3, 2]
- Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2]
- Weight 5: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
- Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

This yields weights: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 â€” totaling 5 distinct weights.

The program will only return a count based on the number of divisors, which is incorrect as the weights of the splits do not correlate with the number of divisors.

### Conclusion:
The code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description as it misinterprets the task of counting the different weights of splits.

Correctness: **False**.
