Postcondition: ***`num` is greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1), `count` is either 6 or greater than 6, and `i` has been incremented by 1. If `num` is divisible by `i`, then the conditions regarding `num`, `count`, and `i` remain satisfied, and if `i` is not equal to `num // i`, these conditions continue to hold.***
