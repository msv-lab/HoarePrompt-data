The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `i` had been incremented once already. Since `num` remains greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1), and `count` is either 6 or greater than 6, the conditions related to `num`, `count`, and `i` will still hold true after incrementing `i`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `i`.

Output State: **`num` is greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1), `count` is either 6 or greater than 6, `i` has been incremented by 2.**
