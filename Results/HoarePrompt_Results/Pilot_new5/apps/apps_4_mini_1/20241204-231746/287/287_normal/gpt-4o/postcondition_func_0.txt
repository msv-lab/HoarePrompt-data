The function accepts an integer `num` (where 1 <= num <= 10^9) and returns the total number of divisors of `num` by iterating through all integers up to the square root of `num`. It counts both divisors `i` and `num // i` when `i` is a divisor, ensuring that duplicate divisors are only counted once. The function handles cases where `num` is a perfect square correctly by avoiding double counting.
