The code provided attempts to solve the problem of counting the number of different weights of splits of a given integer `n`. The problem description defines a split as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sums to `n`, and the weight is the number of occurrences of the first element in the split.

The program, however, does not directly address the problem as stated. Instead, it calculates the total number of divisors of the number `n`. This is fundamentally different from what is required, which is to count the distinct weights of valid splits of `n`.

To break it down:
1. In the problem, we are interested in the possible weights of splits. For example, the weights for `n=7` are based on the valid splits of 7, such as `[7]` (weight 1), `[3, 3, 1]` (weight 2), and so on.
2. The function `func_1(num)` simply counts the divisors of `num`, which does not relate to the weights of the splits.

The output hints describe that the function counts the total number of divisors of `num`, which confirms that the program is not addressing the problem's requirement.

Given the discrepancy between the problem description and the program's functionality, we can conclude that the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The code does not solve the problem as required; it calculates the number of divisors of `n` instead of the number of different weights of its splits. Thus, it fails to meet the criteria set out in the problem description. For example, for `n=7`, the expected output is `4` for the distinct weights from valid splits, but the program would return the number of divisors instead.
