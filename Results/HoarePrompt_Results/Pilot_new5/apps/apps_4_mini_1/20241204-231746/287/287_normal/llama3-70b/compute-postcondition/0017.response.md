The value of `res` is decreased by 1. The states of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as the code only affects `res`. The initial conditions regarding `n` being a positive integer and the relationship between `n` and `i` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` must be at least `(i + 1)`; `res` is decreased by 1.**
