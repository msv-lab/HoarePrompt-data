To determine the conditions under which the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the provided state right before the loop and the loop condition itself.

The loop condition is `i * i <= num`. Given the state:
- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\)
- `count` is 0
- `i` is 1

We evaluate the loop condition:

1. **Current Values**: 
   - At \(i = 1\), \(i * i = 1 * 1 = 1\).
   - Since \(1 <= num\) and given \(num\) is at least 1, the loop can execute at least once.

2. **Next Iteration**: 
   - If the loop executes once, `i` will increment for the next iteration. 
   - For the next iteration to be valid (i.e., for the loop to execute again), we need to ensure that \(i * i\) is still less than or equal to `num`. 
   - If we increment \(i\) to 2, \(i * i = 2 * 2 = 4\). This means we need `num` to be at least 4 for the next iteration.

Thus, we need to make sure `num` is at least 4 for the loop to execute more than once. Given the current constraints that `num` must be at least 1, we conclude that:
- `num` must be adjusted from its current value to at least 4.

No other states need to be adjusted since `count` is not influencing the loop execution, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to 4, `count` is 0, `i` is 1**
