The function `func` accepts three integers, `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, which are input by the user and expected to be within the range of 1 to 1500. The function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three integers. It first computes the GCD of `k1` and `k2`, and then uses this result to find the GCD of all three integers (`k1`, `k2`, and `k3`). If the final GCD is equal to 1, the function prints 'YES', indicating that the integers are coprime. If the GCD is greater than 1, it prints 'NO', indicating that the integers share a common divisor. The function does not return any value. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers, calculates their GCD, and prints 'YES' if they are coprime (GCD is 1), or 'NO' if they are not coprime (GCD is greater than 1). **
