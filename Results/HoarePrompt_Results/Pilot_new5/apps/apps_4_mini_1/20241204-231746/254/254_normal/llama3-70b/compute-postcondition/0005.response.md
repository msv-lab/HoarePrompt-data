The values of `a` and `b` are swapped during the execution of the code snippet. The `b` variable is updated to be equal to `a % b`, which is guaranteed to be a positive integer and less than the previous value of `b`. Since `b` must be greater than 0, and `a` is a positive integer, the values of `a` and `b` are now updated according to the operation performed. 

Given that `b` was originally equal to `a % b`, after the assignment:
- `a` now holds the previous value of `b`
- `b` now holds the result of `a % b`, which is less than the previous `b` and greater than 0.

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`; `b` is equal to `a % b` (which is a positive integer and less than the previous value of `b`).**
