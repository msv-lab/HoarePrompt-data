The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. This does not alter any variable values; thus, the initial values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the unchanged state of the variables along with the fact that the string 'NO' was printed.

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3` ≤ 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k_1` and `k_2`; `gcd_all` is equal to `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k_3)`, and `gcd_all` is greater than 1; 'NO' was printed.**
