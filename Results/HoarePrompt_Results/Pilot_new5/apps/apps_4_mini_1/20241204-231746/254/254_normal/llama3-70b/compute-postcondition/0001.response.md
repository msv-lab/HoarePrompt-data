The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `b` is now assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are all positive integers and fall within the range of 1 to 1500, the operation will yield a new value for `b` that is also a positive integer. The value of `a` will remain unchanged, while `b` will take on the value of the modulus operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is changed to `a % b`, and `c` remains a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer equal to `a % b`, `c` is a positive integer**
