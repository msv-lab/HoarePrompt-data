The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, representing time intervals of the three garlands, with the constraint that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500. After executing the function body, it returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.**
