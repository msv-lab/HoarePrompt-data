To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic against the problem description.

The problem describes a scenario where three garlands can be switched on at different times (x1, x2, x3) and they should ensure that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of these three times. The garland i will be lit at times x_i, x_i + k_i, x_i + 2k_i, and so on.

The expected output is "YES" if it's possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that there are no seconds after max(x1, x2, x3) where no garland is lit, otherwise "NO".

Now, examining the program:

1. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of k1, k2, and k3 using the formula:
   \[
   \text{lcm} = \frac{k1 \times k2 \times k3}{\text{gcd}(k1, k2) \times \text{gcd}(k2, k3) \times \text{gcd}(k1, k3)}
   \]
   This seems incorrect because it uses the product of GCDs in the denominator instead of the GCD of the overall product.

2. The conditions to check if the LCM is divisible by k1, k2, and k3 seem to assert if all intervals can align perfectly, but the problem description suggests that we need to ensure coverage at every second after the maximum x. Just checking LCM divisibility does not guarantee coverage at every second.

3. The program does not account for the fact that even if the LCM is divisible by all three k's, there could still be gaps in the coverage after the maximum of x1, x2, x3. 

**Counterexample**: 
Consider the input `1 2 3`. Here, we can choose:
- x1 = 1 (lit at 1, 4, 7,...)
- x2 = 1 (lit at 1, 3, 5,...)
- x3 = 1 (lit at 1, 2, 3,...)

This should output "YES" since there is coverage at every second. However, if we input `4 2 3`, the program will incorrectly determine coverage based solely on LCM checking.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the logic of ensuring at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum time, and there are cases where it can yield incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**.
