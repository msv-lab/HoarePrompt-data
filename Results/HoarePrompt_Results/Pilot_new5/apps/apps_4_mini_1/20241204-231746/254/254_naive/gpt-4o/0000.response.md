To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we analyze the functionality based on the inputs and outputs specified.

The problem requires us to ensure that at least one garland is lit at every second after the latest of the three startup times. This translates into checking if we can choose three integers \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) such that the lit times of the garlands cover all seconds after \( \max(x_1, x_2, x_3) \).

The provided code computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) and checks if it equals 1. However, this logic is flawed. The only scenario where the garlands could potentially leave gaps in their lit times would be if their GCD is greater than 1. This means that all three garlands would turn off at the same intervals, leading to a situation where there would be times when no garland is lit.

For example, if we consider the input \( 4, 2, 3 \):
- The GCD is 1, and the program will output "YES," suggesting that it is possible to light up all seconds after some time.
- However, if we take \( k_1 = 2, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 4 \), which has a GCD of 2, the garlands will only light up at even seconds after their respective times, leaving all odd seconds dark. The output should be "NO", but the program would incorrectly return "YES".

Thus, the program fails to correctly evaluate whether a continuous coverage of lit seconds can be achieved.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not account for scenarios where the GCD of the intervals results in periodic gaps, leading to some seconds not being covered by any garland's lit time.
