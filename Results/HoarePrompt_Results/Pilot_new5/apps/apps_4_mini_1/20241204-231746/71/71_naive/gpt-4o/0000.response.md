To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Description:
Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits from a given number `n` to obtain a number that is divisible by `10^k`. The output must not have unnecessary leading zeros, except for the case when the final result is exactly `0`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. The program reads `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes `count_zeros` to track how many zeros have been found and `to_remove` to track the number of non-zero digits that would need to be removed.
3. The program iterates through `n` in reverse order to count zeros and non-zero digits.
4. If it finds `k` zeros, it breaks out of the loop and prints the number of non-zero digits found so far (to be removed).
5. If it does not find `k` zeros, it prints `len(n) - 1`, which suggests it plans to remove all but one digit of `n`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Case:** `n = 30020, k = 3`
   - Expected output: `1` (remove the `2`, yield `3000`)
   - The program works correctly.

2. **Case:** `n = 100, k = 9`
   - Expected output: `2` (remove both `1` and `0`, yield `0`)
   - The program works correctly.

3. **Case:** `n = 10203049, k = 2`
   - Expected output: `3` (remove `1`, `3`, and `9`, yield `0`)
   - The program works correctly.

4. **Case:** `n = 0, k = 1`
   - Expected output: `0` (the result is already `0`, no digits need to be removed)
   - The program should handle this correctly since it will go through the loop but `count_zeros` will not reach `k` and it will print `len(n) - 1`, which is `0 - 1 = -1`, that is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program fails in the edge case when `n` is `0` and `k` is `1`. The output should be `0` because no digits need to be removed to yield `0`, but the program tries to remove digits leading to an incorrect calculation.

Correctness: **False**.
