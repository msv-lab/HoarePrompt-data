The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which are converted to strings. The previous conditions stating that `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000 and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 9 remain valid. The new states of `n` and `k` will be the string representations of the input values. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is a string representing a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 9.**
