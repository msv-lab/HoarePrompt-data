According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue as long as `n % 10 ** k` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, which means it is possible that `n` is not divisible by `10 ** k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain at least 1, and it must still not be divisible by `10 ** k`.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for `n`, but we must ensure that `n` is not divisible by `10 ** k`. 

State: **`n` is at least 1; `w` is increased by 1; and `n` must not be divisible by 10 ** k**
