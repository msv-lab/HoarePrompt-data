According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and its relationship with `k`. The loop will execute if `n % 10 ** k` is not equal to 0. Before the loop, `w` is 0, which does not affect the loop's execution. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute, `n` must not be a multiple of `10 ** k`. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` does not equal `0` when `k` is 1 or higher, as `n % 10 ** k` will equal 0 in those cases. Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be a non-negative integer not equal to `0` when `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9), `w` is 0**
