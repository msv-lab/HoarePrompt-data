The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (up to 2,000,000,000 represented as a string) and a positive integer `k` (between 1 and 9). It counts the number of trailing zeros in `n`. If the number of trailing zeros equals `k`, it prints the number of non-zero digits before these trailing zeros. If the count of trailing zeros is not equal to `k`, it prints the length of `n` minus one. Thus, it handles cases where `n` might have fewer than `k` trailing zeros and prints the length of the number minus one when such a condition occurs.
