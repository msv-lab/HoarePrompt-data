Postcondition: ***`count_zeros` is the number of trailing zeros in the integer represented by `n`, `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits before the last `k` zeros, `n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9. The number of trailing zeros in `n` is not equal to `k`.***
