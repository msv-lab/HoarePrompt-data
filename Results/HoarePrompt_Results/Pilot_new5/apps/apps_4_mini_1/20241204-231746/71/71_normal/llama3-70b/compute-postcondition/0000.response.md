The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values from input after being converted to integers. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer, the new values for `n` and `k` will depend on the user input, but they will still satisfy the conditions of the initial state. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000), `k` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9)**
