The value of `n` is updated by performing integer division by 10. Given that `n` is at least 1 and not divisible by 10, the new value of `n` will be the result of `n // 10`, which will be at least 0. The variable `w` is already increased by 1, and since the operation on `n` does not affect `w`, the output state will reflect the updated values of `n` and `w`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 0 (after integer division by 10), `w` is increased by 1**.
