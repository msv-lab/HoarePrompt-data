The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the given constraints, `s` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, and `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12. However, since the function does not take any input arguments, we cannot specify how these constraints are used or any output based on them.

Since there is no output or specific behavior defined in the output segment, we cannot provide a clear functionality description related to specific input values or their conditions.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not specify a return value based on the provided constraints.**
