The function `func` does not directly accept parameters in its definition. However, it is implied that it operates with two parameters: `s` and `x`. The constraints indicate that `s` is a positive integer constrained between 2 and \(10^{12}\), and `x` is a non-negative integer constrained between 0 and \(10^{12}\).

Based on the provided constraints, we can summarize the functionality of the function. 

Functionality: **The function operates with parameters `s`, a positive integer between 2 and 10^12, and `x`, a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12. The specific return value based on these parameters is not provided.**
