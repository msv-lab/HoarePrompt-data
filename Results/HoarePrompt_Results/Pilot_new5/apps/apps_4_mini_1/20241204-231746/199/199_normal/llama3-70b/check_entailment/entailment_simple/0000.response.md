The provided program is designed to count the ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. Let's analyze the code to determine if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:** 
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the length of the stick (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9). This is correctly handled.

2. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` initializes `ways` to 0, which will count the valid configurations.
   - The outer loop iterates over possible lengths `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
   - The inner loop iterates over possible lengths `b`, starting from `a` to ensure that `b` is equal to or greater than `a` and goes up to `(n - a) // 2`.

3. **Valid Pair Check:**
   - Inside the inner loop, the program checks two conditions:
     - `a != b` to ensure the lengths are different.
     - `2 * (a + b) == n` to ensure that the total length of the four parts (two of length `a` and two of length `b`) equals `n`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the `ways` counter.

4. **Return Value:**
   - Finally, the function returns the count of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program seeks pairs `(a, b)` such that you can form two pairs of lengths `a` and `b` each, which indeed can create a rectangle (`a, a, b, b`).
- Importantly, since `a` and `b` must differ (`a != b`), the rectangle cannot be a square, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description.
  
### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly checks the constraints based on the input size and the relationships between `a` and `b`.
- For any `n < 4`, the loops will not execute since the smallest valid stick length that can be split into four distinct positive lengths is 4. Thus, the function will return 0, which is appropriate.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find distinct pairs of stick lengths that allow for the formation of a rectangle without allowing the possibility of forming a square.

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the problem description is as follows:

Correctness: **True**
