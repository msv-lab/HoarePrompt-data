Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7, `ways` is the count of valid pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) = n with `a` as 2 and `b` ranging from 2 to (n - 2) // 2, while `a` remains 2 and `b` must be an integer that satisfies the conditions for all valid pairs. If there are no valid pairs, `ways` will remain the initial count of valid pairs.**
