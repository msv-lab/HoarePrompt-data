The value of `ways` is incremented by 1, meaning it is now one greater than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `2 * (b + 1) + a`, `ways` has increased by 1, and `b` is `b + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `2 * (b + 1) + a`, `ways` has increased by 1, `b` is `b + 1`**
