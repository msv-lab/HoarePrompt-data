According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `a` can take on another value within the range defined by `n // 4`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is currently 2, and the loop condition is based on `a` being in the range from 1 to `n // 4` (inclusive on the lower end and exclusive on the upper end). 

Since `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 6, the expression `n // 4` will yield a minimum value of 1. At `n = 6`, `n // 4` is 1. As `n` increases, `n // 4` can yield values greater than 1. 

Now, if `a` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `a` must increment to 3. This means we need to ensure that `3` is still less than or equal to `n // 4`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 12 (since `12 // 4` is 3).

Thus, the states to be adjusted are:
- `a` will be incremented to 3.
- `n` must be at least 12 to allow `a` to take on this value.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` ≥ 12); if `rem` is greater than 0 and even, then `count` is set to 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 2, and `rem` remains equal to `n - 8` (which is greater than 0 and even) if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`.**
