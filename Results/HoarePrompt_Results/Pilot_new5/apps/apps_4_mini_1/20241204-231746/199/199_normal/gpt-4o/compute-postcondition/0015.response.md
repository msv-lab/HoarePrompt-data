The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after the operation, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` ≥ 6); `count` is 2; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `rem` is equal to `n - 8` (which is greater than 0 and even).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` ≥ 6); `count` is 2; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `rem` is equal to `n - 8` (which is greater than 0 and even)**.
