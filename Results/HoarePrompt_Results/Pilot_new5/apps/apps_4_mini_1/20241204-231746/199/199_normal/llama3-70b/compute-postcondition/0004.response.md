The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is still greater than 3, and the other conditions regarding `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 3, `ways` is now 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `2 * (a + b)` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `ways` is now 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `2 * (a + b)` is equal to `n`.**
