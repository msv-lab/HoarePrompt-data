After executing the code, `b` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is 3, so `b` becomes 3 as well. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` ≥ 12); if `rem` is greater than 0 and even, then `count` is set to 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, and `rem` remains equal to `n - 8`.**
