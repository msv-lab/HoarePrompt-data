To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let’s analyze the code and its logic.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute pieces of two cakes (a pieces from the first cake and b pieces from the second cake) onto n plates such that:
   - Each piece is placed on a plate.
   - No plate can contain pieces from both cakes.
   - Each plate must have at least one piece of cake.
   - We want to maximize the minimum number of pieces on any plate.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The function `func_1(n, a, b)` uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible number \( x \).
   - It checks the condition using the helper function `can_distribute(x)`, which calculates if the total number of pieces can be allocated such that each plate can have at least \( x \) pieces.

3. **Logic of `can_distribute(x)`**:
   - It returns `True` if the total pieces (from both cakes) divided by \( x \) can fulfill the requirement for \( n \) plates.
   - The condition `a // x + b // x >= n` checks if the available pieces can meet the plate requirement.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - One key requirement is that no plate can contain pieces from both cakes, but this code does not explicitly partition the pieces between plates. It simply checks if the total pieces can be divided among the plates.
   - The approach assumes that it can freely distribute items from both cakes without adhering to the restriction of not mixing pieces from both cakes on any plate.
   - If \( n > a \) and \( n > b \), it may result in a situation where it's impossible to meet the plate requirement with the available pieces, as each plate must contain at least one piece and they cannot mix cakes.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `n = 3, a = 2, b = 1`. 
   - Here, we have 3 plates and only 3 pieces total (2 from the first cake and 1 from the second cake). According to the code logic, it would consider the pieces can be distributed, but it is impossible to satisfy the condition that no plate contains pieces from both cakes.
   - The expected output should be `0` since it’s not possible to distribute at least 1 piece on 3 plates without mixing the cakes.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle the constraints laid out by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
