Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements from the problem description. The primary issue lies in the `can_distribute(x)` function. 

### Explanation of the Issue
1. **Restriction on Plate Assignment**: The problem states that each plate must contain pieces from only one cake. However, the `can_distribute(x)` function simply checks whether the total number of plates that can be filled with pieces from both cakes (`a // x + b // x`) is greater than or equal to `n`. This does not account for the condition that each plate can only contain pieces from one cake.

2. **Distribution Logic**: The algorithm does not effectively segregate the pieces from each cake when distributing them across the plates. For instance, if `n` is greater than the number of pieces in either cake, the function may incorrectly conclude that a distribution is possible when, in fact, it is not.

### Example where it fails
Consider the input:
```
n = 5, a = 2, b = 3
```
According to the problem description, each plate should contain at least one piece from one cake without mixing. The best distribution here would mean each of the 5 plates gets at least 1 piece, but it is impossible to meet this requirement given the constraints of the cake pieces. However, the function may still return a valid `x` (like 1) because it does not properly check the distribution constraints.

### Conclusion
Therefore, due to the incorrect implementation of the distribution logic and the violation of the constraints set by the problem statement, the program fails to satisfy the problem's requirements consistently.
