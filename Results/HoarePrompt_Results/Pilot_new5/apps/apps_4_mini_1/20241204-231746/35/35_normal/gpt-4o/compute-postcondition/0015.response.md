The variable `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, the value of `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down to the nearest integer. Therefore, after executing the code, `low` is now one greater than `mid`.

The preconditions state that `low` is less than `high`, and now `low` will be incremented by 1, ensuring that it is still less than `high`.

Output State: **`low` is greater than or equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` before the increment**.
