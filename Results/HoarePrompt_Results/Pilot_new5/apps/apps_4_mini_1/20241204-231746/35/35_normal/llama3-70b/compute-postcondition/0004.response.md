The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100; `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Additionally, `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
