The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state includes the valid conditions of the variables and indicates the break.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100; `x` is a minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
