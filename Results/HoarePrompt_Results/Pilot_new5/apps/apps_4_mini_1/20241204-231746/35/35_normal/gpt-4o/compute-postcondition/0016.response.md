The code assigns the value of `mid` to `high`. The initial state indicates that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` is less than `high`. Therefore, after the assignment, `high` will now equal `mid`, which is also equal to `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is less than `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `high` is equal to `(low + high) // 2**.
