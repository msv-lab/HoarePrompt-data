Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer between `1` and `100`, and `b` is an integer between `1` and `100`, if `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
