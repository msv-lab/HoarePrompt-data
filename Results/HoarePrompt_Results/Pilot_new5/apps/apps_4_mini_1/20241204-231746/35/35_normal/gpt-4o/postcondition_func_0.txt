The function accepts three integer parameters: `n`, which represents the number of plates (with a constraint of 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), `a`, which represents the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and `b`, which represents the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100). It executes a binary search to find the maximum number of pieces that can be evenly distributed among `n` plates based on the `can_distribute` function. The function returns the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed minus one. If it cannot distribute any pieces, it still returns -1.
