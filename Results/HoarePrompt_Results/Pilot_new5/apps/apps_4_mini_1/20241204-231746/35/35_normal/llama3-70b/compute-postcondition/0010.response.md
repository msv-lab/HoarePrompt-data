`x` is decremented by 1. The value of `x` was previously defined as the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 1. Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are constrained by their initial states, the new value of `x` will be `min(n, a, b) - 2`. The conditions regarding `a`, `b`, and `n` that were checked to break out of the loop are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer between `1` and `100`, `b` is an integer between `1` and `100`, `x` is now equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer between `1` and `100`, `b` is an integer between `1` and `100`, `x` is now equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2.**
