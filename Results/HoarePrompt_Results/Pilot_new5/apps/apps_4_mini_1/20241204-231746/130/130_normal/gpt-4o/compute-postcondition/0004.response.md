`min_x` is printed, and based on the initial state, it is calculated as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is an integer value. The conditions of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` remain valid, and `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `min_x` has been printed.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18; `min_x` is printed and is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`, and it satisfies the condition that `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`.**
