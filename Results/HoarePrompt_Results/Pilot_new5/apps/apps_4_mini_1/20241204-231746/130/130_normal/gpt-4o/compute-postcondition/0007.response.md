Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. If `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, then `min_x` is printed and is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`. Otherwise, `min_x` is calculated as `(L + M - 1) // M` but it holds that `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`.***
