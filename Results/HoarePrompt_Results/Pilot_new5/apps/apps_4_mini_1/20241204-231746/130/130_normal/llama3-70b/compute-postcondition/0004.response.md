The code `print(-1)` outputs `-1` to the console but does not change any variables or their values. The initial conditions remain unchanged as no assignments or modifications occur. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged nature of the variables along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N, `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L`; output is -1**
