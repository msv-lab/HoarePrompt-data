The code assigns the values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` based on the input received from `sys.stdin.read`. The `map(int, input().split())` function converts the input into four integers, which will be assigned to `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. Since the initial state indicates that all these variables are positive integers, the output state will reflect their new values as integers based on the input.

The impacts of the code are as follows:
- `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` will now hold the values provided as input, but since the specific values are not given, we just denote them as input integers.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are assigned values based on input integers, where `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are all positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18**.
