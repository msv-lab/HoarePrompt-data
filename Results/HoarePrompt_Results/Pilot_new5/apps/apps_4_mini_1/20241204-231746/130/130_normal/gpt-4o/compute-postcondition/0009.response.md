Functionality: ** The function reads four positive integers `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` from input, where `1 ≤ K ≤ N` and `1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18`. It calculates the minimum number of times `min_x` needed to cover at least `L` using increments of `M`. If the total amount `M * min_x` does not exceed `N - K`, it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not handle cases where `M` or `L` are zero, nor does it validate the input constraints beyond assuming they are satisfied.**
