The code snippet `print(-1)` does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it simply prints the value `-1`. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18; `min_x` is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`; and it holds that M * min_x is greater than N - K.**
