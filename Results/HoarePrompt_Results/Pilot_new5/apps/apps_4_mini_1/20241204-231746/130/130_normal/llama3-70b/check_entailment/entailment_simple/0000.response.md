The program you have provided does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the requirements and the logic in the program to understand why this is the case.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Ivan has `K` collectible coins out of `N` different coins.
2. He has `M` friends who want to gift him coins.
3. All the coins gifted must be different.
4. At least `L` of the gifted coins must be new to Ivanâ€™s collection.

### Key Logic Points:
- The total number of coins available to gift is `N`.
- The coins that Ivan already has are `K`, so the maximum number of new coins that can be gifted is `N - K`.
- Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
  
### Conditions for Feasibility:
- The number of friends `M` must be less than or equal to the number of different coins available (`N`). If `M > N`, it's impossible to satisfy the requirement that each friend gifts different coins.
- The total number of coins gifted must be sufficient to ensure that at least `L` of them are new, which means `M * x >= L` where `x` is the number of coins each friend gifts.
  
### Program Analysis:
In the provided program:
```python
if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L):
    print(1)
else:
    print(-1)
```
- The condition `M >= N - K + 1` checks if the number of friends is enough to give Ivan at least `N - K + 1` coins, but this does not correctly capture the actual number of new coins needed, which should be `N - K`.
- The second check `M >= L` is also misinterpreted because it does not consider how many coins each friend must give.

### Errors:
1. The condition `M >= N - K + 1` is incorrect. It should be checking if `M` is less than or equal to `N - K`.
2. The output of `1` is returned without calculating how many coins each friend should actually gift.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the problem's requirements regarding the number of coins each friend must gift and the total number of new coins necessary. It does not correctly verify the conditions outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
