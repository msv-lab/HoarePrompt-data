To evaluate the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, letâ€™s analyze it step by step.

### Program Review
The program's logic primarily checks two conditions:
1. If the number of friends \( M \) is greater than or equal to \( N - K + 1 \), implying that the friends can gift enough different coins given that \( K \) coins are already in Ivan's collection.
2. If the number of friends \( M \) is also greater than or equal to \( L \), ensuring that the minimum number of new coins to be added to Ivan's collection is satisfied.

If both conditions are true, it prints `1`, indicating that each friend can gift at least one coin. Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy the conditions.

### Edge Case Analysis
1. **Edge Case 1**: 
   - Input: `N = 10, M = 11, K = 2, L = 4`
   - Expected output: `-1` (as there are only 10 different coins but 11 friends)
   - Program output: `-1` (correct)

2. **Edge Case 2**: 
   - Input: `N = 20, M = 15, K = 2, L = 3`
   - Expected output: `1` (friends can gift coins and at least 3 new coins will be added)
   - Program output: `1` (correct)

3. **Edge Case 3**: 
   - Input: `N = 10, M = 10, K = 10, L = 1`
   - In this case, all 10 coins are in Ivan's collection, friends cannot gift any new coins because there are no different coins left. 
   - Expected output: `-1` (as friends can't gift any new coins)
   - Program output: `-1` (correct)

4. **Edge Case 4**: 
   - Input: `N = 5, M = 3, K = 1, L = 3`
   - Expected output: `-1` (needs at least 3 new coins but can only gift 4 total coins, since 1 is already in collection)
   - Program output: `-1` (correct)

### Conclusion
The program logic does not account for cases where friends can't give new coins due to insufficient different coins remaining. Specifically:
- It doesn't check if \( M \times \text{coins per friend} \) exceeds the total different coins available, thereby not ensuring that friends can indeed gift enough different coins.

### Counterexample
- **Counterexample Input**: If \( N = 3, M = 3, K = 1, L = 3 \):
  - Expected output: `-1` (since they cannot gift 3 new different coins with only 2 left)
  - Program output based on conditions: `1` (which is incorrect)

### Final Determination
Correctness: **False**.
