To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, I will analyze the logic and check for edge cases.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Ivan has a collection of coins (K) and N different collectible coins in total.
- He has M friends who want to gift him coins. 
- Each friend must gift the same number of coins, and all coins given must be different.
- At least L coins from the total gifts must be new (i.e., not in Ivan's current collection).

**Program Logic:**
1. The minimum number of coins each friend must gift is calculated using the formula `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M`, which effectively computes the ceiling of L/M.
2. The program then checks if the total number of coins gifted (`M * min_x`) can fit within the remaining distinct coins available (`N - K`).
3. If it fits, it prints the minimum number of coins each friend should gift (`min_x`). If not, it prints `-1`.

**Edge Cases:**
1. If `N - K < M`, it's impossible for all friends to give different coins, which should directly yield `-1`.
2. If `L > N - K`, it's also impossible to meet the requirement of new coins.
3. Large values of M and L may lead to potential overflow or incorrect calculations. However, Python handles large integers, so it shouldn't be a problem with the calculations themselves.

**Testing a Specific Case:**
- Let's consider the case: `N = 10, M = 11, K = 2, L = 4`.
  
  Here:
  - N (total coins) = 10
  - M (friends) = 11
  - K (coins Ivan already has) = 2
  - L (minimum new coins needed) = 4
  
  The calculation steps:
  - Remaining coins = `N - K = 10 - 2 = 8`
  - Minimum coins each friend must gift = `min_x = (4 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 14 // 11 = 1` (rounding up)
  - Total coins gifted = `M * min_x = 11 * 1 = 11`
  
  However, since there are only 8 different coins available (`N - K`), it's impossible to satisfy the condition of different coins, leading to a correct output of `-1`.

In conclusion, the program correctly handles the provided edge cases and constraints. However, it does rely heavily on the mathematical logic being sound under all conditions, especially when considering the limits of integer values.

**Final Evaluation:**
After considering the logic and potential edge cases, I find that the program correctly implements the solution as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift while checking constraints related to the total number of coins available, ensuring that all conditions are met before arriving at the output.
