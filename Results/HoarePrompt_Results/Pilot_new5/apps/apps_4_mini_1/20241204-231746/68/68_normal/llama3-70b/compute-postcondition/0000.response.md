The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned based on input. The `map(int, input().split())` function will take the input, split it into components, and convert each component to an integer. Therefore, `x`, `y`, and `z` will now hold specific integer values provided as input, while their initial conditions that they must be within the range of 0 to 100 remain valid. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers with specific values entered as input, such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100.**
