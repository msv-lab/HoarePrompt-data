Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers with values between 0 and 100. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '+'; otherwise, if `x` is less than `y`, the program continues with the current values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. If `x` equals `y`, the function prints '0' if `z` is 0, and if `z` is greater than 0, it checks `x <= y + z` and `x >= y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?', indicating that `x` meets the conditions of being less than or equal to `y + z`.***
