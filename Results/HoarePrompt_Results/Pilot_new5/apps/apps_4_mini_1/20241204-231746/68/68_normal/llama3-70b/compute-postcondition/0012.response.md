Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers with values such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `z` is 0, the output '0' is printed. If `z` is greater than 0, then `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x` <= `y + z`), `x` is greater than or equal to `y` (i.e., `x >= y`), and the current value of `x` is equal to `y` (i.e., `x == y`).***
