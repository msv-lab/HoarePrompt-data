The code `print('+')` outputs the character `+`, but it does not change the values of any variables. The precondition remains the same since no variables were modified. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the initial conditions along with the fact that a `+` was printed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers with specific values entered as input such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, the current value of `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, meaning that `x > y + z`; printed '+'**
