The code snippet `print('-')` outputs a string `'-'` to the console. There are no variables affected or changed by this code execution. The current values and conditions of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers with values such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. The value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x` <= `y + z`). The current value of `x` is less than `y`.**
