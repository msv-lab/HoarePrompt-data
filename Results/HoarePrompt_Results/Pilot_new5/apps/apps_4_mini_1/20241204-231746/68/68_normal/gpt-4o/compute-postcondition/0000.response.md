The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the user input, which will be integers within the range from 0 to 100. Since we don't know the specific input values, we can only express that they will be updated accordingly. The previous constraints on `x`, `y`, and `z` remain valid. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `x`, `y`, `z` are assigned new integer values from input.**
