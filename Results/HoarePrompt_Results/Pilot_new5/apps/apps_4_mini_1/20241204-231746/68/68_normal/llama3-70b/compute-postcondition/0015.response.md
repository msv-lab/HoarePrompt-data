Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers with values such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, the output '0' is printed. If `z` is greater than 0, `x` equals `y`, and both conditions `x <= y + z` and `x >= y` hold true. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to `y`, then `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and the output is '?'.***
