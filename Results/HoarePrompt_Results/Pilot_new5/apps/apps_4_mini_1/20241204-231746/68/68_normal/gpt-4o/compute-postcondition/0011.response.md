The code `print('?')` outputs a string and does not modify any variables. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values based on the initial state.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; and `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.**
