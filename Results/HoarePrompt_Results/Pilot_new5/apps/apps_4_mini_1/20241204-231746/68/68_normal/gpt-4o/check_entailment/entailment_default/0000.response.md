Let's analyze the provided code against the problem description along with the output hints.

**Problem Description**: The task is to determine the voting outcome based on three integers representing upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and unknown votes (`z`). The results can be one of three outcomes: "+", "-", or "0", or it may be uncertain ("?").

**Code**:
```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
        print('-')
    elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
        print('+')
    else:
        print('?')
```

**Output Hints**: The function checks the maximum and minimum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the votes and prints accordingly:
- If maximum upvotes (`x + z`) is less than minimum downvotes (`y`), it prints `'-'`
- If maximum downvotes (`y + z`) is less than minimum upvotes (`x`), it prints `'+'`
- If neither condition is met, it prints `'?'`

### Analyzing Edge Cases:
1. **Case when `z = 0`**:
   - If `x > y`, the output should be `'+'`, if `x < y`, it should be `'-'`, and if `x == y`, it should be `'0'`.
   - The code handles this correctly.

2. **Case when `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`**:
   - Maximum upvotes = 0 + 1 = 1, minimum downvotes = 0.
   - The code would print `'+'`, which is correct because there is one upvote possible.

3. **Case when `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`**:
   - Maximum upvotes = 1, minimum downvotes = 1.
   - The code prints `'0'`, which is correct.

4. **Case when `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`**:
   - Both upvotes and downvotes are zero. The code would print `'?'`, which is correct since the outcome is uncertain (could go either way).

5. **General case where `x + z` can be equal to `y`**:
   - For example, if `x = 2`, `y = 3`, `z = 1`. Then max upvotes = 3, min downvotes = 3. The code would print `'?'`, which is correct because the outcome depends on the unknown vote.

### Confirming Output Hints:
The output hints correctly summarize the function's behavior as it checks the maximum and minimum boundaries of upvotes and downvotes. They accurately explain the logic behind each condition.

### Final Assessment:
Upon reviewing the code, its handling of various scenarios is correct, including edge cases where `z` is zero or greater than zero. The conditions cover all scenarios outlined in the problem description, and no potential edge cases lead to incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **True**. 
The function accurately determines the voting outcome based on the specified rules, accounting for all possibilities as described.
