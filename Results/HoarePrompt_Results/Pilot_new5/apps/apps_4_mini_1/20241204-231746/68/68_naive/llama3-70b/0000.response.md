To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the code and see if it covers all scenarios described.

The problem states that we have three types of votes: upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and unknown votes (z). The goal is to determine the overall result based on these votes. The possible results are "+" if upvotes are greater than downvotes, "-" if downvotes are greater than upvotes, "0" if they are equal, or "?" if the result is uncertain due to varying potential contributions from unknown votes.

The provided code does the following:
1. It reads inputs for x, y, and z.
2. It checks if upvotes (x) are greater than the sum of downvotes (y) and unknown votes (z). If true, it prints '+'.
3. It checks if upvotes (x) are less than downvotes (y). If true, it prints '-'.
4. If upvotes (x) and downvotes (y) are equal, it checks if there are any unknown votes:
   - If z is zero, it prints '0'.
   - Otherwise, it prints '?' due to uncertainty.
5. For any other case, it defaults to printing '?'.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- If `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, the result should be '?', which is correctly handled.
- If `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`, the output should be '-', and this output is also correct.
- If `x = 2`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, the output should be '+', and the program handles this correctly.
- If `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`, the output should be '0', handled correctly.

The issue arises in the following important scenario:
- If `x = 3`, `y = 5`, and `z = 3`, the result could be '+' (if all 3 unknown votes are upvotes) or '-' (if all 3 unknown votes are downvotes). But the program would print '?' as expected, which is correct for this case.

Now, testing another edge case:
- If `x = 5`, `y = 5`, and `z = 0`, the program should output '0', which is correctly handled.

However, upon further consideration, the program outputs '?' for ambiguous situations. If `x + z` can equal `y`, or if `y + z` can equal `x`, then the output is correctly uncertain. 

The overall logic is sound and covers all scenarios described, including edge cases and ambiguity due to unknown votes.

After careful review, I conclude that the provided code meets all the criteria of the problem description without missing any conditions.

Correctness: **True**.
