According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` contains more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` contains at least one element including `i + j`, and `j` is currently selected from `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must contain at least one more element after the current `j` has been processed. 

Since `j` is selected from `additional_marks`, we can conclude that for the next iteration, `j` must be the next element in `additional_marks`. Assuming that `additional_marks` has at least one more element left, the loop can continue to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least one more element, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and now `j` is the next element from `additional_marks`.**
