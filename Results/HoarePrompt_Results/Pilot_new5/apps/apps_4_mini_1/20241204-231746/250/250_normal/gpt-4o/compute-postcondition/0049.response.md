The variable `new_marks` is updated to include `mark - y`. Since it is true that either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` will have the additional value of `mark - y` added to it. The other conditions regarding `n`, `mark`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `marks_set` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `y_found` is not true, the conditions `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` are not in `marks_set`, `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` includes `mark - y`.**
