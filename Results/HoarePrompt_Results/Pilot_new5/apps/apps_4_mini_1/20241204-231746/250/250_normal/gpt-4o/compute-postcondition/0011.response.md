Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least one element, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, and if either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is found in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is set to True and `y_found` is set to True. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
