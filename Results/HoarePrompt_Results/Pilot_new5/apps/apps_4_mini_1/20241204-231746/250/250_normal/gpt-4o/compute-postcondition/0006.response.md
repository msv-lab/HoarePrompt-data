Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is an integer input (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l), `marks` must have at least 1 element, `mark` is the first element in `marks`. The current value of `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`.***
