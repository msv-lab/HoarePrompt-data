The variable `new_marks` is assigned the value of an empty set. The other variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `marks`, `x_found`, and `y_found` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with `n` elements, `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (at least one of them is false), and `new_marks` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with `n` elements, `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (at least one of them is false), `new_marks` is an empty set.**
