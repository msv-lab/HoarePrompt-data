`need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The conditions regarding `marks[j] - marks[i]` and the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are still valid after this assignment, but are not directly affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `y`.**
