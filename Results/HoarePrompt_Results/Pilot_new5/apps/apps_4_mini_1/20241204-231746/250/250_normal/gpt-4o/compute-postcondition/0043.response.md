Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, and `y_found` is False. If any of the conditions `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` remains unchanged. If none of these conditions are true, and if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` will include the value `mark - x`. Otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
