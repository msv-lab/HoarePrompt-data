Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `mark` is the third element in `marks`, and if both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, then they remain unchanged and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either `x_found` or `y_found` is False, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
