Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `mark` is the second element in `marks`, `x_found` is True, and `y_found` is True. If either `mark + y` or `mark - y` exists in `marks_set`, the program continues to execute under these conditions; otherwise, the execution does not enter this conditional block.***
