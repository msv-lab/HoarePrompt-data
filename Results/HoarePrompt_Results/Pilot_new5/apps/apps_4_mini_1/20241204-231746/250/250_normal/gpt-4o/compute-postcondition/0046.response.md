The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value of `mark + y` to the `new_marks` set. Since `new_marks` remains unchanged according to the preconditions, the addition of `mark + y` will modify `new_marks` to include this new value.

The initial state indicates that `mark` is the first element in `marks`, and `y_found` is not true. The other variables do not change due to this operation. Thus, the relevant change involves the `new_marks` set, which will now include the value `mark + y`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `new_marks` includes `mark + y`**.
