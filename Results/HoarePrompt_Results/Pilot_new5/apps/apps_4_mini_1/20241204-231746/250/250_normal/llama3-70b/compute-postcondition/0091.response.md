Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains all viable values of `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`, `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element of `marks`. If the loop executes, all viable combinations of `i + j` that satisfy the conditions will have been added to `additional_marks`, including all combinations that were not previously in `marks`. If the loop does not execute, `additional_marks` remains unchanged and contains only viable values.**
