The variable `y_found` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is an integer input (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `a` is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l), `marks` is a list of integers from input, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False.
