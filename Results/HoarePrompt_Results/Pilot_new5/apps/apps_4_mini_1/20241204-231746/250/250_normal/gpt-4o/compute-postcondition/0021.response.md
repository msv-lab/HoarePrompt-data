Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `mark` is the second element in `marks`, `x_found` is True, and `y_found` is True. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either condition is not met, no action is taken regarding the loop or if statement.***
