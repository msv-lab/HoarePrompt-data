Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` must contain at least 1 element, `marks` is a list that must contain at least 1 element. The current values of `i` and `j` satisfy the condition that their sum is less than or equal to `l`, and this sum is not present in the list `marks`.***
