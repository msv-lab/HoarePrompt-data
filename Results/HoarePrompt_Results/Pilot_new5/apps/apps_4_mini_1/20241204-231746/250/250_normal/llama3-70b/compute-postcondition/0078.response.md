Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` now contains at least one more element, `marks` is a list that contains at least 1 element, `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`, and if `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` includes the new value `i + j`.***
