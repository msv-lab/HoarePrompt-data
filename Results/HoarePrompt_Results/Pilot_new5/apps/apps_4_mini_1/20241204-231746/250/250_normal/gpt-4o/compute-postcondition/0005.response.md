According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `marks`. For the loop to execute at least once, the `marks` list must contain at least 1 element. Since `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are all within the provided constraints, we need to ensure that `marks` is not empty. At the beginning of the loop, the variable `mark` will refer to the first element in `marks`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the `marks` list must have at least 1 element and `mark` should be assigned the first element of the `marks` list.

State: **`n` is an integer input (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is an integer input (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `a` is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l), `marks` must have at least 1 element, `mark` is the first element in `marks`**
