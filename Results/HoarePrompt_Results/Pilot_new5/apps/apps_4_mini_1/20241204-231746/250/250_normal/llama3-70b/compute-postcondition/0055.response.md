The variable `need_x` is assigned the value of `True`, which is already its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, `need_y` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, `need_y` remains unchanged**.
