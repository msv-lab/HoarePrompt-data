The value of `result` is updated by appending the value of `x` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `new_marks` is an empty set, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `result` now contains the value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `new_marks` is an empty set, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `result` is a list containing `x`**.
