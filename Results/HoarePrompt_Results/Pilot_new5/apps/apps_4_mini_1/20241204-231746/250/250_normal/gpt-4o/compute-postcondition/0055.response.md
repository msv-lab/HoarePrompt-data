`new_marks` is a set that will have the value of `mark - x` added to it. Since `mark` is the second element in `marks` and `x` has not been defined in the initial state, the expression `mark - x` will directly depend on the value of `x`. The variable `x_found` remains `False`, and the other variables retain their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `mark` is the second element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `new_marks` now contains the value equal to `mark - x`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mark` is the second element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `new_marks` contains `mark - x`**.
