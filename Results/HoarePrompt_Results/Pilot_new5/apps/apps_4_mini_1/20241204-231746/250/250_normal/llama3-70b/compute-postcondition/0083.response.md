The code appends the value of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` list. Given the initial state, `i` is the first element of `marks`, and `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`, while `i + j` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 1 viable value including the new value `i + j`, `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`, the current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, and `i + j` is not in `marks`.**
