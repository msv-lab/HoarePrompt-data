The variable `d[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the next integer in the list `a`. The current state of `d` is updated based on the value of `i`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers, `d[i]` is updated to its previous value plus 1, and `i` is the next integer in `a`.**
