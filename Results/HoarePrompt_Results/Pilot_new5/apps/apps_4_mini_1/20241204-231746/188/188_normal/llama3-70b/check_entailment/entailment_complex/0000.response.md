Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The program counts the occurrences of each integer in the list of cards and checks if exactly two distinct integers exist that both occur `n // 2` times. However, it is possible for two integers to exist that occur `n // 2` times, but they may not account for all cards. 

2. **Condition for Fairness**: The problem statement requires that Petya and Vasya must be able to take all `n` cards. The program only checks for two integers appearing `n // 2` times each, which can lead to situations where the total count of cards does not equal `n`. For example, if the input has three distinct integers like `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3` (where no integer appears `n // 2` times), the program would incorrectly return "NO" despite being able to split the cards between two players fairly with `1` and `2`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle cases where all integers on the cards are the same, or if only one integer exists. The problem explicitly states that Petya and Vasya must choose different integers, and the program's logic does not sufficiently enforce or check for this condition when two integers are the same.

Thus, the implementation does not meet the problem description's requirements for all scenarios, leading to its incorrectness.
