`d` is assigned an empty dictionary. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. The state of `n` is still as defined, `a` is still the list of integers, and `i` is still `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `i` is `n - 1; `d` is an empty dictionary.**
