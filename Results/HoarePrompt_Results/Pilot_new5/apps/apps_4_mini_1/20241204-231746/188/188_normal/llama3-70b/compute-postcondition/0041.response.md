The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is `i`, `c` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `a1` is the appropriate value based on `c`, `a2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
