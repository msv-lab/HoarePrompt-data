The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`; `c` is 0.
