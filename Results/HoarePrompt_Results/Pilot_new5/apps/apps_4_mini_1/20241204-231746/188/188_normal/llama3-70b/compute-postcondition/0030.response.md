The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is the first key in the dictionary `d`. The value of `a1` will now be equal to `i`. Other variables remain unaffected, so the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` that must have at least 1 key; `c` is 0; `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is -1; `i` is the first key in `d`; the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`; and the current value of `c` is equal to 0.**
