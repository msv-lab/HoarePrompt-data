To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem description and the logic implemented in the code.

**Problem Description Summary:**
- There are `n` cards, each with an integer written on it.
- `n` is guaranteed to be an even number.
- Petya and Vasya must choose distinct integers from the integers on the cards such that:
  - Each integer can be chosen in a way that the total number of cards held by each player is the same.
  - If it's impossible for them to do so, the program should print "NO".
  - If it's possible, it should print "YES" and the two integers chosen.

**Program Logic Review:**
1. The program reads `n` and then reads `n` integers into the list `cards`.
2. It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each number.
3. It sorts unique numbers based on their frequency.
4. It checks:
   - If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it prints "NO".
   - If the two most frequent unique numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times, it prints "YES" and those two numbers.
   - If not, it prints "NO".

**Output Hints Review:**
- The hints suggest that the function checks for at least two unique numbers and looks for the two most frequent numbers to ensure they can evenly split the cards.
- It correctly identifies that if there are fewer than two unique numbers, it should return "NO".

**Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**
1. The program does not consider the case where there might be more than two unique numbers, but the two most frequent numbers do not satisfy the equal distribution condition.
2. For the case where multiple unique values exist, but none can split the total number of cards evenly, it may incorrectly return "YES" if the two highest frequencies are equal.
3. The program does not handle cases where the input is invalid, which is not a problem as per the constraints given (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and n is even).

**Specific Failure Case:**
- For example, consider the input:
  ```
  6
  1
  1
  2
  2
  3
  3
  ```
  The output should be "NO" as both players cannot pick two distinct numbers and have the same count. The program would output "NO" correctly since neither number can be chosen to satisfy the conditions. 

However, consider this input:
```
4
1
1
2
3
```
The expected output here should be "NO" (as they can't both select a number that leads to an equal distribution of cards), but the program might not explicitly check that picking two numbers results in all cards being accounted for.

**Conclusion:**
While the program works for a variety of cases and follows the hints appropriately, it fails to handle the logic where the two numbers picked must allow all cards to be split evenly. Thus, it may incorrectly return "YES" when it should return "NO".

Correctness: **False**.
