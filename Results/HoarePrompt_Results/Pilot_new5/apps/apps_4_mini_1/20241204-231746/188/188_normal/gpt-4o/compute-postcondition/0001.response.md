The variable `cards` is assigned a list of `n` integers where each integer is obtained from user input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer, and each integer in the list `cards` will be between 1 and 100. Therefore, after executing the code, `cards` will contain `n` integers, each within the specified range. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but `cards` now holds the list of integers collected from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `cards` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100.**
