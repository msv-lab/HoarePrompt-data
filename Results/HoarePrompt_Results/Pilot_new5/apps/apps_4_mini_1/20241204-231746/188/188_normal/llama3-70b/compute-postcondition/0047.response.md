The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state provides that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary where the next key is the next key to `i`, and `c` and `a1` are unchanged. Since we do not have a specific value for `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a2`. Therefore, the output state remains general, keeping track of all unchanged variables and the new assignment for `a2`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is the next key to `i`; `c` is unchanged; `a1` is unchanged; `a2` is equal to `i`.**
