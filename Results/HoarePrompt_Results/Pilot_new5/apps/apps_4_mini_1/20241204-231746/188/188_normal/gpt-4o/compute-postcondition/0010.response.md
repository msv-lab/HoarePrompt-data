Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer; `cards` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `count` is a Counter object containing counts of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the keys of `count`, sorted by their counts in ascending order. The counts of the two most frequent integers in `unique_numbers` are not both equal to `n // 2`.***
