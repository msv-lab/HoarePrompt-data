The variable `n` is reassigned the value from `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer input. Since `n` was initially a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), after this line is executed, `n` will still satisfy the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) but will now hold the specific value of the integer input provided. The list `A` is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3.**
