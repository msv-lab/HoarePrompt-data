The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers created by mapping the `input()` function to `int`, which splits the input string by spaces and converts each split string into an integer. The input will be a sequence of integers, and since `n` is defined as the length of the list `A`, `a` will contain exactly `n` integers which satisfy the constraints given for `a_i`. 

Therefore, the value of `A` will now be equal to `a`, which is a list of `n` integers based on the input, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer a_i is equal to the input values satisfying -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3; `a` is a list of `n` integers equal to the input values.**
