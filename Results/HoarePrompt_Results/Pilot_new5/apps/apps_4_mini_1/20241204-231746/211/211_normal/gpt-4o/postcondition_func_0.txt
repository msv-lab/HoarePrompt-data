The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `A` of `n` integers, where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. It calculates the sum of the elements in `A`. If the sum is not zero, it prints 'YES', followed by '1' and the value of `n`. If the sum is zero but at least one element in `A` is non-zero, it prints 'YES', followed by '2' and the indices of the first non-zero element and the end of the list. If all elements are zero, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints output based on the conditions.
