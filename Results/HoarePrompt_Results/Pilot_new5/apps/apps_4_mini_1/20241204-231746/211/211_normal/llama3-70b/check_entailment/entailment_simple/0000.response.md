Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Check for Zero Sum**: The condition `if (prefix_sum[n] == 0)` only checks if the total sum of the array is zero to print "NO". However, even if the total sum is not zero, the subarrays formed must also not have a sum of zero, which is not guaranteed by the current logic.

2. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program attempts to print segments of the array based on the prefix sum, but it does not ensure that each of these segments has a non-zero sum. It should check the sum of each subarray formed to ensure that it is not zero.

3. **Loop Logic Issues**: The logic used to define the segments only checks `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]`. This does not guarantee that the subarray from `l` to `r` has a non-zero sum; it only checks for specific conditions on prefix sums.

4. **Final Segment**: The final segment printed (from `l` to `n`) might also have a sum of zero if `prefix_sum[n]` is not handled correctly in relation to the segments formed previously.

Here's an example that highlights the problem:
- For the input `3` followed by `1 2 -3`, the total sum is zero. The program would print "NO", which is correct in this case. However, if we had `1 -1 0`, the total sum is zero, but the segments `1` and `-1` can be treated as valid splits since both are non-zero.

Given these points, the program fails to meet the complete requirements of the problem description. It incorrectly determines the possibility of valid splits based solely on the total sum and not the sums of individual or multiple segments.
