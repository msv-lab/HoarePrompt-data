According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `r` and the range defined by `n`. The loop is currently set to iterate over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `r` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `r` is 2, and since `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `r` needs to be increased by 1. This means `r` will become 3 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute again, it must still satisfy the condition that `r` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `r` is 3, `k` and `l` remain unchanged**
