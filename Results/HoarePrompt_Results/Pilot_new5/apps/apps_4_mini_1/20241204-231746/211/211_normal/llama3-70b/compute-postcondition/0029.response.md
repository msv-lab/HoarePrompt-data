The value of `k` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. The other variables `n`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `r` is 3; `k` is increased by 1; `l` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `r` is 3; `k` is increased by 1; `l` remains unchanged.**
