The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `A`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the contents of `A` are still valid, as all integers in the list satisfy the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `total_sum` is now equal to the sum of the integers in `A`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `A`.**
