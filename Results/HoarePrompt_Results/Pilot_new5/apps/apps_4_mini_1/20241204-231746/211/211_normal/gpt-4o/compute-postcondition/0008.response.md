According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and the loop iterates `n` times, it is crucial to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start from 0 and will go up to `n-1` during the iterations.

Given that `total_sum` is equal to 0, this means that the sum of the elements in the list `A` is 0, but this does not affect the ability of the loop to execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and that `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0**
