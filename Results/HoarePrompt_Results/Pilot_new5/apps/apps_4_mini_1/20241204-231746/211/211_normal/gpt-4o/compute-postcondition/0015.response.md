Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers within the range -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, and `total_sum` is 0. If `A[i]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed to the output along with '2 n', where `n` is the current value of `n`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
