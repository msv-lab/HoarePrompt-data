According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1]`, `i` is 2**
