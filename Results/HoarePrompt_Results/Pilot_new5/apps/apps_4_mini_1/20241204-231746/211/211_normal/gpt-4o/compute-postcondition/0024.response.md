The code prints 'YES', which does not update any variable values. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only impact is the output printed to the console. Therefore, the Output State remains the same for all variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers within the range -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, and `total_sum` is 0.**
