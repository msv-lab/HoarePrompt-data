The code snippet provided is `print(k, l, r)`, which outputs the values of the variables `k`, `l`, and `r`. However, the initial state only provides information about `n` and `r`, while the values for `k` and `l` are not defined in the initial state or the code snippet.

Since the values of `k` and `l` are unknown, we cannot determine their specific outputs. The variable `r` retains its value of 2, and the variable `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, but since `k` and `l` are not specified, we cannot include them in the output state.

Thus, the Output State will reflect what is known based on the initial conditions and the execution of the print statement, which outputs the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 2, `k` is unknown, `l` is unknown**
