Output State: **`k` is the count of values of `r` for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` is the last value of `r` for which the condition was met, `r` is equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. If the condition is never met, `k` remains 1 and `l` remains 1.**
