`A` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values split into separate strings. The list will consist of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies the condition -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an input that defines the size of the list `A`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000.**
