The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` evaluates to 3. The variable states remain unchanged as this statement only produces an output.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers within the range -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0, and '1 3' has been printed.**
