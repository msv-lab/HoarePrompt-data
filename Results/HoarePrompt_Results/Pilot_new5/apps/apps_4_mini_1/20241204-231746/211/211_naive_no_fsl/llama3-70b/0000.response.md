Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all cases correctly according to the problem description. 

1. **Case with All Non-Zero Elements**: If the input array contains multiple elements that sum to a non-zero total but can be split into subarrays whose individual sums equal zero, the program fails to detect that a valid partitioning is still possible. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   4
   2 3 -5 0
   ```
   The total sum is `0`, which would lead to the program outputting "NO", despite the fact that valid subarrays such as `[2 3]` and `[-5]` are possible.

2. **Edge Case of Multiple Valid Outputs**: The logic in the program to print the subarray indices does not clearly distinguish when a new valid subarray should start. For example:
   ```
   5
   1 2 3 -6 
   ```
   The program should be able to recognize that the first three elements can be a valid subarray and the last element can be another subarray. However, it mishandles the logic of starting new subarrays.

3. **Issues with Final Output**: The indices printed for the last subarray may not necessarily conform to the constraints outlined in the problem description when the sum of elements is zero at certain intermediate steps.

Due to these problems, the program does not guarantee correct output for all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
