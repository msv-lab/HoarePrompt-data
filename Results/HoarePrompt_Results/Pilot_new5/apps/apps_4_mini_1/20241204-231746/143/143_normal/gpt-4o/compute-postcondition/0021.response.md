The value of `current_cost` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`, where `i` is 30. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is defined for i in range(0, 31), `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is equal to `current_cost + dp[30]`, `i` is 30, and the value of `L` is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by `i` (L ≥ 2^30).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is defined for i in range(0, 31), `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is equal to `current_cost + dp[30]`, `i` is 30, and the value of `L` is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by `i` (L ≥ 2^30)**.
