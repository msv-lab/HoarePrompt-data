`current_cost` is updated by adding `dp[i]` to it. The initial value of `current_cost` remains unchanged, and the value of `dp[i]` is defined for i in the range from 0 to 30. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `current_cost` based on the addition of `dp[i]`. The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is defined for i in range(0, 31); `answer` is equal to min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[29]); `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[i]`.**
