#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; costs is a list of n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is min(10, c[i]) for i in range(n); `dp[i]` is 10 for i in range(n, 31); `c` is the list of costs.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `dp[i-1] * 2` for all `i` in the range from 1 to 30; `dp[0]` is min(10, c[0]); `dp[1]` is min(10, c[1]); `dp[2]` is min(10, c[2]); ... ; `dp[n]` is the minimum of its original value and `dp[n-1] * 2`; `dp[i]` for i in range(n+1, 31) remains 10.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is defined for i in range(0, 31); `answer` is the minimum value obtained during the loop execution or remains `max_cost` if the loop did not execute; `current_cost` is the total cost accumulated during the loop execution or remains 0 if the loop did not execute.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum value obtained during the loop execution or remains max_cost if the loop did not execute
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (representing the number of costs), a positive integer `L` (a limit), and a list of integers `costs` (containing costs). It calculates and returns the minimum total cost based on the given costs and the limit `L`, where costs can be doubled in each step, and returns a default maximum value (10^18) if no valid cost is found.
