According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `n`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `vol` is 1.**
