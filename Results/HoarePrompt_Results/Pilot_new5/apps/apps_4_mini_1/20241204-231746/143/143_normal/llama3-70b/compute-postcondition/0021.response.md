The variable `j` is assigned the value `n - 1`, and `vol` is updated to `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), the value of `j` will range from \(0\) to \(29\). Therefore, `vol` will be calculated as \(2^{(n-1)} - 1\), which will yield values ranging from \(0\) to \(2^{29} - 1\) based on the value of `n`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `dp[i]` is potentially updated during iterations, `vol` is `2**(n-1) - 1`.**
