According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, this implies that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is within the specified range, the loop can iterate `n` times.

At the start of the for loop, variable `i` is initialized to 0 and will increment by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, it is important to establish the current value of `i`.

In summary, to ensure the loop executes properly, we need to consider the following states:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
