To analyze the impact of the code on the program, we need to determine the value of `j` based on the initial state of `n`. Since it is given that `j` is `n + 1`, and `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`, we can infer that the range for `j` will be `2 ≤ j ≤ 31`. 

The code snippet provided is:
```
vol = 2 ** j - 1
```

This means that `vol` will be assigned the value of `2` raised to the power of `j`, minus `1`. Since `j` can have values from `2` to `31`, we can deduce the corresponding values for `vol`.

Now examining the implications:
- If `n = 1`, then `j = 2`, resulting in `vol = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`.
- If `n = 30`, then `j = 31`, resulting in `vol = 2 ** 31 - 1 = 2147483647`.

Thus, `vol` will take a value in the range from `3` to `2147483647` depending on the value of `n`.

The states of other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `i` is 2; `j` is `n + 1`; `vol` is an integer such that `vol` = 2 ** `j` - 1, ranging from 3 to 2147483647.**
