According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 1 and `i` will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `dp[1]` is now min(dp[1], c[1])**
