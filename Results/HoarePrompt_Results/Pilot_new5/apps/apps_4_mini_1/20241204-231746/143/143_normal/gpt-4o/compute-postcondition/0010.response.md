According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to 30. The loop can execute without any issues since there are no conditions that would prevent its execution as long as the setup before the loop is valid. The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches 30, and during that time, `dp` is initialized based on the conditions provided.

However, to ensure that the loop executes as intended, we need to focus on the initialization of `i` and the validity of any other relevant states.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is min(10, c[i]) for i in range(n), `dp[i]` is 10 for i in range(n, 31), `i` is 1**
