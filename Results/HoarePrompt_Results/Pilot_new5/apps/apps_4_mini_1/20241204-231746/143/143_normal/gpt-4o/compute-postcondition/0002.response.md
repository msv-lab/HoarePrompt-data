The variable `c` is assigned the value of `costs` followed by a list of `max_cost` repeated enough times to ensure `c` has a total length of 31. Given that `costs` is a list of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30), the length of `costs` can range from 1 to 30. Therefore, to make the total length of `c` equal to 31, we need to append `31 - n` occurrences of `max_cost` (which is 10) to `costs`.

If `n` is 30, then `c` will just be equal to `costs` with no additional elements. If `n` is 1, then `c` will be `costs` followed by 30 occurrences of 10.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; `max_cost` is 10; `dp` is a list of 31 integers, each equal to 10; `c` is a list consisting of `costs` followed by `10` repeated `31 - n` times.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; `max_cost` is 10; `dp` is a list of 31 integers, each equal to 10; `c` is a list consisting of `costs` followed by `10` repeated `31 - n` times.**
