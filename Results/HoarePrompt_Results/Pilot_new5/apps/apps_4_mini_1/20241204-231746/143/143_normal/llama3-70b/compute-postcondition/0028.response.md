Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `i` is 2; `j` is `n`; `vol` is equal to 2; if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[2]` is updated to be the minimum of `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + costs[n]`. There is no else part in the code.***
