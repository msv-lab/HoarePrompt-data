To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided information:

1. The variable `n` is an integer constrained to the range 1 to 30, which means it can take values from 1 to 30 inclusive. For the loop `for j in range(n):` to execute, `n` must be at least 1; since `n` is already stated to be within the range, this condition is satisfied.

2. The variable `i` is initialized to 2. However, the loop iterates over variable `j`, which is initialized to `n - 1`. The initialization of `j` suggests that it will take values ranging from 0 to `n - 1` depending on the value of `n`. The value of `j` must be updated in the loop as it iterates.

3. The state of `dp[i]` is mentioned to be potentially updated based on conditions during the first two iterations. This indicates some interaction with the loop's body but does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

4. The final value of `vol` is stated to be 2, but it appears that this variable does not directly impact whether the loop will be executed based on the information provided.

From this analysis, the key points are:

- The loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which is already the case.
- The initialization of `j` as `n - 1` is valid since it will adjust within the loop based on the structure of the loop.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `dp[i]` is potentially updated during iterations, and `vol` is 2. `j` starts at `n - 1` which is valid for the loop to execute.**
