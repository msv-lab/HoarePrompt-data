To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the `files` variable. The loop iterates over `files`, which is a list of tuples. For the loop to execute at least once, `files` must contain at least one element.

Given that `files` is currently a list, we should consider its contents. If `files` is empty, the loop will not execute. Additionally, the other variables (`n`, `examples`, and `regulars`) do not impact the execution of this loop, as they are not used in the loop itself.

Since `files` is mentioned to be a list of tuples, and in this case, it is empty, we need to modify its state to ensure it has at least one file (tuple) to iterate over.

Thus, the required state modifications are:
1. `files` must contain at least one tuple.
2. `examples` remains an empty list.
3. `regulars` remains an empty list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list**.
