Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the entry `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'` and includes `move {examples[i]} {i + 1}` if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`. In this case, `examples[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)`, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` plus 1 that was present in `files_set`, with `str(temp_counter)` not being in `files_set`. If `examples[i]` equals `str(i + 1)`, no changes occur to `moves`, `temp_counter`, or `examples[i]`.***
