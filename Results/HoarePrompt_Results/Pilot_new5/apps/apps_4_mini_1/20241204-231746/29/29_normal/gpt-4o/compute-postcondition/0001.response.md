The code initializes the variable `regulars` as an empty list. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. The previous values of `n`, `files`, and `examples` are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is an empty list, and `regulars` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list.**
