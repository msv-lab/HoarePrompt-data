In this case, `target` is assigned the value of `len(examples) + i + 1`. The value of `len(examples)` is the number of items in the `examples` list. The variable `i` has a value of `0`. Therefore, `target` becomes `len(examples) + 0 + 1`, which simplifies to `len(examples) + 1`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position, `regulars` is a list that must have at least 1 item, `moves` contains all the move operations performed during the loop, `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` that was not present in `files_set`, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`.**
