The code snippet `print(line)` outputs the value of `line`, but it does not change any variable. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order, `examples` is a list derived from `files`, `regular` must contain at least 1 element, `i` is len(examples) + len(regular) + 1, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `script` must contain at least 2 strings, and `line` is the next string in the script that has not yet been printed.**
