The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous condition states that `n` must be at least `temp_counter / 2`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. Since we do not have the initial value of `temp_counter`, we cannot determine its exact value after the increment. However, we can express the new value as `temp_counter + 1`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least `(temp_counter + 1) / 2` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`, `temp_counter` is increased by 1.**
