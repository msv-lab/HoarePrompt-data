The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, the new value of `temp_counter` remains greater than `2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this increment. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is now greater than `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is still not in `files_set`, `n` remains a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` still includes `examples[i]` as `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', and `moves` contains the previous entries and now includes `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter + 1}'`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` remains a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` now includes `examples[i]` as `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the previous entries and now includes `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter + 1}'`.**
