The code appends the variable `name` to the list `regulars`. Since `regulars` was initially an empty list, after executing the code, it will now contain the value of `name`. The values of `n`, `files`, and `examples` remain unchanged, and `type_` is still not equal to '1'. Therefore, the Output State reflects these updates.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` contains the value of `name`, `name` and `type_` are obtained from splitting the string `file` into two parts, and `type_` is not equal to '1'.**
