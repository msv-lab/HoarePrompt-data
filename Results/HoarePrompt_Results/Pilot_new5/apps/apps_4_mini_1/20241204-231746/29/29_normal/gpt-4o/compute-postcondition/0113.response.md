`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was greater than `2 * n`, meaning the new value of `temp_counter` will still satisfy this condition. The states of the other variables are not affected, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` has a new entry 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}' with the updated value of `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` has a new entry 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter + 1}'**.
