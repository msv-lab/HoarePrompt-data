The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n`, the new value of `temp_counter` will range from 2 to `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is between 2 and `2 * n + 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is between 2 and `2 * n + 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set**.
