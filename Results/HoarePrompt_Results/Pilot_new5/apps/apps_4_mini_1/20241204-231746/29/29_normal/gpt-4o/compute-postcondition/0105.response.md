The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer, and `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. The condition that `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` with `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
