According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `n`, as well as whether `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. For the loop to execute again, both conditions must be satisfied: `temp_counter` should be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, and it has been incremented by 1. This means that the new value of `temp_counter` after the increment is now less than or equal to `2 * n`, so that part of the condition is satisfied.

However, since `temp_counter` was incremented by 1, we need to ensure that the new value of `temp_counter` still satisfies the second part of the condition: `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. 

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state for `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1, and str(temp_counter) must be in files_set**
