The code creates a new list called `examples` that contains the first item of each tuple in `files` where the second item of the tuple is equal to 1. Given that `files` is sorted by the second item in descending order, the only tuples included in `examples` are those where the second item is exactly 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order; `examples` is a list of the first items of the tuples in `files` where the second item is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order; `examples` is a list of the first items of the tuples in `files` where the second item is 1.**
