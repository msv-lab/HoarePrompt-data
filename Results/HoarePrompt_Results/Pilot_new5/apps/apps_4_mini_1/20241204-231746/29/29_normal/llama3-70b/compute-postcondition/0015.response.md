The variable `script` is assigned an empty list. This does not affect the values of other variables, which retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regular`, but it now includes the updated state for `script`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order; `examples` is a list of the first items of the tuples in `files` where the second item is 1; `regular` is a list of the first items of the tuples in `files` where the second item is 0; `script` is an empty list.**
