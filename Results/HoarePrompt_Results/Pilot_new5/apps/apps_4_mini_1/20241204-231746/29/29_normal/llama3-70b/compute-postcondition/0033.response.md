According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more strings in the `script` list. At the end of the last iteration, `script` contains at least 1 string, and `line` is printed. If `script` had `m` strings at the start of the last iteration, after printing the last `line`, there will be `m - 1` strings left in `script`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `script` must contain at least 2 strings. Therefore, the updated state should reflect that `line` will now refer to the next string in `script`, and the length of `script` should be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order, `examples` is a list derived from `files`, `regular` must contain at least 1 element, `i` is len(examples) + len(regular), `file` is the last element in `regular`, `script` must contain at least 2 strings, and line is the next string in the script.**
