The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it's stated that `temp_counter` must be adjusted to a value less than or equal to `2 * n`, we know that after this operation, `temp_counter` will still satisfy that condition. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position, `regulars` is a list that must have at least 1 item, `moves` contains all the move operations performed during the loop, `temp_counter` is adjusted to a value less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1, and `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.**
