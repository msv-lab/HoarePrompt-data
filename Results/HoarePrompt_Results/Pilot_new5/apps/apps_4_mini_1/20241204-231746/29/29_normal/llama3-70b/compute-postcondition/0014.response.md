`regular` is assigned a list comprehension that extracts the first items from the tuples in `files` where the second item is equal to 0. The initial state of `files` and `examples` remain unchanged, while `regular` will now hold the first items of those tuples with the second item of 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order; `examples` is a list of the first items of the tuples in `files` where the second item is 1; `regular` is a list of the first items of the tuples in `files` where the second item is 0.**
