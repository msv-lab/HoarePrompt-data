According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, with the variable `_` taking values from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` would be `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain the same, but `_` will be incremented to `n`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list containing one tuple (name, int(type_)), _ is n**
