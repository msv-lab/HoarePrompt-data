In this case, the `files` list is updated to append a new tuple containing `name` and `int(type_)`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation, and the previous elements in the `files` list are preserved along with the newly added tuple.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is the previous list of elements plus the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`.**
