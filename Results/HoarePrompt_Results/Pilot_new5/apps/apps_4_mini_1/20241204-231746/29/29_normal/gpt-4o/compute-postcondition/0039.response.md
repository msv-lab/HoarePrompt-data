To determine what adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least one time, we need to analyze the conditions laid out in the `while` loop.

The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` **and** `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

1. **Analyzing `temp_counter`**: We know from the given state that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`. Therefore, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n` for the loop to execute. This means we should set `temp_counter` to a value that is less than or equal to `2 * n`.

2. **Analyzing `files_set`**: The variable `files_set` is not explicitly given in the state, but it is implied that it should contain `str(temp_counter)` for the loop to execute. However, since we are focusing on the adjustment of `temp_counter`, we will assume that `files_set` could potentially contain the necessary string representation of `temp_counter` once it is adjusted. 

Based on the above analysis, the only necessary adjustment is to modify `temp_counter` so that it is less than or equal to `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the entry `f'move {examples[len(examples) - 1]} {temp_counter}'`, temp_counter must be less than or equal to `2 * n`**
