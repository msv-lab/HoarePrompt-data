Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here is a breakdown of how the program meets the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of files. It then collects `n` tuples consisting of a filename and its associated type (either "0" for regular test or "1" for example test). This matches the input specification provided in the problem description.

2. **File Separation**: The program sorts the files based on their type, separating them into two lists: `examples` for the example tests and `regular` for regular tests. This ensures that all example test files are grouped together, as required by the problem description.

3. **Command Generation**: The program generates the move commands based on the order of the files:
   - First, it assigns the filenames of the example tests to the sequence "1", "2", ..., "e" (where `e` is the number of examples).
   - Then, it assigns the filenames of the regular tests to the sequence "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n" (where `n` is the total number of files).
   
   This fulfills the requirement that all examples should be renamed to the first several tests and all regular tests should follow consecutively without gaps.

4. **Output Format**: Finally, the program prints the total number of move commands followed by each command. This output format aligns with what the problem description specifies.

The logic and steps taken in the code ensure that it covers all edge cases:
- It can handle cases with no example tests and cases where all tests are examples.
- The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct, which prevents any issues with overwriting files incorrectly.

Thus, the implementation is correct and fulfills the problem requirements for every valid input case within the specified constraints.
