The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains at least `(temp_counter + 1) / 2`, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `temp_counter`. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least `(temp_counter + 1) / 2`, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`, `temp_counter` is increased by 1.**
