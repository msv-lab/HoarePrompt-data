To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute again, we need to analyze the conditions stated in the `while` loop.

The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - Since `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, its current value is greater than its previous value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` does not exceed `2 * n`. 
   - So, if `temp_counter` was previously equal to `2 * n`, we must adjust `n` to be such that `temp_counter` can still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Thus, we must ensure that `n` is at least `temp_counter / 2`.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - This condition checks if the string representation of `temp_counter` exists in `files_set`. As `temp_counter` increments, it is possible that its string representation may no longer be present in `files_set`, meaning we need to ensure that it exists for the loop to execute again.

Putting this together, we find that:
- We need to ensure `n` is at least `temp_counter / 2`.
- We need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` exists in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` has been incremented and we do not know its previous value, we can only infer that adjustments should be made based on these two conditions.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are:

State: **`n` must be at least `temp_counter / 2` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in files_set**
