The code appends a formatted string to the list `moves`. The string includes `regulars[i]` and the current value of `temp_counter`, but does not alter any of the initial state variables. The initial conditions remain unchanged, and the `moves` list is updated with a new entry. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and `moves` has a new entry 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'**.
