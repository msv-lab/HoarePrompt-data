The `script` list is modified by appending a new string formatted with the values of `file` and `i`. The `file` variable holds the third item from the `examples` list. The value of `i` is 3. Therefore, the new string added to `script` will be `f'move {file} {i}'`, which resolves to `move {third_item_of_examples} 3`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will include all the relevant unchanged variables and will update the `script` list to include the new element.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order; `examples` is a list of examples that must have at least 3 elements; `script` now contains three elements: the original element, `'move {second_item_of_examples} 2'`, and `'move {third_item_of_examples} 3'`; `i` is 3; `file` is the third item in `examples`.**
