The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, it will now be `temp_counter + 1`, and also, `str(temp_counter + 1)` must still be in `files_set`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`.**
