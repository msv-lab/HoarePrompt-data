The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n`, which implies that after the increment, `temp_counter` will still be valid as long as it was originally less than `2 * n - 1`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n`, and `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n`, `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1.**
