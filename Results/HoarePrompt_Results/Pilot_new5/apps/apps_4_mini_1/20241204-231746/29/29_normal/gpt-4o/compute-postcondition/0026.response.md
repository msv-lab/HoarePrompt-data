According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `files_set`. The loop will continue to run as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` is present in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string form of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, its current value will be `temp_counter - 1`. To ensure the loop executes again, we must make sure that the new `temp_counter` (which will be `temp_counter` in the next iteration) is still less than or equal to `2 * n`, and that the condition `str(temp_counter)` is satisfied.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `temp_counter` after increment remains less than or equal to `2 * n`, which implies `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, and we also need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, and str(temp_counter) must be in files_set**
