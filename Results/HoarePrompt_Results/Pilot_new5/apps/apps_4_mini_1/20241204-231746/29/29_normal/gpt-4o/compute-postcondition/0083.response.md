Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` contains the updated names of files of type '1' corresponding to their final position, `regulars` is a list that contains at least one item, `moves` contains all the move operations performed during the loop, `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` that was not present in `files_set`, `i` is 0, and `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`. The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, so `regulars[0]` is set to `str(temp_counter)`, `moves` includes the operation `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}`, and `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.***
