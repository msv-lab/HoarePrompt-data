To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions set in the loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`. 

1. **Evaluate `temp_counter`**: 
   - We know that `temp_counter` is currently greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n`. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must still satisfy the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` is already less than or equal to `2 * n`, this condition is satisfied.

2. **Evaluate `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**: 
   - This condition checks if the string representation of `temp_counter` exists in `files_set`. Since we do not have information on the specific content of `files_set`, we can't determine if `str(temp_counter)` is in it or not. However, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.

Given that `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n`, and without any specific information about the `files_set`, we can infer that we might need to adjust the presence of `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set` to ensure that the loop can proceed.

Thus, we need to state that `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Based on this reasoning:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**.
