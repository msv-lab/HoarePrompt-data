The code appends a new entry to the `moves` list. The entry is formatted as a string, combining the current `examples[i]` and the value of `i + 1`. The value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, which means the new entry will be unique and will not duplicate an existing entry in `moves`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` now includes `examples[i]` as `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the previous entries and now includes `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`, and the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`.**
