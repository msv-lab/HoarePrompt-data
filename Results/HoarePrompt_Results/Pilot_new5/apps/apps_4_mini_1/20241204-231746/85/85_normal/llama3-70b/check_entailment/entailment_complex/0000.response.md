The provided program attempts to solve the problem of counting pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. However, upon reviewing the logic within the `func()` function, it appears that the implementation does not align with the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Understanding Pair Sums**: The problem requires counting pairs of shovels `(i, n - i)`, where `i` ranges from `1` to `n // 2`. The goal is to find pairs whose sum ends with the maximum number of trailing nines. The conditions under which the sum `i + (n - i)` meets this requirement are incorrectly handled.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Trailing Nines**: The condition used in the code:
   ```python
   if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
   ```
   aims to check if the sum is divisible by its highest place value. However, this does not correctly check for the number of trailing nines. In fact, to check for trailing nines, one should check if the total sum modulo `10` equals `9`, `90`, `900`, etc., depending on the trailing nines count.

3. **Count of Compliant Pairs**: The loop simply counts how many times the condition is satisfied, which does not correspond to the distinct pairs of shovels that produce a maximum number of trailing nines. The description specifies that pairs are considered different if they involve different shovels, but the implementation does not accurately capture this.

4. **Lack of Handling for Maximum Trailing Nines Calculation**: The program fails to correctly find the maximum number of trailing nines for any given `n`, since it does not first determine what that maximum would be before counting pairs. This is crucial for solving the problem as stated.

In conclusion, the code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description as it neither correctly identifies the maximum number of trailing nines nor accurately counts the pairs that yield this max result. 

Hence, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
