According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `(n + 1) % 10` must be equal to 0. Currently, `n` is 0, which means `(0 + 1) % 10` evaluates to 1, not 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to a value such that `(n + 1) % 10` equals 0. This occurs when `n` is equal to 9.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 2**
