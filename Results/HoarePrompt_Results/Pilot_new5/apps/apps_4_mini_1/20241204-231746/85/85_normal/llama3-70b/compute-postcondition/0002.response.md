According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute for the range from 1 to `n // 2`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2, allowing `n // 2` to be at least 1. 

Also, before the loop starts, `i` will be initialized to 1 at the beginning of the first iteration, and `ans` remains 0 until modified within the loop body.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be within the provided bounds (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9), and `i` starts at 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
