The variable `n` is assigned the value from `int(input())`, which takes user input and converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), but the exact value of `n` is unknown due to the input function. Thus, after execution, `n` retains its integer type but will now hold the value of whatever input is provided, as long as it remains within the specified bounds.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with the value from user input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
