In the given code, `pairs` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) * max_9s`. The variable `n` is initially 0, so the expression `(n + 1)` evaluates to `1`. The value of `max_9s` is defined as the number of consecutive 9s at the end of the original value of `n`. Since `n` is 0, there are no consecutive 9s, which means `max_9s` is `0`. Therefore, the calculation for `pairs` becomes `(0 + 1) * 0`, which evaluates to `0`.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows: `n` remains `0`, `max_9s` remains `0`, and `pairs` is now `0`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is 0, `pairs` is 0**.
