The value of `reachable` is explicitly set to `True`, indicating that the condition for being reachable has been satisfied. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos + k`, and `reachable` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos + k`, and `reachable` is True.**
