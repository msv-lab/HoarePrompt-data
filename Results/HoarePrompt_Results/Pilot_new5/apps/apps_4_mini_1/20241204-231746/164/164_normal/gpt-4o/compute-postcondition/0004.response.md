Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line`. The current value of `G_pos` is greater than the current value of `T_pos`.***
