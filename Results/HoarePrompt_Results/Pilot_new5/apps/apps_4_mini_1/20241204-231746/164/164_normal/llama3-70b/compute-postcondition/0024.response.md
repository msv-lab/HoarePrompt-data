Postcondition: ***`g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in string `s`, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in string `s`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, and `s` is an input string. Both 'G' and 'T' appear in `s`, thus `g` is greater than or equal to 0 and `t` is greater than or equal to 0.***
