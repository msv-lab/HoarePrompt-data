Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True if `pos` is equal to `T_pos`, and `pos` is set to both `G_pos` and `T_pos`. If the character at index `pos` in `line` is '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
