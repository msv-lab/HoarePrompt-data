The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos + k`, and `reachable` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
