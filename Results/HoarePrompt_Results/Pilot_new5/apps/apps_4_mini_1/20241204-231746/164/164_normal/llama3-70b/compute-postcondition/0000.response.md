The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input()` after it is split and converted to integers. The constraints state that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The exact values of `n` and `k` are dependent on the input provided, but they still adhere to their respective constraints. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` have been updated with the input values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and `n`, `k` are now assigned input integer values.**
