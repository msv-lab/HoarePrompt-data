The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, and `pos` is initialized to `G_pos` and equal to `T_pos`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
