According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already defined as an integer within the range of 2 to 100, the loop can execute for the values of `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1`. 

The state of `i` before the loop starts is essential to note, as it will be initialized to 0 when the loop begins its first iteration. The other variables `k`, `s`, `g`, and `t` don't influence the loop execution itself but can be tracked if needed for the loop's logic or body.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; hence it allows for multiple iterations.
- `i` will start at 0 when the loop executes.

In conclusion, the state can be represented as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is -1, `i` is 0**
