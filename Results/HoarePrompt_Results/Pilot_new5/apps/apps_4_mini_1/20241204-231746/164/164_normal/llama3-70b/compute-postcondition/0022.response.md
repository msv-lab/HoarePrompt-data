Postcondition: ***`g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in string `s`, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in string `s`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, and `s` is an input string. The current value of `g` is -1 or the current value of `t` is -1, indicating that either 'G' or 'T' do not appear in `s`.***
