The variable `t` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial value of `i` is 0. Therefore, `t` becomes 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0**
