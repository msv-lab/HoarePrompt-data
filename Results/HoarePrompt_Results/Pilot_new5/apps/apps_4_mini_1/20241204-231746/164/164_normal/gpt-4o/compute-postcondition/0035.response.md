Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` (length of the string) and an integer `k` (step size) from input, followed by a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. It determines if the character 'G' can reach 'T' by moving in steps of `k` without encountering a '#' character in between. If 'G' can reach 'T', it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function assumes that 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string. **
