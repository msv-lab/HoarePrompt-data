Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the grasshopper is unable to reach the target insect due to obstacles beyond the initial jump. Specifically, if 'G' is to the left of 'T' and there are obstacles to the right of 'G' that block all potential jumps, the program will incorrectly report "YES". 

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
7 2
G##T###
```
Here, the grasshopper 'G' is at index 0 and the insect 'T' is at index 3. The grasshopper can only jump to indices 2 (which is '#') and thus cannot ever reach 'T', but the program will incorrectly state "YES" because it doesn't check for obstacles after the initial jump to index 2.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases and is deemed incorrect.
