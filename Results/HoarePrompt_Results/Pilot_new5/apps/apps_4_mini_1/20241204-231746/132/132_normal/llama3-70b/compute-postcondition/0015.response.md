Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` non-negative integers. It checks if the sums of the elements in `x` and `y` are equal. If the sums are not equal, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it then checks if the sorted versions of `x` and `y` are identical, printing 'Yes' if they are and 'No' if they are not. The function does not return any value; it simply prints the results based on the comparisons. **
