The code executes a print statement, which does not change any variable values. The variables retain their previous states, and the output of the print statement is implied rather than stored as a variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers each satisfying 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers that are non-negative and are the result of mapping `int` over input values; `total_x` is equal to `sum(x)`; `total_y` is equal to `sum(y)`; the current value of `total_y` is greater than `total_x`; 'No' has been printed.**
