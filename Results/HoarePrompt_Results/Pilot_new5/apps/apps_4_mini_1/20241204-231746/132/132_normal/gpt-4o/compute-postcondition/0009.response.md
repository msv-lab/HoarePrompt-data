Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers each satisfying 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers that are non-negative and are the result of mapping `int` over input values; `total_x` is equal to `sum(x)`; `total_y` is equal to `sum(y)`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, if `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, 'Yes' is printed to the console.***
