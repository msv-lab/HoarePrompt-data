The statement `min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)` updates the value of `min_speed`. The new value of `min_speed` will be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. 

The initial state does not specify the exact values of `min_speed`, `d`, or `max_speed`, but we know the following:

- `min_speed` is updated based on its previous value increased by `d`, and compared with `max_speed`.
- The other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `max_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects the update to `min_speed`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 3, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to its previous value plus `max_speed`, `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.**
