The code calculates the total distance based on the speeds array, which has been previously updated. The variable `total_distance` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the `speeds` array. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`speeds[i]` for `i` from 1 to `t-1` is updated based on the formula `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`; `speeds[0]` is `v_1`; `speeds[t-1]` is `v_2`; `t` is between 2 and 100; `d` is between 0 and 10; `total_distance` is the sum of elements in `speeds`.**
