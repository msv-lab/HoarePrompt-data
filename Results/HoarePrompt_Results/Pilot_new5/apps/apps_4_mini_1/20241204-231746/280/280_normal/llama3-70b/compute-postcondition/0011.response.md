To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to closely examine the for loop statement and the provided variables at the end of the last iteration.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
```
This means that the loop initializes `i` to `t - 1`, and will continue to execute while `i` is greater than `0`, decrementing `i` by `1` after each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `v_1` is an integer (remains unchanged)
- `v_2` is an integer (remains unchanged)
- `t` must be at least `2`
- `d` is an integer (remains unchanged)
- `max_speed` is calculated as `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`
- `max_length` is calculated as `max_speed * (t + 1)`
- `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`
- `i` is `t - 1`
- `min_speed` is calculated as `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`

In the last iteration, `i` was `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to decrement `i`, which means in the next iteration, `i` will become:
- `i = (t - 1) - 1 = t - 2`

For the loop to execute again, `i` must remain greater than `0`. Therefore, we need:
- `t - 2` > 0, which implies `t` must be greater than `2`.

Now, summarizing the state adjustments for the next iteration:
- `v_1` remains unchanged
- `v_2` remains unchanged
- `t` must still be at least `2` (for the loop to have a valid starting point)
- `d` remains unchanged
- `max_speed` remains as calculated
- `max_length` remains as calculated
- `min_length` remains as calculated
- `i` is now `t - 2`
- `min_speed` remains unchanged

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration will be:

State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is equal to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * (t + 1)`, `min_length` is equal to its previous value plus `min_speed`, `i` is `t - 2`, and `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`**
