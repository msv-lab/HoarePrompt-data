`min_speed` is assigned the value of the minimum between `v_1` and `v_2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, and `max_speed`, along with the newly calculated `min_speed`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `v_2` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer representing the maximum speed change per second; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`.**
