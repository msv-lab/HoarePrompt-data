Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is equal to `max(max_speed - d * (t - 1), min_speed)`, `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d * (t - 1), max_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to its original value plus `(t - 1) * max_speed`, `min_length` is equal to its original value plus `(t - 1) * min_speed`, and `max_length` is printed.**
