According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` is at its maximum value of 1 (since the range starts at 1 and stops before `t`). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 2, and `i` will be incremented to 2.

State: **`speeds[1]` is updated, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2**
