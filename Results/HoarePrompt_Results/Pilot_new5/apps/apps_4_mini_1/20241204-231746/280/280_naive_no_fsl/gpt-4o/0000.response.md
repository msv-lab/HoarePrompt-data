To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic step by step.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` correctly from the input.

2. **Initialization of Speeds**: It initializes a list `speeds` of size `t`, setting the first element to `v1` and the last element to `v2`. This is in accordance with the problem statement.

3. **Speed Calculation Loop**: The loop that fills in the speeds array is intended to satisfy the condition that the speed between each second changes by at most `d`. However, the formula used to set `speeds[i]` is:
   ```python
   speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
   ```
   Here, the second term aims to ensure that the maximum possible speed doesn't exceed the time left multiplied by `d`, which is a valid approach. However, it doesn't account properly for ensuring that you can reach `v2` by the end of `t`.

4. **Potential Failure Case**: Consider the following case:
   ```
   Input:
   1 100
   100 1
   ```
   In this case:
   - `v1 = 1`
   - `v2 = 100`
   - `t = 100`
   - `d = 1`

   The program would attempt to set the speeds as follows:
   - `speeds[0] = 1`
   - As it fills in the array, it will add `d` of 1 to `speeds[i-1]` for each step until it reaches `speeds[99]`, which will result in only gradually increasing speeds. However, this method will not be enough to allow a smooth transition to reach `v2` (100) since it can only increment by 1 every second and would reach at most 100 after 100 seconds but won't account for the initial speed of 1.

5. **Conclusion**: The program will fail to provide the correct maximum distance in this case and possibly other edge cases where `d` is small compared to the difference between `v2` and `v1`. 

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential inputs outlined in the problem description, specifically where the speed must increase significantly to meet `v2` with limited increments.

Correctness: **False**
