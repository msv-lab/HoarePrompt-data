The code provided is designed to compare two numbers represented in a custom "golden system" where numbers are expressed as strings of '0's and '1's. The code calculates the decimal value of these strings based on the golden ratio `q`, which is defined as \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).

Let's analyze the code and problem description step by step.

1. **Functionality of the Code**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` computes the decimal value of the binary-like string `s` using the formula for the golden system: \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i} \). 
   - The code compares the decimal values of the two input strings \( a \) and \( b \) and prints the appropriate comparison symbol ('>', '<', or '=').

2. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - The key edge case lies in the handling of invalid characters. The problem states that the input consists of non-empty strings containing only '0's and '1's. However, the code does not have validation checks to ensure that the input strings indeed contain only these characters. If any character other than '0' or '1' is present, it would raise a ValueError when attempting to convert it to an integer with `int(c)`.
   - Additionally, the code does not handle leading zeros in any specific manner, but this does not affect the calculation since leading zeros do not contribute to the decimal value.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints incorrectly describe the function as accepting a tuple of strings and concatenating them, which does not match the code. The function actually takes a single string at a time.
   - The hints correctly mention that the function computes the weighted sum of the characters using the golden ratio, but they also raise a concern regarding invalid characters not being checked, which is a valid point and highlights a flaw in the code.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The code does not account for invalid input, which violates the requirement that the input should consist only of '0's and '1's. If invalid characters were provided, the code would fail with an error, demonstrating that it does not handle every potential input case as required by the problem description.

Given these observations, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
