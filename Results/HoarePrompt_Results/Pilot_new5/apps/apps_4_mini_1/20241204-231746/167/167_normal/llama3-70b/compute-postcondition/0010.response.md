Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is (new_v - 1) // y, `py` is (new_v - 1) % y, `v` is the second element of `a`, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, and `ny` is (v - 1) % y. If the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no specified output from the else part.***
