#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and the list of integers a contains n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    px, py = 0, 0
    for v in a:
        nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
        
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        
        px, py = nx, ny
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is (last element of `a` - 1) // y, `py` is (last element of `a` - 1) % y, the absolute distance condition was satisfied for all elements in `a`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the absolute distance condition was satisfied for all elements in list 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `x` and `y`, and checks a list of integers `a`. It calculates the coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on the values in `a` and verifies if the movement from one coordinate to another has an absolute distance of exactly 1. If this condition is satisfied for all elements in `a`, the function returns `True`. If any element fails the condition, it returns `False`. The function does not utilize `x` in its calculations, which suggests that it might be unnecessary for the current implementation.
