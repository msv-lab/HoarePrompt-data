Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `px` is now equal to `nx`; `py` is now equal to `ny`; `v` is the third element of `a`; `nx` is (v - 1) // y; `ny` is (v - 1) % y. If the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px)` and `abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. If this condition is not met, the function proceeds without any return statement.***
