Postcondition: ***`right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` remain unchanged. If `left_count[i]` equals `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` equals `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` equals `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` equals `cnt_b`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `target_sofa` is set to `i + 2`, and `d` is greater than `i + 1`, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
