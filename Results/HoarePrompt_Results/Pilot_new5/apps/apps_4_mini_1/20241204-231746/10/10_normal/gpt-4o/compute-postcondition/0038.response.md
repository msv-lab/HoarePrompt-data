The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of `d`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
