Postcondition: ***`right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` are counts of sofas in their respective directions. If the current value of `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, the value of `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, the value of `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, and the value of `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, then `target_sofa` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
