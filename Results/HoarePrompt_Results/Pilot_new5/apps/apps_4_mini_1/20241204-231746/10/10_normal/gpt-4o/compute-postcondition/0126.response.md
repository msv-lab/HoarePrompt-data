The `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of a loop is to be skipped, and the next iteration will commence. However, it does not change any variable values or states. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes have occurred in the variable states.

Output State: **`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, `y2` is less than `y1_j`, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `d` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged.**
