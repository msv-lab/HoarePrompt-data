The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa` and `sofas`. The parameter `sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas, where each sofa is defined by four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2). The parameter `sofas` is an integer representing the number of sofas. The function processes these parameters to count the number of sofas positioned to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa based on their coordinates in the 2D list `sofa`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2D list of integer coordinates for sofas and an integer count of sofas, and return the counts of sofas positioned to the left, right, top, and bottom relative to Grandpa Maks's sofa. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list of integers `sofa` representing sofa coordinates and an integer `sofas` representing the number of sofas, returns counts of sofas positioned to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa based on their coordinates.**
