The variable `d` is assigned the value `int(input().strip())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. Other variables such as `n`, `m`, and the coordinates of the sofas are not affected by this line of code at this moment, so their previous state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer representing the number of sofas, where 1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^5; `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the storehouse, where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5; each of the next `d` lines contains four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) representing the coordinates of the sofas; and the last line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b), where 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ `d` - 1; `d` is now an input integer.**
