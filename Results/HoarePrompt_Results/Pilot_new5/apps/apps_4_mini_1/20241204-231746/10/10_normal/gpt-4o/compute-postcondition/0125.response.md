According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. The loop will execute again if `d` is greater than the current value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `d` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must still be greater than 1. The value of `j` would then be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, `y2` is less than `y1_j`, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `d` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged.**
