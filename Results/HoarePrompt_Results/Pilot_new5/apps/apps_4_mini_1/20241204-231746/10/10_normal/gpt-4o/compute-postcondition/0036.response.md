Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is also greater than `y2_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` and `top_count[i]` are both increased by 1. If the condition is not met, `bottom_count[i]` and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
