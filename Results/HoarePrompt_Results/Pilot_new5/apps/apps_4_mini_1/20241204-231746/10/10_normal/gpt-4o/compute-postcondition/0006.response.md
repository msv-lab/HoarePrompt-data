According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` must be greater than or equal to 1, indicating that it was at least 1 during the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` would need to be decremented by 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be greater than or equal to 2 after the current iteration. The other states (`n`, `m`, and `sofas`) do not need to change as they are not directly affected by the loop's execution.

State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
