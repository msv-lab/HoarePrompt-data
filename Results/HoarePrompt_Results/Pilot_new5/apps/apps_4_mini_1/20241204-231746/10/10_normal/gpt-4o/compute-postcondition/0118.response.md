Postcondition: ***If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, `left_count[i]` becomes `left_count[i] + 1`, while `bottom_count[i]` and `top_count[i]` retain their previous values. Additionally, `d` remains greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged. If the condition is not met, no changes occur in the counts or the other variables.***
