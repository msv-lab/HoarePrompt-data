The variable `left_count` is assigned a list that contains `d` elements, all initialized to 0. The states of the other variables, including `d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer representing the number of sofas, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are assigned values from input as integers, and `left_count` is a list of zeros with a length of `d`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer representing the number of sofas; `n` is an integer; `m` is an integer; `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of integers; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are assigned values from input as integers; `left_count` is a list of zeros with a length of `d`.**
