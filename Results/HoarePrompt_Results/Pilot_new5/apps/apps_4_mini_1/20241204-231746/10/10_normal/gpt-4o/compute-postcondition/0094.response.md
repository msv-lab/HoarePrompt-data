The statement `continue` causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the values of `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, and the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain unchanged, and `j` is still equal to `d`. Therefore, no variables have been modified.

Output State: **`right_count[i]` is unchanged, `left_count[i]` is unchanged, `bottom_count[i]` is unchanged, `top_count[i]` is unchanged, `j` is `d`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain unchanged; we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
