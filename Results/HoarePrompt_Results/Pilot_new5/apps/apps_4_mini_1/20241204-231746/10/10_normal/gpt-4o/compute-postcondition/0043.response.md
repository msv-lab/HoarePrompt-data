The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, so `left_count[0]` is the variable being updated. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`, and `left_count[0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`, `left_count[0]` is increased by 1.**
