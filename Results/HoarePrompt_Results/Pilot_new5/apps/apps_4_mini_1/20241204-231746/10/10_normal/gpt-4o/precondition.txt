d is a positive integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the storehouse (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5), and each of the next d lines contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of each sofa (1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m) with (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) being adjacent cells. The last line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) where 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1.
