Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` are modified based on the conditions. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `top_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, both `right_count[i]` and `bottom_count[i]` are increased by 1. Otherwise, only `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, leaving `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` unchanged, with `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remaining unchanged.***
