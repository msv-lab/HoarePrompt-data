Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, the assignment to `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` does not occur because `i` equals `j`, the current values of `x1` and `x2` are both greater than `x2_j`, and `right_count[0]` has been increased by 1.***
