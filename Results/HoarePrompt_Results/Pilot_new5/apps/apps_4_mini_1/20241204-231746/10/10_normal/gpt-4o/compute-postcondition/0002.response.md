The variable `sofas` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `d`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `sofas` is now an empty list, while `d`, `n`, and `m` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`d` is an integer representing the number of sofas, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `sofas` is an empty list.**
