According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` must be greater than or equal to 2, allowing for the possibility of executing the loop a second time. Since the loop iterates `d` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be at least 3. The variable `_` is not used within the loop, so it does not affect the state.

State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 3; `n` is an integer; `m` is an integer; `sofas` is a list containing tuples, now including an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
