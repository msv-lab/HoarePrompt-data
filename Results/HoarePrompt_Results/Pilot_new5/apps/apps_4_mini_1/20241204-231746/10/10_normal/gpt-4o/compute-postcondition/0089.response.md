Output State: **`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` remain unchanged; `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `right_count[i]` and `bottom_count[i]` are increased by 1, otherwise `right_count[i]` is increased by 1 while `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged. `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged.**
