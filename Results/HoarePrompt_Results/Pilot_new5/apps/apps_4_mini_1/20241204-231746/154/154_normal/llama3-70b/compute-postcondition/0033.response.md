Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp` has been fully updated for all `j` from 1 to `M`, with `dp[k + 1][j]` representing the maximum number of items that can be selected from the first `k` items with a total weight of `j`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[k - 1]`, then `dp[k + 1][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[k + 1][j]` and `dp[k][j - t[k - 1]] + 1`.**
