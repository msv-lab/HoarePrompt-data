Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer `t[j + 1]` is such that 1 ≤ `t[j + 1]` ≤ 1000000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `complete_tasks` is incremented by 1; `time_used` remains the same as before; if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
