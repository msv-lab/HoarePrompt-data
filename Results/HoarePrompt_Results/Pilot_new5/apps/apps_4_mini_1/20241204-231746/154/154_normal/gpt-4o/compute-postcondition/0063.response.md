Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `t` is a non-empty iterable, and the current value of `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.***
