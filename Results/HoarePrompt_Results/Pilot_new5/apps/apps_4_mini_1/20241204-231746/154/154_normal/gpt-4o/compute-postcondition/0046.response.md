Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `subtask_time` is the next value in `t`; if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time * subtask_time)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.***
