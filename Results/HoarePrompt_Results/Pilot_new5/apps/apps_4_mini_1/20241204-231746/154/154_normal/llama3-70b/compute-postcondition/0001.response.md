The list `t` is assigned the values obtained from the input, where the input consists of space-separated integers. Each integer is converted from string format to integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The number of integers in `t` will be equal to `k`, as stated in the initial conditions. The initial values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (new value from input), `k` is an integer (new value from input), `M` is a non-negative integer (new value from input), `t` is a list of k integers obtained from input.**
