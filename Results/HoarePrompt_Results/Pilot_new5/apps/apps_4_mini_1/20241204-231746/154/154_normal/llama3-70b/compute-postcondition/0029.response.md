According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from 1 to M (inclusive). The variable `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each iteration until it reaches M, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was equal to `M`, therefore one more iteration would increase `j` to `M + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must reach `M + 1`, but since the loop condition is `j < M + 1`, it will not execute again if `j` is already `M`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `j` is now `M + 1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `dp`) remain unchanged. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp[k + 1][2]` is equal to `dp[k + 1][1]`, `j` is `M + 1`**
