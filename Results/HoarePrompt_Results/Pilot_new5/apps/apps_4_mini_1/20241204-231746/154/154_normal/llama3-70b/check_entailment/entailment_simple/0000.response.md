To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly computes the maximum points Polycarp can earn given the constraints provided.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Input Details**:
   - `n`: Number of tasks
   - `k`: Number of subtasks per task
   - `M`: Total minutes available
   - `t`: A list of integers where each `t[j]` represents the time needed to complete the j-th subtask.

2. **Points Calculation**:
   - Each completed subtask gives 1 point.
   - Completing all subtasks of a task gives an extra point â€” total points for a complete task = `k + 1`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Polycarp can complete subtasks in any order.
   - The total time for solving subtasks must not exceed `M`.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The program creates a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
     - `i` indicates the first `i` subtasks considered.
     - `j` indicates the total time used.
     - `dp[i][j]` counts the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within `j` minutes using the first `i` subtasks.
   
2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each subtask.
   - The inner loop iterates over each possible time from `1` to `M`.
   - The code updates `dp[i][j]` by taking the maximum of:
     - Not taking the subtask (inheriting from `dp[i][j-1]`).
     - Taking the subtask if time allows (`dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`).

3. **Final Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points as the sum of the maximum points possible for each subtask configuration and adds 1 point for each fully completed task where `dp[i][M] == i`.

### Correctness Check:

After reviewing the program's logic:
- The DP table fills as expected for maximum subtasks solvable within the given time.
- The calculation for additional points for fully completed tasks is also correctly handled.

However, upon examining the final points calculation, there is a potential issue:
- The program computes points based on how many complete tasks can be solved using the condition `dp[i][M] == i`, which does not correctly reflect the count of fully completed tasks (tasks with all `k` subtasks solved).

### Conclusion:
Given that the points awarded for fully completed tasks may not be calculated correctly (especially when the time `M` is not sufficient to complete all `k` subtasks of any task), the method of summing points based on the DP array can lead to undercounting the total points Polycarp can earn.

Thus, the program's output cannot be guaranteed to always match the problem description under all conditions.

Correctness: **False**
