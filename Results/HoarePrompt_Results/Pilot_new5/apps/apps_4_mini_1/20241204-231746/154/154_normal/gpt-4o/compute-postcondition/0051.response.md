Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The `current_index` remains less than `len(t) - 1`.***
