The value of `remaining_time` is calculated as `M - time_used`. The variable `M` is a non-negative integer with values in the range 0 to 2·10^9, and `time_used` is 0. Therefore, `remaining_time` will be equal to `M - 0`, which simplifies to just `M`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer `t[j]` is such that 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, and `remaining_time` is equal to `M`.**
