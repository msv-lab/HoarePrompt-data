The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State remains as it was, except for the increment of `complete_tasks` and the update to `time_used`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`, `time_used` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
