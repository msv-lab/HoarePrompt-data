To analyze the given code snippet, we start with the initial state of the variables. We observe that the key components that will be affected by the code include `max_points`, `points`, and `subtasks_solved`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45.
   - `subtasks_solved` is updated to `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.
   - `remaining_time` remains unchanged.
   - `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`.
   - `time_used` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task`.
   - `points` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The line `max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)` updates the variable `max_points`. The new value of `max_points` will be the greater of its current value or the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`.

3. **Variables Updated**:
   - `subtasks_solved` is modified based on the formula `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.
   - `complete_tasks` is incremented by 1.
   - `points` is calculated as `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`.
   - `max_points` is updated based on its comparison with `points + subtasks_solved`.

Given that we do not have specific numerical values for the variables, we cannot compute explicit numerical outputs. Therefore, we can only describe the relationships and updates as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `subtasks_solved` is updated to `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`; `remaining_time` remains unchanged; `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`; `time_used` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task`; `points` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`; `max_points` is updated to `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`.**
