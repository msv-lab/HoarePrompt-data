According to the code, for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variable `t`, which is expected to be iterable. The loop will iterate over the elements in `t`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, `t` must contain at least one element. The states that need to be adjusted should take into account the current values given, specifically focusing on `t` and its contents.

Since `n`, `k`, `points`, `remaining_time`, and `subtasks_solved` do not directly influence the ability to iterate over `t`, the critical adjustment here involves ensuring that `t` is not empty.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `t` must be a non-empty iterable**
