According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `i`, which iterates from 1 to `k`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Given that `i` is currently iterating, we can deduce that after the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be equal to `k + 1` (the condition for the loop to terminate). 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `n` remains an integer.
- `k` remains greater than 0.
- `M` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` remains a sorted list of `k` integers.
- `dp` continues to represent the updated states, where `dp[k + 1][j]` remains defined by the previously stated conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `i` is `k + 1`**
