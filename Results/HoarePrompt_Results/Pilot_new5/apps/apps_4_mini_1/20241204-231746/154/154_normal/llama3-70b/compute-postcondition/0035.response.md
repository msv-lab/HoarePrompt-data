According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. Since `M` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 1 in the first iteration. The variable `i` is currently set to `k + 1`, which does not affect the execution of the loop in this case. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute correctly, `M` must be at least 1, and `j` will start at 1 on the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 1**
