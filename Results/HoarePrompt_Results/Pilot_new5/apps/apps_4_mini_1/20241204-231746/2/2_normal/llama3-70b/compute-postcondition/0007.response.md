The value of `max_num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `max_num` will be updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 1, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
