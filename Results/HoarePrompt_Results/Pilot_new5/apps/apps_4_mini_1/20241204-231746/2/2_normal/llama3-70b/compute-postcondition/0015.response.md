The code assigns `digit_sum` the value of the sum of the digits of `i`. Since `i` is 3, the sum of the digits of 3 is 3 itself. Therefore, `digit_sum` is updated to 3. The other variables (`x`, `max_sum`, `max_num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `max_sum` remains unchanged, `max_num` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3**
