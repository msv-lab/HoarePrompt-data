The variable `max_num` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0; `max_num` is 0.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0; `max_num` is 0.**
