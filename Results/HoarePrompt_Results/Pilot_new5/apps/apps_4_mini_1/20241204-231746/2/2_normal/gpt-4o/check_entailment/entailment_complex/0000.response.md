Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads a positive integer `x`, which is within the specified range of 1 to \(10^{18}\).

2. **Finding Candidates**:
   - The program checks if the first digit of `x` is not '1'. If this condition is true, it constructs a candidate number by reducing the first digit of `x` by 1 and appending '9's for the remaining digits. This ensures that the candidate is the largest number that is less than `x` and has a potentially high sum of digits.
   - If the first digit is '1', it simply considers the largest number with the same length as `x` made entirely of '9's.

3. **Sum of Digits**: The function `func_1` computes the sum of the digits of any given integer. This is used to compare the sum of digits of `x` with the sum of digits of the candidate number.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the candidate if it has a greater sum of digits than `x`. If not, it outputs `x`. This ensures that Anton gets the largest integer less than or equal to `x` with the maximum possible sum of its digits.

5. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic checks for the condition that if there are several integers with the maximum sum of digits, it selects the largest one (which is handled by choosing '9's appropriately).

The program essentially explores the boundary conditions and ensures that the integer returned is always less than or equal to `x` while maximizing the sum of digits, thereby adhering to the requirements of the problem description without failing any potential edge cases.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
