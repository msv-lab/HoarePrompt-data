The variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `x` remains unchanged, as this code snippet does not affect it. Therefore, `max_sum` is now set to 0, while `x` still holds its value as an input integer within the range of 1 to 10^18.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0**
