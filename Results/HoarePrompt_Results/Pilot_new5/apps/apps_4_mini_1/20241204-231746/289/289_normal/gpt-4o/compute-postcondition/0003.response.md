The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Since no specific return values or cases were provided in the output, we cannot determine any return conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a positive integer `n` within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.**
