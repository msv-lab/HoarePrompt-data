The code prints the value of `max_games`, which is calculated based on the binary representation of `n`. The variable `max_games` is defined as `n.bit_length() - 1`, where `n` is a positive integer in the range from 2 to \(10^{18}\). The bit length of `n` indicates the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, and subtracting 1 gives the maximum number of complete games that can be played. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `max_games` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, which is a non-negative integer.**
