The value of `max_games` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, which will be at least 2 for positive integers \( n \) in the range specified. Therefore, `max_games` will be a non-negative integer equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `max_games` is a non-negative integer equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
