Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (with constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), calculates the bit length of `n` (which indicates the number of bits required to represent the integer in binary), and prints this value as `max_games`. This function does not return a value but outputs the result directly. **
