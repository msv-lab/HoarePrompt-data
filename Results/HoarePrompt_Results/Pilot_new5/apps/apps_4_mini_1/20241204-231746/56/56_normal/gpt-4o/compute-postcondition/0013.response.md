Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 58. If the bit at position 58 of `n` is set, `bits` now includes the value 58. If the bit at position 58 of `n` is not set, the state of `bits` remains unchanged.***
