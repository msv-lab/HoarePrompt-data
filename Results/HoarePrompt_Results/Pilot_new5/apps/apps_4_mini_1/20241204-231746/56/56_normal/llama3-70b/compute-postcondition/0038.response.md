The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as defined in the provided signature. However, it operates under certain constraints indicating that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^5\). 

Since the function signature does not include parameters, we can conclude that the function may utilize these values in a different manner, perhaps through global variables or predefined constants.

The output of the function based on the constraints is not provided, so we cannot detail any return values or cases related to the function's behavior.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the functionality of the function is not fully specified.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates with constraints on n and k, which are positive integers within defined ranges. Return behavior is not specified.**
