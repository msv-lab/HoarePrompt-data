The statement `bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends a new element to the `bits` list, which will be `smallest - 1`. The previous state indicated that `smallest` was the last element of `bits` before it was popped, meaning that `smallest` was one of the elements in `bits` before the pop operation. After the execution, `bits` will contain one more element than it had after the pop operation.

Since `len(bits)` is less than `k`, adding `smallest - 1` will still keep the length of `bits` within the allowed limit.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` ≤ `n`, `len(bits)` is less than `k`, `smallest` is the last element that was in `bits` before it was popped, `bits` has one more element equal to `smallest - 1`**.
