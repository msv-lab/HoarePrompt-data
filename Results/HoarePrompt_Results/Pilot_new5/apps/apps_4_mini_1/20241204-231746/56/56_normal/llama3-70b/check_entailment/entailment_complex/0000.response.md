Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Basic Feasibility Check**: The program checks if `n < k` and outputs 'No' if true. This is not sufficient as a check for feasibility. Just because `n` is greater than or equal to `k` does not guarantee that it is possible to express `n` as a sum of `k` powers of 2. For example, if `n=3` and `k=4`, the program would incorrectly output 'Yes', while it is impossible to represent 3 as a sum of four powers of 2.

2. **Insufficient Power Collection Logic**: The program collects powers of 2 based on the bit length of `n`, but it does not ensure that the collected powers can be combined to equal `n` when exactly `k` elements are required. The logic does not account for distributing the powers in such a way that meets the requirement of having exactly `k` integers whose sum equals `n`.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: Although the program sorts the output in reverse order to try and achieve the lexicographically largest sequence, it does not ensure that this sequence meets the condition of minimizing the largest integer while also maintaining the required sum of `n`. The program may end up prioritizing larger powers without ensuring that the smaller powers, which might be necessary to fill the count to `k`, are also considered and combined properly.

4. **Negative Powers of Two**: The problem description allows for negative powers of two (e.g., -1 in the provided example for `n=1, k=2`). The current implementation does not handle negative powers of two effectively. It only collects positive powers of two and does not use negative powers even when required.

Due to these reasons, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements accurately in all scenarios, leading to incorrect outputs for various possible inputs.
