The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\). 

The function has three possible return cases:
- Case 1: If the current value of `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- Case 2: The function returns 'No'.
- Case 3: The function returns 'Yes' followed by the elements of the list 'bits' joined by spaces, where 'bits' contains `k` elements sorted in descending order and is derived from the original bits.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, and determine whether to return 'No' based on the relationship between `k` and `n`, or return 'Yes' along with a sorted list of elements if certain conditions are met. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer) and `k` (a positive integer), returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n`, returns 'No' under another condition, or returns 'Yes' followed by sorted elements from the list 'bits' if certain conditions are satisfied.**
