The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and the parameter `b` is a list of integers of length `n` consisting solely of 0s and 1s. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the conditions defined within its logic. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a list p representing a valid permutation of length n, and a list b consisting of 0s and 1s, and it returns a result based on the conditions defined in the function.**
