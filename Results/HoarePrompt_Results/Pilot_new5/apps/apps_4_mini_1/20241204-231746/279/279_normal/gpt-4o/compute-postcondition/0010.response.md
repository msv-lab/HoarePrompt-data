`x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list, and `x` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 0**.
