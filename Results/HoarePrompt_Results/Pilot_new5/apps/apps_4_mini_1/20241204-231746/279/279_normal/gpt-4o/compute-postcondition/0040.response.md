The variable `x` is assigned the value of `p[x] - 1`. Given that `visited[x]` is True and `p[1]` is greater than or equal to 3, we can conclude that `p[x]` must also be greater than or equal to 3 (since `x` is a valid index in `p` and `p` is presumably indexed starting from 1). Therefore, `x` will be decreased by 1 based on the value of `p[x]`.

The previous states of the variables are as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `p[1]` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `visited[2]` is True.
- `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current `cycle` which is now `[1, p[1] - 1, x]`.
- `visited[x]` is True.

The new value of `x` will be `p[x] - 1`, but since the exact value of `p[x]` is not given, it remains as `p[x] - 1` in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `p[1]` is greater than or equal to 3; `visited[2]` is True; `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current `cycle` which is now `[1, p[1] - 1, p[x] - 1]`; `visited[x]` is True.**
