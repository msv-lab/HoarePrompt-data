According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once because `range(n)` will produce a sequence starting from `0` up to `n-1`. 

Before the loop starts, the variable `i` needs to be adjusted for the first iteration. Since `i` is initialized to `0` at the start of the loop, we can say:

- `i` is now `0` for the first iteration of the loop.
- The lists `p`, `b`, and `visited` are already prepared as required by the loop, and `cycles` is initialized as an empty list, which does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the necessary states to ensure the loop can execute are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of n False values, `cycles` is an empty list**.
