The `cycle` list is updated by appending the value of `x`, which is 2. The previous state of `cycles`, which is an empty list, will now have its contents updated to include this new value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited[2]` is True, `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current cycle which now includes 2, and `x` is 2.**
