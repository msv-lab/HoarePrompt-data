The value of `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`. Since `x` is greater than 0, we can look up the value of `p` at index `x` and subtract 1 from it. This means that `x` will take on a new value which is one less than the value in `p` at that index. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list with the first value `True` and the value at index `x` is `True`, other values are `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing 0 and `x`, `x` is equal to `p[x] - 1`**.
