The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. However, the initial value of `ans` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. 

Since the other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged, we keep their initial descriptions intact. The variable `i` is still equal to `n + 1`, which means it is outside the range of `p` since `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `ans` is increased by 1.**
