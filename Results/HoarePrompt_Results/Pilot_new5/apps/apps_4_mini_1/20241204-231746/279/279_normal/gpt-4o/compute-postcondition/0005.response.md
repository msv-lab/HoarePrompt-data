The variable `visited` is initialized as a list of `False` values, where the length of the list is equal to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (equal to `int(data[0])`), the `visited` list will contain `n` elements, all set to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[1:n + 1]`, `b` is a list of integers containing the values from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]` converted to integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values.**
