The variable `ans` is printed, which means its value is displayed as output but not changed by this operation. We are only concerned with the output of `ans`, which is defined as the count of indices `i` where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` plus the count of indices `i` where `b[i]` is equal to 0, across all indices from 0 to `n-1`. Since `ans` is derived from the initial state of `p` and `b`, the values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is equal to the count of indices `i` where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` plus the count of indices `i` where `b[i]` is equal to 0.**
