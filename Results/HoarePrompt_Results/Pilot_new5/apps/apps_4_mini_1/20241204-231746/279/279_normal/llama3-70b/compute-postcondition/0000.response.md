The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input integer. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer in the range of 1 to 200000, the output will maintain this condition, but `n` will now hold the specific input integer value provided. The states of the other variables (`p` and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, both of length n; `n` is an input integer.**
