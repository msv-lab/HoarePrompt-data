According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` relative to `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the current value of `i` must be `n - 1` (the last valid index for the loop to execute). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which means `i` will be `n`, and the loop will not execute again since it would exceed the range.

Thus, the state can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to n**
