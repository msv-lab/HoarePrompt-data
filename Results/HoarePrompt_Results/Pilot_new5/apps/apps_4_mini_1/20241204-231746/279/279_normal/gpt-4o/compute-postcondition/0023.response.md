Output State: **`visited` contains `True` for every index that was visited during the loop iterations, `cycles` contains the `cycle` formed by the indices visited, `cycle` contains all indices that were part of the cycle, `x` is an index that points to an already visited node (indicating the end of the loop). If all `n` indices are visited, then `visited` will have all `n` values as `True`.**
