The variable `cycle` is assigned an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `cycles` is an empty list, and `cycle` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list.**
