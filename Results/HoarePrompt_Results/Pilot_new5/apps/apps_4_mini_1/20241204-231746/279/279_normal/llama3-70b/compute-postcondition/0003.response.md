The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The other variables, `n`, `p`, and `b`, remain unchanged as the code only affects the value of `ans`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of the integers provided as input; `ans` is 0.**
