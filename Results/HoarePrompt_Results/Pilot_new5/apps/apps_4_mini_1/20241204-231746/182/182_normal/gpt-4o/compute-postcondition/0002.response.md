The variable `normalized_angle` is calculated as `x % 360`, which normalizes the angle to be within the range of 0 to 359 degrees. Then, `turns` is assigned the value of `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. This calculation determines how many 90-degree turns are needed to get to the next multiple of 90 degrees from the current angle. The values of `x` and `normalized_angle` are still present in the output state, as they have not changed. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360; `turns` is equal to `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`.**
