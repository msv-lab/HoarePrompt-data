To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise rotations needed to correct an image that has been rotated by a given angle `x`. The input can be positive (indicating clockwise rotation) or negative (indicating counter-clockwise rotation). 

### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)
```

### Output Hints:
The function takes an integer input `x`, normalizes it to a range of 0-359 degrees, and calculates the number of required 90-degree clockwise turns. It prints this number based on the normalized angle.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code normalizes the input angle using `x % 360`, which is correct for converting any angle (positive or negative) into a manageable range.
2. The calculation of turns as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` is intended to determine how many 90-degree clockwise rotations are needed to return to the "true up" position.

### Edge Cases Considered:
1. **Input `x = 60`:**
   - Normalized angle = `60`
   - Required turns = `(360 - 60) // 90 % 4 = 3`
   - This aligns with the example provided, where it outputs `1`. Here, the program's output is incorrect.

2. **Input `x = -60`:**
   - Normalized angle = `300` (since `-60 % 360 = 300`)
   - Required turns = `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 0`
   - This should correctly return `0` but does not reflect the example output of `3`.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints explain that the function calculates the number of 90-degree turns, but they are misleading in the context because the example calculations provided show that the code does not handle the logic of rotating the image based on the counter-clockwise input correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given that the code fails to provide correct outputs for the specified examples and does not handle the counter-clockwise rotations as required by the problem statement, we conclude that the program does not satisfy the correctness requirement.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to output the expected minimum number of 90-degree rotations for various inputs, particularly not handling the rotation logic properly for both positive and negative angles.
