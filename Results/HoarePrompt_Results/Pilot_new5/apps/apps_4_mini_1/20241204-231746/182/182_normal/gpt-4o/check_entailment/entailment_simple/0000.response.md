The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to correct an image taken from a rotating camera, as described in the problem. Let's break down the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Normalization of the Angle**: 
   - The line `normalized_angle = x % 360` ensures that the angle is within the range of 0 to 359 degrees. This is appropriate for determining how far the image is deviated from the vertical position.

2. **Calculating Turns**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of 90-degree turns required to make the image as close to the vertical as possible with:
     ```python
     turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
     ```
   - However, this logic does not adequately consider the cases where the angle is negative or where the deviation from the vertical might require a combination of clockwise and counter-clockwise corrections. 

3. **Ignoring Counter-Clockwise Rotations**:
   - The program does not account for scenarios where the camera is rotated counter-clockwise (i.e., negative angles). The behavior of the `(360 - normalized_angle)` calculation will not correctly reflect the required 90-degree turns in these cases. 
   - Specifically, when `x` is negative, the adjustment needed to bring the image closer to vertical is not correctly calculated, which means the answer will be incorrect for such inputs.

4. **Missing Edge Cases**:
   - The logic fails to handle how to minimize the deviation based on the specific rotation. For instance, the problem states that if the camera is at -60 degrees, the minimal turns needed are 3, but the function would not yield that value due to the incorrect calculation logic.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to meet the problem description's specifications for all potential cases.

Therefore, the final verdict on the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
