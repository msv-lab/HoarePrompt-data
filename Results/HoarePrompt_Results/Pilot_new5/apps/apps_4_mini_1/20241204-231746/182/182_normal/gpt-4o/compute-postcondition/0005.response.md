Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `x`, representing a camera rotation angle in degrees, and calculates the number of 90-degree turns needed to return the camera to its original orientation. It prints this number of turns, which is based on the normalized angle of `x` modulo 360. The function does not handle any input validation and assumes the input is always provided as an integer. **
