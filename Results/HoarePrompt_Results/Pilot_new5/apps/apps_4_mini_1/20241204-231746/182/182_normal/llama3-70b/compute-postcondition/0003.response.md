The code `print(0)` outputs the value `0` to the console. The value of `x` remains unchanged as the print statement does not affect it. The initial state indicates that `x` is currently `0`, which falls within the range specified.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, after the operation `x` becomes `x % 360` within the range of -359 to 359, and the current value of `x` is 0. The value `0` has been printed.**
