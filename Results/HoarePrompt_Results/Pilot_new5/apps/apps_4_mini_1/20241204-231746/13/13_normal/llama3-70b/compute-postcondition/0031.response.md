According to the code, the loop can execute if both conditions `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'` are satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is 2, `right` must be greater than 1, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'.

1. Since `left` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `right` must be greater than 2 to ensure that `left < right` remains true. 
2. `s[left]` being not equal to 'G' must also hold true for the loop to execute again.

Since `left` is 2, and `s[left]` must not start with 'G', we need to ensure that `s[2]` is not 'G'. The current conditions already imply that `s[left] != 'G'`, so no change is needed there.

To summarize, we need to adjust the state regarding `right`, stating that it must be greater than 2 to ensure the loop can proceed one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` must not start with 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 1, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 2, `right` must be greater than 2**
