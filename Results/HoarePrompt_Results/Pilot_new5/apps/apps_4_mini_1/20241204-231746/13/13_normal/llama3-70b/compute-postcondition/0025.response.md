In the given code, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. The initial value of `max_beauty` is 0, and `curr_beauty` is 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `max_beauty` will be updated to 1, since max(0, 1) = 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 1, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 1**
