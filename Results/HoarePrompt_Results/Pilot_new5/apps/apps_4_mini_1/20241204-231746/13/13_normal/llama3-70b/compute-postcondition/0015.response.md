The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial constraints state that `left` is at least 1, so after this operation, `left` will be at least 2. The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string such that `s[left]` must not be 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is at least 2, `right` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string such that `s[left]` must not be 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is at least 2, `right` must be greater than 0.**
