`left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is 2, so after the operation, `left` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` must not start with 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 1, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 3, `right` must be greater than 2**
