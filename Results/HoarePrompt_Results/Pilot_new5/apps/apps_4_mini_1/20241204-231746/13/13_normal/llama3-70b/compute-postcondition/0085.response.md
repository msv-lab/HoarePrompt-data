The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected. Since `j` is defined as `i + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `j`, the conditions on `n` and `j` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and must be greater than `i + 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
