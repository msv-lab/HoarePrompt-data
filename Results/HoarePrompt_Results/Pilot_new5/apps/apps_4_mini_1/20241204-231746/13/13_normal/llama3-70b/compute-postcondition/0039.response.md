The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `left` is updated to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `n`, `right` is 2, and `curr_beauty` is increased by 1.
