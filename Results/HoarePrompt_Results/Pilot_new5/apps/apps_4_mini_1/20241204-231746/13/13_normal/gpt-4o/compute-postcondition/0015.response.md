Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S', and `segments` is an empty list. If the first character of `trophies` is 'G', `i` is equal to the count of consecutive 'G' characters from the beginning of `trophies`, and `segments` contains the tuple `(0, i - 1)`. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1, and the first character of `trophies` is 'S'.***
