Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than the final value of `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, and `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G's found from index `i + 2` until a non-'G' character is encountered, while `j` is updated accordingly based on the loop execution.***
