Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, and `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is increased by 1 and `left` is updated to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `n`. Otherwise, if `s[left]` is not 'G' or if `left` has reached `right`, indicating that there are no 'G's before that, `right` remains 2 while `curr_beauty` is increased by 1 if `left` is less than `right`. The `golden` list contains indices of all 'G's found in `s` up to the original position of `left`.***
