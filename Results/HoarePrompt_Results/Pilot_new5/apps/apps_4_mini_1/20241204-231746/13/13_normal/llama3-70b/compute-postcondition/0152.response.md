According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Currently, `i` is less than `n - 3`, which means `i + 2` is less than `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, since the loop starts at `j = i + 2`, it can execute again if `j` can be incremented one more time. 

Given that `j` starts at `i + 2`, to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `i + 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` (which is now `i + 3`) is still less than `n`. This means that for the loop to execute again, the condition must be satisfied: 

`i + 3 < n`, which can be written as `i < n - 3`.

So, in summary:
- `j` will be `i + 3` for the next iteration.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, which maintains the requirement that `i` is less than `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 3`, `j` is `i + 3` such that `n` must be greater than `i + 3`.**
