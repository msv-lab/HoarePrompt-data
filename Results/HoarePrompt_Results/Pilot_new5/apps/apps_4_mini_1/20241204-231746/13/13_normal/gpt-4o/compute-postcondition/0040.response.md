The value of `i` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `i` is not provided, so it remains unknown. The other variables `n`, `trophies`, and `segments` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state should reflect the increment of `i` without specifying its exact value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, and `i` is increased by 1.**
