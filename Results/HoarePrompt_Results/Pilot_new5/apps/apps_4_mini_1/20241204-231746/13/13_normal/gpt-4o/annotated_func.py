#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\)) and a string `trophies` of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'. It identifies segments of consecutive 'G' characters and calculates the maximum length of these segments. If no 'G' characters are found, it returns 0. If there is only one segment of 'G' characters, it returns its length. If there are multiple segments, it checks for gaps of exactly one 'S' between segments and may consider combining them, ultimately returning the minimum of `max_length + 1` and `n`.
