The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and must be greater than `i + 3`, and `j` is `i + 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
