The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The conditions on `n`, `trophies[start]`, and `start` are unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies[start]` must be 'G', `start` must be less than `n`, and `i` is increased by 1.**
