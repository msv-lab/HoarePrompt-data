Output State: **`left` is equal to the index of the first 'G' in `s`, or `left` has reached `right` if there are no 'G's before that; `s[left]` is 'G' or `left` is equal to `right`, implying that all characters before `right` were not 'G'; `right` remains 2; `golden` contains indices of all 'G's found in `s` up to the original position of `left`; the current value of `left` is less than `right`; `curr_beauty` is increased by 1.**
