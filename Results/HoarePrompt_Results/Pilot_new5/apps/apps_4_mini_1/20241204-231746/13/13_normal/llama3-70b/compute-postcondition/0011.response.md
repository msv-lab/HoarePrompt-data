The variable `curr_beauty` is assigned the value `0`, which means that it is now explicitly set to `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, including `max_beauty`, which is either `curr_beauty` if greater than 0 or 0 (but since `curr_beauty` is now 0, `max_beauty` will also remain 0). The other variables such as `n`, `s`, `golden`, `left`, and `right` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the character at index `right` in `s` is not 'G'.**
