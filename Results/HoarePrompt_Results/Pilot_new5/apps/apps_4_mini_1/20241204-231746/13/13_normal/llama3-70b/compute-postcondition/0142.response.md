To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop structure and the conditions that affect its execution.

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `i + 2` to `n`. 
2. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `i + 2` must be less than `n`.

Given that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\), we can infer:
- The minimum value for `i + 2` must be less than `n`. If `n` equals 2, then `i` must be less than or equal to 0, which is not within the permissible range based on the context provided.
- For practical execution, \(i\) must satisfy the condition \(i < n - 2\).

3. The other variables `beauty`, `curr_beauty`, and `max_beauty` do not directly influence the execution of the for loop in terms of iteration. However, they might be relevant depending on the loop body, which is omitted here.

Based on this analysis, the following adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute:
- `i` must be such that \(i < n - 2\) to ensure that \(i + 2\) is less than \(n\).
  
Thus, the required states are as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be less than `n - 2`, `beauty` is equal to `1 + k` where `k` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from index `i - 1`, `j` is `i - k - 1`, `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, and `max_beauty` remains unchanged.**
