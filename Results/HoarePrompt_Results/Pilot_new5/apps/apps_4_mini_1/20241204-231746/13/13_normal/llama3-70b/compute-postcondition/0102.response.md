Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000. If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented by 1, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than `right`, and `right` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `beauty` is set to 1 or 2 depending on `s[j]`, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than `right`, `right` remains equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
