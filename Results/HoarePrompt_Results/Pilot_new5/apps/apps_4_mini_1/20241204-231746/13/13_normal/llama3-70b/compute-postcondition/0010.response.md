The line of code assigns the maximum value between `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` to `max_beauty`. Since `max_beauty` is initially 0, the only way it can be updated is if `curr_beauty` is greater than 0. However, the value of `curr_beauty` is not given, so we will need to consider both scenarios: if `curr_beauty` is greater than 0, then `max_beauty` will be updated to that value; if `curr_beauty` is 0 or negative, `max_beauty` remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is either `curr_beauty` if greater than 0 or 0, `curr_beauty` is unchanged, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the character at index `right` in `s` is not 'G'.**
