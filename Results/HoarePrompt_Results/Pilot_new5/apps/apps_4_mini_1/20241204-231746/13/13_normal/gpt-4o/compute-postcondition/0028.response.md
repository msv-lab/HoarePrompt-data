Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S', and `segments` is an empty list. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `segments` includes the segment `(start, i - 1)` where `start` is the first index of 'G' in `trophies`. If `trophies[i]` is not 'G', then `i` is incremented by 1.***
