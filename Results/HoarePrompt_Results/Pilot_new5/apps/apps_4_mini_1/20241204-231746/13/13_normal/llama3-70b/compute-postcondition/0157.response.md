The code updates the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `beauty`. The value of `beauty` is calculated as `1 + k + m`, where `m` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from index `i + 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `beauty` is equal to `1 + k + m`, where `m` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from index `i + 2`, `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, `max_beauty` remains unchanged, `max_beauty_one_swap` is now the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.**
