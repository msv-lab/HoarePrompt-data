Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than the final value of `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', and `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G's found from index `i` until a non-'G' character is encountered. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not 'G', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
