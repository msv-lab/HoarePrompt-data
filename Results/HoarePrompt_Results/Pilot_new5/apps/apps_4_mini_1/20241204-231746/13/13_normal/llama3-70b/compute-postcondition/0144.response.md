The `beauty` variable is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` was `1 + k`, where `k` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from index `i - 1`. After the operation, the new value of `beauty` will be `2 + k`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `beauty` is equal to `2 + k`, `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, `max_beauty` remains unchanged, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G'.**
