Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's starting from index `i` down to the first non-'G', `curr_beauty` is equal to `beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, and `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`.***
