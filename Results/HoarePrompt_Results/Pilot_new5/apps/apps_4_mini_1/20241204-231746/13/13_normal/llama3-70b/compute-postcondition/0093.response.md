To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we must analyze the provided conditions and the for loop's structure.

1. The loop is structured as `for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1)`, which means it will iterate from `i - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). 
2. For the loop to execute, `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`. This implies that `i` must be at least `1`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, and since `n` is at least `2`, this condition is satisfied.
3. The loop will execute if `j` starts from `i - 1` (which is `n - 3`) down to `0`.

Now, let's summarize the relevant states:
- `n` is already constrained to values between `2` and `100000`, which ensures that `i` will always be at least `0` since `i = n - 2`.
- The loop starts at `j = i - 1`, which is `n - 3`, so we need to ensure that `i - 1 >= 0` holds true.
- In this scenario, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty`, and other state variables do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself but can be considered in the context of what happens during the loop.

Considering the analysis, the necessary adjustments are minimal since the provided state already satisfies the conditions required for the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `i - 1`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `beauty` is 1.**
