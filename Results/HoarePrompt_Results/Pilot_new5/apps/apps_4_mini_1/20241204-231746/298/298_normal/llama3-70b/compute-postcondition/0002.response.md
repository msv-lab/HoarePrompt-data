The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers with constraints that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns two values: `x` and `y`, which are the results of another function called `func_2` with inputs `a` and `b`. Additionally, it calculates and returns the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, process them through `func_2` to obtain `x` and `y`, and then return the values of `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, returns the results of func_2(a, b), and the value of the expression x * a + y * b.**
