To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description thoroughly.

### Problem Description:
Vasya wants to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
- \(0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n\)
- \(0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m\)
- The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The input consists of three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). The checks for valid inputs are implicitly done by the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 10^9\) and \(2 \le k \le 10^9\).

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - The program checks if \(n \times m \% k\) is not equal to zero. If it is not zero, it prints "NO", indicating that no configuration can yield the desired area, which is correct since the area must be an integer.

3. **Finding Points**:
   - The program calls `func_3(n, m)`, which uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find coefficients \(x\) and \(y\). The function also returns \(g = x \cdot n + y \cdot m\).
   - It checks whether \(|n1 \cdot m| \ge g\), where \(n1\) is one of the coefficients obtained from `func_3`.

4. **Output Points**: 
   - If the condition holds, it prints the points:
     - (0, 0) 
     - (0, \(n1 \cdot m // g\))
     - (\(m1 \cdot m // g\), 0)
   - If the condition does not hold, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
- The code relies heavily on the outputs of `func_3` and the extended Euclidean algorithm. If the outputs do not align with the requirements of the problem, the points generated might not yield the correct area.
- The condition \(n1 \cdot m \ge g\) is critical. If this fails, it presumes that the triangle cannot be formed, but there could be configurations that satisfy the area condition despite this inequality.
- For the example input \(4, 4, 7\), the desired area is \(\frac{16}{7}\), which is not an integer, hence correctly returns "NO". However, if any \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) values allow for a non-integer area, the program may fail to find valid coordinates.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the code does not adequately handle all edge cases for forming the triangle correctly. The checks and computations might lead to scenarios where valid triangle formations are overlooked due to strict conditions based on the outputs of the extended Euclidean algorithm. 

Hence, I found a potential case where the program would not return the correct output.

Correctness: **False**.
