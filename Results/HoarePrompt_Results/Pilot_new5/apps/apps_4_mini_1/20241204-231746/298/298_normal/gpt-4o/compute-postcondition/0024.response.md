Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9, and `area` is equal to `n * m / k`. If `area` is not an integer, 'NO' is printed. If `area` is an integer and equals 0, 'NO' is printed. If `area` is not equal to 0, then if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output printed is '0 1'. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output printed is '0 {m // 2}'. If neither condition is satisfied, the output is also '0 {m // 2}'.***
