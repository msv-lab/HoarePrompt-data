To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze how well it aligns with the requirements outlined in the problem description regarding finding three integer points that form a triangle with a specific area.

### Requirements from the Problem Description:
1. The three points must be within the bounds defined by `0 ≤ x_1, x_2, x_3 ≤ n` and `0 ≤ y_1, y_2, y_3 ≤ m`.
2. The area of the triangle formed by these points should be equal to `nm/k`.
3. If no such points can be found, the program must print "NO". If they can be found, it must print "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. **Area Calculation**: It calculates the area as `area = n * m / k` and checks if this area is an integer. If not, it prints "NO". This is correct because the area must be an integer.
3. **Area Check**: If the area is `0`, the program prints "NO". This is also correct since a triangle cannot have an area of `0`.
4. **Triangle Construction**: 
   - The program attempts to find coordinates for the points based on the calculated area:
     - If `2 * area <= n`, it constructs points based on this condition.
     - If `2 * area <= m`, it constructs points based on this condition.
     - If neither condition is satisfied, it uses `n` and `m // 2` to print points.
   - However, the conditions under which points are printed may not always satisfy the triangle area requirement correctly, particularly in generating valid integer points that adhere to the constraints.

### Potential Issues:
- The construction of points does not guarantee that the area of the triangle will always equal `nm/k`. For example, while the program checks the conditions for `2 * area`, it does not adequately ensure that the points chosen actually provide the exact area required.
- The program may also not explore all potential configurations of points to ensure that the area condition is met. It has hardcoded conditions that may not cover all edge cases effectively.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly implement the logic necessary to ensure that the area of the triangle formed by the points is guaranteed to equal `nm/k`. It could produce incorrect outputs in specific cases where the chosen integer points do not actually meet the area requirements.

Based on these observations, we conclude that the program does not always meet the problem description's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
