To determine the correctness of the annotated program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description
The problem states that given three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), we need to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
- \( 0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n \)
- \( 0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m \)
- The area of the triangle formed by these points should equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

### Annotated Program Analysis
1. **Checking Area Validity**: The program first checks if \( n \times m \) is divisible by \( k \). If not, it prints "NO" since a triangle cannot have a fractional area.
   
2. **Calculating GCD**: The program uses function `func_3` which internally calls `func_2` (which computes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm) to obtain coefficients \( x \) and \( y \) such that:
   - \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \)
   The output from `func_3` includes \( g = x \times n + y \times m \), where \( g \) is the linear combination of \( n \) and \( m \).

3. **Constructing Points**: The program checks if \( abs(n1 \times m) \geq g \) and if true, it constructs three points:
   - Point A: \( (0, 0) \)
   - Point B: \( (0, \frac{n1 \times m}{g}) \)
   - Point C: \( (\frac{m1 \times m}{g}, 0) \)
   
   However, the variables \( n1 \) and \( m1 \) are not clearly initialized in the provided context, which may lead to confusion. Presumably, they should relate to \( n \) and \( m \) appropriately.

4. **Area Calculation**: The area for the triangle formed by the points is calculated using the determinant method which translates to half the absolute value of a specific linear combination of the coordinates. The area must match \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

### Correctness Evaluation
The approach seems intended to find valid points, but there are multiple points of concern:
- The program does not verify if the chosen points \( B \) and \( C \) are within the bounds specified \( (0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n) \) and \( (0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m) \). If \( \frac{n1 \times m}{g} \) or \( \frac{m1 \times m}{g} \) exceed \( n \) or \( m \), respectively, this would yield incorrect output.
- The program lacks explicit handling or validation for cases where \( g \) might be negative or zero, which can invalidate the area calculation.

### Conclusion
Due to the inadequacy in ensuring the constructed points fall within the specified bounds and the potential misinterpretation of \( n1 \) and \( m1 \), the program does not consistently fulfill the problem requirements across all valid input scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
