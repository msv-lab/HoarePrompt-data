To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find three integer points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) such that:
     - 0 ≤ x1, x2, x3 ≤ n
     - 0 ≤ y1, y2, y3 ≤ m
     - The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to nm/k.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by checking if `n * m % k` is non-zero. If it is, it prints "NO" and exits. This is correct because if the area `nm/k` is not an integer, we cannot form a triangle with that area.
   - Next, it calls `func_3(n, m)`, which returns a tuple containing values that seem to be related to the coefficients of a linear combination of `n` and `m`.
   - The program then checks if `abs(n1 * m) >= g`. If this condition holds, it prints "YES" and provides the coordinates (0, 0), (0, n1 * m // g), and (m1 * m // g, 0). Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` appear to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is unrelated to checking if the triangle can be formed with the specified area.

3. **Identifying Potential Cases**:
   - The program does not seem to consider the possibility that the generated points might not actually form a valid triangle. Specifically, the area condition needs to be verified explicitly with the chosen points.
   - For instance, if we take `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 3`, we get `nm/k = 4`. The points generated could end up being collinear, violating the triangle area requirement.
   - Specifically, if `n1` and `m1` yield points that are collinear, the area will be zero, which clearly does not satisfy the area condition. 
   - An example case would be `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 2` where the expected area should be 6. The points derived by the program might not give the correct triangle, hence failing to satisfy the area condition.

After analyzing the logic and identifying edge cases where the program does not produce valid triangles with the required area, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to ensure that the output points actually form a triangle with the desired area.
