The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. The value of `b` is an input integer, which satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. Therefore, after the operation, `b` can take values from 2 to 20, depending on the initial value of `b`. The values of `a` and `years` are unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`a` is either 3, 6, or 9; `b` is an integer from the input multiplied by 2 (2 ≤ b ≤ 20); `years` is 0.**
