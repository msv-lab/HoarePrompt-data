`a` and `b` are assigned values based on user input, where the input consists of two integers. The values of `a` and `b` must adhere to the constraints of the initial state: 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b` as obtained from the input.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, with 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10.**
