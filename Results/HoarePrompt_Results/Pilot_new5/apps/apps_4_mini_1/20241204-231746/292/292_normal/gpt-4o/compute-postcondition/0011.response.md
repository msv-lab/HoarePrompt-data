`a` is multiplied by 3. The value of `a` can either be 9 or 18. If `a` is 9, then `a` will become 27. If `a` is 18, then `a` will become 54. The values of `b` and `years` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must be either 27 or 54; `b` is greater than or equal to 18; `years` is 2.

Output State: **`a` must be either 27 or 54; `b` is greater than or equal to 18; `years` is 2.**
