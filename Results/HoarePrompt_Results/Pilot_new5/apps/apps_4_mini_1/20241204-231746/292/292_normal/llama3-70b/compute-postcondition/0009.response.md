The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `years` is 1, so after the execution, `years` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `1 ≤ a ≤ 3`, `a` is either 9, 18, or 27; `b` is at least 36, 72, or 108; `years` is now 2.

Output State: **`1 ≤ a ≤ 3`, `a` is either 9, 18, or 27; `b` is at least 36, 72, or 108; `years` is 2**
