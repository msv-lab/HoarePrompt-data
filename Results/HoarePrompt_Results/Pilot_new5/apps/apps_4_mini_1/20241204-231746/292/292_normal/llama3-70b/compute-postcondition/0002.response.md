According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. The loop will execute as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Right before the loop, we have the condition `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, which implies that `a` can take values from 1 to 10 and `b` is at least equal to `a` and can also be up to 10. Since `years` does not impact the loop's condition, we focus solely on `a` and `b`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Given that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, this is already satisfied, and no adjustment is necessary for `a` or `b`. 

Thus, the states do not need any modifications to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, `years` is 0**
