The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly as it is defined without parameters. According to the provided constraints, both `a` and `b` must be integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). Limak's weight is represented by `a` and Bob's weight by `b`, with the condition that Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight.

Since the function's output is not specified in the description you provided, I can't detail the exact return values. However, the function would typically involve logic based on the relationships or comparisons between `a` and `b` given the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates under the constraints where a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, representing the weights of Limak and Bob respectively, with Limak's weight being less than or equal to Bob's weight.**
