The code `print(years)` outputs the value of `years`, but it does not change any variables. The initial state indicates that `a` is greater than `b` and `years` is defined as the number of iterations it took for `a` to exceed `b`. Since no values have changed, the output state retains the existing conditions.

Output State: **`a` is greater than `b`, `years` is the number of iterations it took for `a` to exceed `b`, and the value of `years` has been printed.**
