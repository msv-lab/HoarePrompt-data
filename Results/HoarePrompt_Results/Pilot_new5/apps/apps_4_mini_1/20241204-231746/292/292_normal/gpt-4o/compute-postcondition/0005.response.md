The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `years` was 0, so after the execution, `years` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`a` and `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is either 3, 6, or 9; `b` is an integer from the input multiplied by 2 (2 ≤ b ≤ 20); `years` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is either 3, 6, or 9; `b` is an integer from the input multiplied by 2 (2 ≤ b ≤ 20); `years` is 1.**
