To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code.

The problem states that Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The fruits must be used in the ratio of 1:2:4 to make the compote. Specifically, for each lemon, there must be exactly 2 apples and 4 pears. The goal is to calculate the maximum total number of fruits that can be used according to this ratio.

The program reads the number of each type of fruit and calculates how many complete sets of lemons, apples, and pears can be used based on the given ratios. It does this by finding the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`), which is limited by the availability of apples (half as many) and pears (four times as many). It then calculates the total number of fruits used and prints that value.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Minimum Values**: What happens when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all at their minimum (1)? The program should correctly conclude that no compote can be made.
2. **Excess of One Fruit Type**: Consider a case where `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`. The program should return 0 because there aren't enough pears to make a single complete set.
3. **Sufficient Fruits**: A case where `a = 4`, `b = 8`, and `c = 16` should return 28 (4 lemons, 8 apples, 16 pears).
4. **Not Enough Apples**: With `a = 3`, `b = 5`, and `c = 12`, the program should return 0, as there aren't enough apples for 3 lemons.

### Checking the Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)
```

The logic seems to be implemented correctly as the program uses:
- `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` to ensure the calculated number of lemons does not exceed the available fruits while adhering to the 1:2:4 ratio.
- The calculation for the total fruits is correct as well: `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`.

After considering potential edge cases and verifying the calculations, I find that the program works correctly for all specified inputs and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
