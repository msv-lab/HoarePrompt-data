To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers a, b, and c representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Fruits for Compote**:
   - The program calculates `min_lemon` which represents the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote. This is determined by the formula:
     ```python
     min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
     ```
     - Here, `a` is the number of lemons available.
     - `b // 2` calculates how many lemons can be paired with apples (since 1 lemon requires 2 apples).
     - `c // 4` calculates how many lemons can be paired with pears (since 1 lemon requires 4 pears).
   - The `min` function correctly captures the limiting factor, ensuring that the number of lemons used does not exceed the number of available lemons, nor the quantities required by the apples and pears.
   
3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates and prints the total number of fruits used in the compote:
     ```python
     print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
     ```
     - The expression correctly sums up:
       - `min_lemon` (lemons)
       - `min_lemon * 2` (apples)
       - `min_lemon * 4` (pears)
     - This results in the total number of fruits used in the compote, which is consistent with the problem's requirement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program will return 0 when `min_lemon` is 0, which occurs when there are insufficient apples or pears to match the number of lemons. This aligns with the problem description's provision for possible scenarios where no fruits can be used.

Given this analysis, the program adheres to the logic and requirements laid out in the problem description and correctly computes the maximum number of fruits that can be used for the compote in all specified scenarios.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be affirmed.

Correctness: **True**
