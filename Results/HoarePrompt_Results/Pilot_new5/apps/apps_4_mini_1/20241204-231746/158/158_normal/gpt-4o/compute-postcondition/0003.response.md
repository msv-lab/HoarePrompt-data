The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `c` is an integer, `max_lemons` will hold the smallest of these three values. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `b` is an input positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `c` is an input integer; `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`**.
