The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers that must satisfy the constraints: 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000. After executing the function body, the return value is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot ascertain the specific output of the function based on the given constraints alone.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are integers constrained by 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific return value of the function is not provided.**
