The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum number of modifications required to transform an equilateral triangle with side length \( x \) into one with side length \( y \). The specific calculation performed by the program is as follows:

```python
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

This formula can be interpreted as calculating the ceiling of half the difference between \( x \) and \( y \). However, the problem description clearly states that in one second, Memory can modify the length of a single side of the triangle while ensuring the triangle remains a non-degenerate triangle.

To verify if the program is correct, let's analyze the required operations:

1. To transform an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) to \( y \), Memory can change one side at a time.
2. The final triangle must remain a valid triangle, meaning that no side can be longer than the sum of the other two sides. In the case of an equilateral triangle, this condition simplifies to ensuring that each side remains positive in length.

Given the constraints \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \), the target triangle with side length \( y \) can be achieved through the following process:

- Start with \( (x, x, x) \).
- Gradually decrease the length of the sides until all sides are equal to \( y \).

The correct approach to calculate the number of operations is simply the difference \( x - y \), as each operation can reduce the side length by 1.

### Example Analysis:

For the inputs:

- \( x = 6, y = 3 \): The operations would be \( (6, 6, 6) \rightarrow (6, 6, 3) \rightarrow (6, 4, 3) \rightarrow (3, 4, 3) \rightarrow (3, 3, 3) \). This requires 4 operations, which matches \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) (the program's calculation is incorrect here).
  
- \( x = 8, y = 5 \): The operations would be \( (8, 8, 8) \rightarrow (8, 8, 5) \rightarrow (8, 5, 5) \rightarrow (5, 5, 5) \). The number of operations required is 3, which matches the difference \( 8 - 5 = 3 \).

- \( x = 22, y = 4 \): This would require a total of 18 operations to approach \( (4, 4, 4) \), but the program would not calculate that correctly.

The calculation in the program only correctly computes the ceiling of half the difference, which does not appropriately account for the number of modifications required to achieve the target triangle. 

### Conclusion:

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description accurately, as it fails to compute the actual number of operations needed to transform \( x \) to \( y \) correctly.

Correctness: **False**
