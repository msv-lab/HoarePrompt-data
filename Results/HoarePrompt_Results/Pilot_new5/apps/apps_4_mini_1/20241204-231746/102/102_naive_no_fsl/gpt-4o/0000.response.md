Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible for Vasya to buy a combination of Ber-Cola and Bars bars that exactly sums to the amount of money he has, `n`. 

Here's how the program works:
1. It iterates through all possible non-negative integer values of `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) ranging from `0` to `n // a`.
2. For each `x`, it checks if the remaining money after buying `x` bottles can be evenly divided by the cost of a Bars bar (`b`).
3. If such a combination is found, it calculates `y` (the number of Bars bars) and prints "YES" along with the values of `x` and `y`.
4. If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, it prints "NO".

The program handles the constraints effectively:
- It ensures that both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.
- It checks all feasible combinations of `x` and `y` based on the given `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Additionally, the program can handle the edge cases such as:
- When `n` is exactly equal to either `a` or `b`.
- When `a` and `b` are both larger than `n`, where it correctly identifies that it's impossible to buy any items.

After considering a range of inputs and their combinations, there does not appear to be any case where the program would fail to produce the correct output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
