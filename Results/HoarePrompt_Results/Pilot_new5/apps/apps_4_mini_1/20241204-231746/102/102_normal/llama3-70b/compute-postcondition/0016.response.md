According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the value of `x` and the expression `n // a + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, and since `n // a` is at least 1, we can infer that `n // a` is at least 1 or greater. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` should increment by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be 2, and it can continue as long as `x` does not exceed `n // a`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n // a` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `n // a` is at least 2, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 2, and `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`.**
