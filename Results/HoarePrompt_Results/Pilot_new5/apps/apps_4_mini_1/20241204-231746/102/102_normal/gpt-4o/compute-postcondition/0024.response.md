The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It has three cases based on the function's execution path. In Case_1, the function returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. In Case_2, the function also returns nothing because the return statement is empty. In Case_3, the function returns a value indicating a successful completion without any output, which is typically `None`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to execute without parameters and may return nothing or `None`, depending on the execution path. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and may return nothing or `None` based on the execution path.**
