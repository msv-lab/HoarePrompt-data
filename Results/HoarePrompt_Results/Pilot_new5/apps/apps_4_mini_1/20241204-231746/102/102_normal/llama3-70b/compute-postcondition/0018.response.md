The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string "YES" to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as the print operation does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that none of the variable values have been altered, but the action of printing has occurred.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `n // a` is at least 2; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `x` is 2; `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`; output 'YES' printed.**
