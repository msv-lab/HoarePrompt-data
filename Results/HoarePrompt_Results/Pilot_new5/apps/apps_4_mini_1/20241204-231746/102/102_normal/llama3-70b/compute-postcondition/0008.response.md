The code `exit()` is called, which results in terminating the program immediately. No changes are made to any variables during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the termination status of the program.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, 'YES' is printed, and the values printed are `0` and `y`.**
