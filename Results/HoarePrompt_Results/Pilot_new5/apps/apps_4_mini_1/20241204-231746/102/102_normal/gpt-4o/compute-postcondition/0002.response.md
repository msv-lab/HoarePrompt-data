The variable `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged. The state of `b` will now be the input integer. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer**.
