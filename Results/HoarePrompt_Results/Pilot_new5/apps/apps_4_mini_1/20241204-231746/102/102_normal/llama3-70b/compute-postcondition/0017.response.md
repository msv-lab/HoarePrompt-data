Given the initial state, we have:

- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n // a` is at least 2.
- `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000.
- `x` is 2.
- `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`.

The code snippet is:
```
y = (n - x * a) // b
```

Now we will analyze the impact of the code on the program:

1. `x` is 2, so `x * a` becomes `2 * a`.
2. The new value of `y` is calculated using the formula `(n - 2 * a) // b`.

The variables affected are only `y`, which now will hold a new value based on the calculation. The expression for `y` has been defined in terms of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The other variables `n`, `a`, `x`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `n // a` is at least 2, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 2, `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`**
