Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range of -90 to 90 after all iterations, and `dir` is a string that indicates the final direction inputted during the loop. If any condition leads to an invalid latitude, the program would have printed 'NO' and exited before completing all iterations.**
