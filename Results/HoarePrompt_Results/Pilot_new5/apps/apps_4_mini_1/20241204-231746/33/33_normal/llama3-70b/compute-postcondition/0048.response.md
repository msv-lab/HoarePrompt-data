The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, there are no changes to the values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, or `curr_lat`. The output state retains the existing values of these variables, and we acknowledge that execution continues with the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input string; `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range; execution continues with the next iteration of the loop.**
