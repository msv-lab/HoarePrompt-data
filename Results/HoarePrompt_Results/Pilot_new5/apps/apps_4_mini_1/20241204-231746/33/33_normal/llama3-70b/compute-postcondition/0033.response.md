Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `curr_lat`.***
