Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `90 + (t / 111.195)`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `90 - (t / 111.195)`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then `curr_lat` remains 90. The current value of `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90.***
