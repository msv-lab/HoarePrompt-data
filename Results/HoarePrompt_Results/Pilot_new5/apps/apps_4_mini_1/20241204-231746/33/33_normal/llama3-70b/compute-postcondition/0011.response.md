The `continue` statement does not change any variable values, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and move to the next iteration. Since there are no other changes in variables or states specified before this line, the output state remains largely the same with a note that the iteration continues.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is not equal to 'North', and `dir` is not equal to 'South', and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
