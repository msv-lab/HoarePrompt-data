Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input string; if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)` and remains within the valid latitude range. If `dir` is not 'South', `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range, and execution continues with the next iteration of the loop.***
