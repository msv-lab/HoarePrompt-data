The code snippet executes a print statement without modifying any of the variables as it does not perform any assignments or calculations. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Since the print statement outputs 'NO', it effectively indicates that the condition for modifying `curr_lat` was not met.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input; `curr_lat` is unchanged; 'NO' is printed.**
