The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, which means `n` will be an integer obtained from user input. The previous state indicated that `n` was a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \). Other variables remain unaffected as they are not modified by the code provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 50, and each of the next `n` lines contains an integer `t_i` (1 ≤ `t_i` ≤ 10^6) and a string `dir_i` which is one of "North", "South", "West", "East".**
