The value of `valid` is explicitly set to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction either 'West' or 'East'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction either 'West' or 'East'.**
