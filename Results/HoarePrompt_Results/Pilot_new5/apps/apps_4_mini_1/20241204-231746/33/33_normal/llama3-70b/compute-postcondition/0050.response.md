Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195` and remains within the valid latitude range. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)` and remains within the valid latitude range. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range, and execution continues with the next iteration of the loop.***
