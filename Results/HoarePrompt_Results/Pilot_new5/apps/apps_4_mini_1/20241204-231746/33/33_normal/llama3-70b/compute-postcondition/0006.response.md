The code updates the value of `curr_lat` by adding the result of `t / 111.195` to its previous value. The current value of `curr_lat` is 90. The variable `t` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, `curr_lat` will become `90 + (t / 111.195)`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `curr_lat` is `90 + (t / 111.195)`, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is 'North'**
