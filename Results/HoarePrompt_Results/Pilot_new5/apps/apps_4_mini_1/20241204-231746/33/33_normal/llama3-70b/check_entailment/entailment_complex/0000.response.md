Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Latitude Calculation Error**: The program calculates the latitude based on the distance traveled in kilometers divided by the value `111.195`. This conversion is intended to convert kilometers to degrees of latitude. However, this conversion is not necessary and does not match the problem's requirement of simply checking distances against the poles. The distances should directly affect the value of latitude without conversion.

2. **Handling of Directions 'West' and 'East'**: The program allows movements to 'West' and 'East' to proceed without any validation. The problem description does not specify that these movements should be accounted for in the latitude change, but rather must validate that the journey only allows movements that can ultimately lead back to the North Pole from the South Pole.

3. **Final Position Check**: The final output checks if `curr_lat == 90` to confirm that Limak ends at the North Pole. However, if Limak moves to the South Pole (lat = -90) and then tries to move back North, there needs to be explicit checks to ensure that movements are valid at each pole (i.e., he cannot move 'South' from the North Pole and cannot move 'North' from the South Pole).

4. **Inadequate Boundary Conditions**: The program checks if `curr_lat` goes below -90 or above 90 and exits if it does, which is good. However, it fails to enforce the rule that Limak must end at the North Pole without taking into account other movements that might allow him to return to the North Pole properly after reaching the South Pole.

In summary, the program fails to adhere to the problem's requirements regarding valid movements and does not appropriately track Limak's journey strictly as described. Therefore, it is not a correct implementation of the specified task.
