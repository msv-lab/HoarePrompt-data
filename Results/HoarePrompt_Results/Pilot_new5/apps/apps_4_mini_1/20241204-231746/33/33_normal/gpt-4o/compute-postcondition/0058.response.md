The variable `valid` is assigned the value `False`, but since it already holds the value `False`, there is no change in its state. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `dir`, and `position`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `valid` is False, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', and `position` remains unchanged.**
