The values of `t` and `dir` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which means they will depend on the user input. However, since the exact input is unknown, we cannot determine specific values for `t` and `dir`. 

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `position` is 0, `valid` is True, `t` is an input value, `dir` is an input value**.
