To assess the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the problem specifications.

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - Limak starts at the North Pole (latitude 90).
   - He can only move South when at the North Pole and can only move North when at the South Pole (latitude -90).
   - The journey must end back at the North Pole (latitude 90).
   - Moving East or West should not affect the latitude and is considered invalid.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code initializes the current latitude (`curr_lat`) to 90 (North Pole).
   - It processes each movement, adjusting the latitude based on the direction:
     - Moving North increases latitude.
     - Moving South decreases latitude.
   - The code checks for invalid latitude boundaries, ensuring that `curr_lat` is between -90 and 90.
   - It checks if Limak is at the poles and whether the direction of movement is valid.
   - Finally, it checks if the journey ends at the North Pole (latitude 90).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - A case where Limak moves West or East, which should not be valid according to the problem description. The current implementation does not handle these movements since it skips them with `continue`. However, the requirement states that if at any moment he is not moving according to the conditions, it should result in a "NO". The current implementation does not account for invalid lateral movements.
   - If Limak moves South the first time but doesn't return to the North Pole afterward, it should result in "NO", which appears to be handled correctly.
   - The edge case where Limak moves to latitude -90 and tries to move in any direction other than North is also correctly handled.

4. **Output Hints Analysis:**
   - The output hints state that the function checks bounds and direction validity, which aligns with the code's logic.
   - The hints do not explicitly mention the handling of East/West, which may lead to ambiguity.

Given the problem description and the edge cases identified, the handling of invalid movements (East and West) directly contradicts the requirements. 

The program does not follow the problem description strictly in all potential cases due to the lack of handling for East and West movements. 

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle all movement directions as specified in the problem description. For instance, having a movement like "1000 East" should lead to an immediate "NO", but the current implementation does not enforce this constraint.
