Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input. If `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North', 'NO' is printed, and the program terminates. If `curr_lat` is within the valid latitude range, no action takes place and the program continues.***
