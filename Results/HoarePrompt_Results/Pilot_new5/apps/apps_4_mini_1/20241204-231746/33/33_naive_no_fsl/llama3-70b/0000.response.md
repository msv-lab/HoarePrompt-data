Correctness: **False**

The program contains flaws that prevent it from correctly verifying Limak's journey based on the problem description. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Invalid Direction Check**: The code allows movement in the "West" and "East" directions without any restrictions. The problem description does not specify that these directions are allowed while at the poles, and it states that movement from the North Pole should only be "South" and from the South Pole should only be "North". The program should explicitly handle cases where Limak attempts to move West or East at the poles.

2. **Condition for South Pole**: The check for moving North when at the South Pole is checked only when `curr_lat` equals -90. However, before reaching this condition, if Limak is supposed to move South and the command is not correctly handled, it could lead to invalid paths.

3. **Movement Overshoot**: The program only checks for overstepping latitude bounds but does not account for the fact that Limak may not be allowed to move East or West if he is at either pole. It should assert that attempts to move in invalid directions while at the poles are strictly disallowed.

4. **Final Position Check**: The final position check is executed correctly, but it relies on maintaining valid states throughout the journey, which is not ensured adequately due to the aforementioned oversights.

A specific counter-example is as follows:
- Input:
```
2
20000 South
1000 East
```
Expected Output: "NO" (because Limak cannot move East while at the North Pole).
Actual Output: The program will print "YES" because it does not check for invalid East direction moves.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly verify the journey conditions as stipulated in the problem statement, making it incorrect.
