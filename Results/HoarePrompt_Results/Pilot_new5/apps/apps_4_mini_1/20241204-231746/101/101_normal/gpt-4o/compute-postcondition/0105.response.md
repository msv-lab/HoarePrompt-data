`top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. Since `top` was initially not None, it will now take the value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 2, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w', and the current value of `i` is less than `top`.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w', and the current value of `i` is less than `top`.**
