The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. The initial values are `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, and `i` is 2. Therefore, after execution, both `top` and `bottom` will be assigned the value of 2, which does not change their values. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 1**
