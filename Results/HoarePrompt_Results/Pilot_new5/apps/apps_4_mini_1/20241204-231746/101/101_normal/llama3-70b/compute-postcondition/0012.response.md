The variables `max_x` and `max_y` are updated to be the maximum of their previous values and the current values `x` and `y`. The values of `max_x` and `max_y` depend on their previous values and the current values of `x` and `y`. Since we do not have specific values for `max_x`, `max_y`, `x`, and `y`, we can only express the new values in terms of the previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must contain at least one 'w', `white_pixels` must be a list containing at least 3 tuples representing coordinates of 'w', `min_x` is updated to min(previous min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(previous min_y, y), `max_x` is updated to max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is updated to max(previous max_y, y)**
