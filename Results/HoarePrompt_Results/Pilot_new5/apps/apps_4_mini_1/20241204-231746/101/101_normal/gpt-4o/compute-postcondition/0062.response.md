Postcondition: ***`top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is None, `right` is None, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of screen[i][j] is 'w'. The current value of `j` is less than `left`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current state of the program remains unchanged.***
