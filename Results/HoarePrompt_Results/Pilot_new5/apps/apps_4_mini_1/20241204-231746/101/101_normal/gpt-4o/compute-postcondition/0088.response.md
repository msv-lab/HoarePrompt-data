The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is 1, `bottom` will also be assigned the value of 1. The other variables remain unaffected. The conditions mentioned in the initial state still hold true. 

Output State: **`top` is either 1 or equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
