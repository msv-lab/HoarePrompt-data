Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1. If the condition is true, `pixels[2][1]` is set to '+'. If the condition is false and `pixels[2][1]` is 'w', the loop continues without changes to `n`, `i`, `m`, or `j`. Otherwise, `pixels[2][1]` remains '.', and the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
