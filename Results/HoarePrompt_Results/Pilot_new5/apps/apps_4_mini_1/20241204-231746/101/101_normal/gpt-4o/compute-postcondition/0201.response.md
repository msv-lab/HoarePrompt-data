Postcondition: ***`top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is equal to `left + 2`, and `right` is greater than or equal to `left + 2`. If `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, or if `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then `result[i][j]` is updated to '+' if it was originally '.'***
