According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `left` and `right` variables. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `right`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `left + 1`. Since `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `left + 2`. For this to happen, `right` must be greater than or equal to `left + 2`.

State: **`top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `i` is equal to either `top` or `bottom`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `j` is equal to `left + 2`, and `result[i][j]` is updated to '+' if it was initially '.'**
