According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `pixels` list. If `pixels` has at least 3 rows, the loop can execute one more time to process the third row. At the end of the last iteration, `pixels` must have at least 2 rows, and `row` is the string formed by joining the elements of the second row. To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `pixels` has at least 3 rows, and the `row` must represent the third row in `pixels`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must have at least 3 rows, `row` is the string formed by joining the elements of the third row in `pixels`**
