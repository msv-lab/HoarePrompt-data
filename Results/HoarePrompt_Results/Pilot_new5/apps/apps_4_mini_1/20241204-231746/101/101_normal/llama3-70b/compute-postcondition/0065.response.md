Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m - 1`. After all iterations of the loop have executed, `pixels[i][j]` will be updated to '+' if conditions are met during the iterations, otherwise, it will maintain its original value from the `pixels` array. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `pixels[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `j`.**
