According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is at least 2. Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. Since `m` is at least 2, this condition will be satisfied.

State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 2**
