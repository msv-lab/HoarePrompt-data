Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 0. If either `i` is equal to `min_x`, or `i` is equal to `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y`, or `j` is equal to `max_y`, and if the value of `pixels[i][j]` is '+', no changes are made to `pixels[i][j]`. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is equal to 'w', the loop continues to the next iteration. If `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w', it is updated to be equal to '.'***
