To evaluate the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, let’s break down the function step-by-step.

### Analysis of the Code and Problem Description

1. **Problem Intent**: The program is supposed to find the smallest square frame (1 pixel wide) that encapsulates all 'w' (white pixels) in a given grid while ensuring that only these 'w' pixels are part of the frame. If such a frame cannot exist (like when all 'w' pixels are isolated), the program should return `-1`.

2. **Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to track the boundaries of the rectangle containing all 'w' pixels.
   - It iterates through the `screen`, updating the boundaries based on the positions of 'w'.
   - After determining the boundary positions, it checks if the frame dimensions are sufficient (height and width must be at least 2).
   - It creates a result grid by replacing '.' with '+' for the frame pixels along the calculated boundaries.

### Edge Cases to Consider

- **Single Row or Column of 'w' Pixels**: If 'w' pixels are in a single row or column, the frame cannot meet the minimum size requirement of 2x2, and the function should return `-1`. The code does handle this check correctly, returning `-1` if the width or height is less than 2.
  
- **Tight Grouping of 'w' Pixels**: If 'w' pixels are clustered tightly together, but still form a valid rectangle, the function should correctly identify the frame and produce the correct output.

- **No 'w' Pixels (Hypothetical)**: The problem guarantees at least one 'w', so we don't need to handle this case, but the code does check if `top` is still `None`.

### Review of Output Hints

The output hints state that the function correctly identifies the rectangle encapsulating all 'w' characters. It accurately notes that if the rectangle’s dimensions are less than 2, it returns `-1`, which is consistent with the output expected in edge cases.

### Conclusion

The code correctly identifies the areas needed to create the frame, and the output hints agree with the behavior of the code. The conditions specified in the problem description are adequately handled, including edge cases like single rows/columns or tightly clustered 'w' pixels.

Therefore, I conclude that the program behaves as expected in all scenarios described.

Correctness: **True**.
