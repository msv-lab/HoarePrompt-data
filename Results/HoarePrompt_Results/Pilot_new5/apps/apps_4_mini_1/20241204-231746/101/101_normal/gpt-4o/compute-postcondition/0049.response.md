According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, changing its value to 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must remain at least 2, as `i` will be 1.

State: **`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` indicate the bounding box of the 'w' characters or remain None, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `m` is the number of columns.**
