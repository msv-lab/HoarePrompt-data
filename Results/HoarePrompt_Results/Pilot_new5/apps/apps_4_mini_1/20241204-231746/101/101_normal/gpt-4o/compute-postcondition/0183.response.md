The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at position `[i][j]` in the `result` array. Given that `i` is equal to `bottom + 1` and `j` is equal to `left`, this means that the `result` array at that specific position will now hold the value `'+'.` The conditions regarding the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`top` is less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is equal to `left`, `result[i][j]` is '+'**
