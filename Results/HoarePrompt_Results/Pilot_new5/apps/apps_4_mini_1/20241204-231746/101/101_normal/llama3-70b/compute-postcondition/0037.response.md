The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no specific loop context is provided within the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2 and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
