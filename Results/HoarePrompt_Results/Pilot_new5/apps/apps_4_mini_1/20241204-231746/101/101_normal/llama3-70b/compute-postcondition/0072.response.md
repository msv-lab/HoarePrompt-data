The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition before the `continue` statement ensures that the loop continues without executing any further logic in this iteration. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
