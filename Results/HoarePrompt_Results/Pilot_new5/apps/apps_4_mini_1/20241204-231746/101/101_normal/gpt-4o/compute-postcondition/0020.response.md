Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top`, `bottom`, `left` are 0, `right` is either 0 or None, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the element at `screen[0][0]` is equal to 'w'. If `top` is None, `top` is set to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. If `top` is not None, the state remains unchanged as the condition `j > right` evaluates to false.***
