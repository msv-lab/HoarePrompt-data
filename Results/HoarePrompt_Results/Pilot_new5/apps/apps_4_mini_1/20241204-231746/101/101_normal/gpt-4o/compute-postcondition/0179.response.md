`result[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. Given that `i` is equal to `bottom + 1` and `j` is equal to `right + 1`, the specific values of `i` and `j` are now determined. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`top` is less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is equal to `right + 1`, and `result[bottom + 1][right + 1]` is '+'**
