Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is None, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, the element at `screen[0][0]` is equal to 'w', and if the current value of `j` is less than `left` (which is 0), the program will evaluate that condition as false and will not enter the if block. Thus, the state remains unchanged.***
