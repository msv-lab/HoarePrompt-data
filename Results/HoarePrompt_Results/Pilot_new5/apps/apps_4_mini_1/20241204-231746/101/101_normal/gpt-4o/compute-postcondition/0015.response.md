The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. Since we know that `j` is currently 0, `left` will now also be 0. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is None, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, the element at `screen[0][0]` is equal to 'w', and the current value of `j` is less than `left`.
