Postcondition: ***`top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is equal to `left + 1`, if `i` is equal to `top`, `i` is equal to `bottom`, `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`, then if `result[i][j]` is equal to '.', it is assigned the value '+', otherwise, `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.***
