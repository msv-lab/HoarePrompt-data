In the given code `top = bottom = i`, both `top` and `bottom` are assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is currently 0, both `top` and `bottom` will be set to 0 as well. The other variables (`n`, `left`, `right`, `m`, `j`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is either 0 or unchanged, `right` is either 0 or None, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
