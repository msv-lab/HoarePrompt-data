According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute again since there are still more iterations available. 

After the current iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2 to ensure that there are enough iterations left.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
