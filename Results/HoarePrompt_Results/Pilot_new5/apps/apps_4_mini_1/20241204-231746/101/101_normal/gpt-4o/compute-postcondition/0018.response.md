The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 0. Since `right` was previously `None`, it now takes on the value of `j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the element at `screen[0][0]` is equal to 'w'.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the element at `screen[0][0]` is equal to 'w'.**
