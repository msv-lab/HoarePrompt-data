The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `bottom` becomes 2. The other variables maintain their previous values as there are no changes to them. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 1**
