The value of `frame_height` is assigned the result of the expression `bottom - top + 1`. The variables `top` and `bottom` are not None, so the values can be used in the calculation. The other variables (`left`, `right`, `n`, and `m`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' characters, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' characters, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' characters; `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns; `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`.**
