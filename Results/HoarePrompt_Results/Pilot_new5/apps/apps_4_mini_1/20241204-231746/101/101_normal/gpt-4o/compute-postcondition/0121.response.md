The value of `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated values will reflect that `top` is now 2, which it was previously, and all other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 1**
