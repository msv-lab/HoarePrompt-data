The code `continue` does not change any variable values; it merely skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
