Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1. If `pixels[0][1]` is '+', the program executes the associated action. If `pixels[0][1]` is 'w', the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `pixels[0][1]` is '.', the loop continues with the next iteration.***
