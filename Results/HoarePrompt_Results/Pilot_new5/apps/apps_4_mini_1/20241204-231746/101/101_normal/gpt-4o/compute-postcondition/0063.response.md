The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` is currently less than `left`, which is `None`. Therefore, after the assignment, `left` will take the value of `j`, which is still valid as no further operations have changed it yet. The other variables remain unchanged, and since `i` is not greater than `bottom`, the current state of the program remains unchanged otherwise.

Output State: **`top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is None, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the current value of screen[i][j] is 'w', and the current value of `j` is less than `left`.**
