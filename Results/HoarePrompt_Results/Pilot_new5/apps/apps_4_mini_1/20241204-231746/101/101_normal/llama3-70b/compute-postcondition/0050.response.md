The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` assigns the value `'.'` to the specific location in the `pixels` array or list at indices `i` and `j`. Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code. The only change occurs in the `pixels` data structure.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0; `i` is not equal to `min_x`, `i` is not equal to `max_x`, `j` is not equal to `min_y`, `j` is not equal to `max_y`, `pixels[i][j]` is '.'**
