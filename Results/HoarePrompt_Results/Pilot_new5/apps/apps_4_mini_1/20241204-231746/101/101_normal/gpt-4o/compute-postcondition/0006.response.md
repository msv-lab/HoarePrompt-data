In the provided code, both `left` and `right` are assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` is 0. Therefore, both `left` and `right` will be set to 0. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `m`, and the element at `screen[0][0]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, the element at `screen[0][0]` is equal to 'w', and the current value of `top` is 0.**
