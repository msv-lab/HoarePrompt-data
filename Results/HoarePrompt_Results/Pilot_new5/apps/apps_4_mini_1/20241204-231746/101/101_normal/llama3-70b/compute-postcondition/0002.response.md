The code creates a list comprehension that iterates over the range of `n` and `m`, checking each element in the `pixels` list of lists. For every element that equals 'w', it adds the tuple `(i, j)` to the list `white_pixels`. 

The previous values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `white_pixels` will now be updated to include the coordinates of all the 'w' elements in the `pixels` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list of lists containing input strings, where the length of `pixels` is equal to `n`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i, j) of elements in `pixels` that are equal to 'w'.**
