In the provided code snippet, `left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 1. The other variables are not affected by this code.

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is at least 1 (remains unchanged)
   - `i` is 0 (remains unchanged)
   - `top` is 0 (remains unchanged)
   - `bottom` is 0 (remains unchanged)
   - `left` is either 0 or unchanged (will be set to j, which is 1)
   - `right` is either 0 or None (will be set to j, which is 1)
   - `m` is greater than 0 (remains unchanged)
   - `j` is 1 (remains unchanged)

2. **Impact of the code**:
   - `left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1.
   - `right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is also 1.

Since `left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `j`, their previous values (either 0 or unchanged for `left`, and either 0 or None for `right`) will be overwritten.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
