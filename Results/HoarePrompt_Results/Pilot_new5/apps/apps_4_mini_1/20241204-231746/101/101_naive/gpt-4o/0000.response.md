To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we'll review the logic of the code and consider potential edge cases.

The program attempts to find the boundaries of the smallest square frame around the white pixels ('w') on a monitor represented as a grid. It tracks the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost positions of 'w' pixels to establish the frame's boundaries. Then, it checks if the dimensions allow for a frame (minimum size of 2x2). If so, it attempts to create the frame by filling in '+' characters around the detected positions, while leaving any 'w' pixels unchanged.

### Examination of Potential Cases:

1. **Single 'w' pixel**: 
   - Input:
     ```
     1 1
     w
     ```
   - Expected output: 
     ```
     w
     ```
   - The program correctly identifies that it cannot form a frame around a single pixel and returns -1.

2. **Two 'w' pixels in a row or column**:
   - Input:
     ```
     2 2
     w.
     w.
     ```
   - Expected output:
     ```
     w+
     ++
     ```
   - The program should identify the boundaries as insufficient to form a frame (as the width or height will be less than 2) and return -1. This case is handled correctly.

3. **Non-rectangular arrangement of 'w'**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4 4
     ....
     .w..
     .w..
     ....
     ```
   - Expected output:
     ```
     .... 
     +w+.
     +w+.
     ....
     ```
   - The program correctly finds the boundaries of 'w' and constructs the frame.

4. **All pixels are 'w'**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3 3
     www
     www
     www
     ```
   - Expected output:
     ```
     +++
     +++
     +++
     ```
   - The program should return a frame, but it will create a frame of size 3, which is acceptable.

5. **No possibility of a frame (isolated 'w')**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3 3
     ...
     .w.
     ...
     ```
   - Expected output: -1, as there is no possible frame.

### Logical Flaws:
Upon examining the code, we can see that the frame's construction is dependent on the vertical and horizontal boundaries being at least 2 pixels apart. This logic is sound for creating a frame. However, if there are any pixels that are 'w' at the edges and no additional pixels outside those edges, the frame may not be fully surrounded by '.' pixels, leading to incorrect display of the frame.

### Conclusion:
While the majority of edge cases are handled correctly, we stumbled upon the scenario where a frame cannot exist due to boundaries being too close or none at all. Given that the program has a solid structure for determining potential frames but lacks to handle certain edge cases properly, specifically where boundaries may not allow for an adequate frame, I can assert that the program does not strictly adhere to the problem description for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
