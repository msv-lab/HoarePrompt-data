The value of `row` is decremented by 2. The previous value of `row` is 1, so after the operation, the new value of `row` will be -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `direction` is -1, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `row` is now -1.

Output State: **`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `direction` is -1, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is -1.**
