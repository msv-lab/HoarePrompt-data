Postcondition: ***`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `row` is 1 (increased by `direction`, which is 1), `direction` is 1, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` equals `n`. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1.***
