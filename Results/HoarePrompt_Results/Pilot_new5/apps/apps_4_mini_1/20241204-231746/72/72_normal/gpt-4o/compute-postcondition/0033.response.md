The variable `max_questions` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_questions` is now one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` retains its previous state, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` must be greater than 0, `k` must not be a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `row` is 0, `direction` is not equal to 1, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is one less than its previous value.**
