Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` retain their previous states; `m` is greater than 0; `y` is one less than its initial value; `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0; `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`; `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; `col` is 2; `max_questions` is increased by 1; if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 3`.***
