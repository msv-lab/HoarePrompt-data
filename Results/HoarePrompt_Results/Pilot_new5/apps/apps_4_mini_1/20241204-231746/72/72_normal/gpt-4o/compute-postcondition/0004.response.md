To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we analyze how the variable `full_cycles` is affected.

1. `full_cycle_length` is calculated based on the value of `n`:
   - If `n > 1`, then `full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m`.
   - If `n <= 1`, then `full_cycle_length = m`.

2. The variable `k` is divided by `full_cycle_length` using integer division (`//`), which gives the number of full cycles.

3. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` remain unchanged except for the effect of the calculation on `full_cycles`. The only value that will change is `full_cycles`, which will be assigned an integer value determined by the division.

Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged state of `n`, `m`, and `k`, while specifically noting the calculated value of `full_cycles` based on the logic provided.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned specific integers from input; `y` is decreased by 1; `full_cycle_length` is either `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` or `m` if `n <= 1; full_cycles is `k // full_cycle_length`.**
