The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned based on the output of the `input()` function, which reads a single line from standard input and splits it into separate values that are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` will now be the specific integers provided as input. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y` are assigned specific integers from input**.
