To evaluate the impact of the code snippet provided, we first analyze the initial state and the code itself:

**Initial State:**
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m`, `k`, and `y` retain their previous states, with `y` being one less than its initial value
- `remaining_questions` is defined as `k % full_cycle_length`
- `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`
- `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`

**Code:**
```
min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. The variable `min_questions` is reassigned a new value based on the expression `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`.
2. The denominator `2 * n - 2` will evaluate to a value greater than 0 since `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, this expression is valid.
3. The previous value of `min_questions` (which was equal to `full_cycles`) is now updated to the new computed value.

Other variables such as `m`, `k`, `y`, and `max_questions` remain unchanged.

**Output State:**
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` retains its previous state
- `k` retains its previous state
- `y` is one less than its initial value
- `remaining_questions` is defined as `k % full_cycle_length`
- `min_questions` is now equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`
- `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `m` retains its previous state; `k` retains its previous state; `y` is one less than its initial value; `remaining_questions` is defined as `k % full_cycle_length`; `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`; `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.**
