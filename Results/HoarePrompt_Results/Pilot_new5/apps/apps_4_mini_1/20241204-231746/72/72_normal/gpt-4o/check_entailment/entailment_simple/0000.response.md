Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum and minimum number of questions asked to the pupils based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Full Cycles**: 
   - The calculation of `full_cycles` based on `k // full_cycle_length` is correct. However, the subsequent handling of `min_questions` and `max_questions` does not accurately account for all pupils in all cases, especially when `n > 1`. 

2. **Implementation of Sergei's Questions**:
   - The logic used to calculate `sergei_questions` when `x == 0` or `x == n - 1` is flawed. The program tries to adjust for edge cases but does not guarantee correctness across the entire range of possible input values, particularly because it divides by `(2 * n - 2)`, which can lead to incorrect counts for pupils when `k` is less than the full cycle length.

3. **Looping Logic**:
   - Within the loop that handles `remaining_questions`, the increments and decrements of `max_questions` and the logic to determine when direction changes can lead to situations where pupils are not properly accounted for in terms of how many times they are asked questions.

4. **Output Order**: 
   - The program outputs `max_questions`, `min_questions`, and `sergei_questions` in the expected format, but since the calculations for `max_questions` and `min_questions` are wrong, the output does not reflect what is described in the problem statement.

5. **Potential Edge Cases**: 
   - The logic does not handle situations where `k` is significantly larger than `full_cycle_length`, leading to incorrect distributions of questions across pupils in the classroom.

Thus, due to these issues in the logic and calculations, the program does not consistently meet the requirements as stated in the problem description.
