Postcondition: ***`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 1, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, and `col` is 1. If `direction` equals 1 and `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to either -1 (if it was 1) or `n - 2` (if it was n), `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `direction` is set to -1. If `row` is not equal to `n`, the state remains unchanged. If `direction` is not equal to 1, then `row` is updated to `row + 3`, `max_questions` is one less than its previous value, and `direction` is set to 1 if `row` was equal to -1.***
