Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` retain their previous states with `y` being one less than its initial value; `remaining_questions` is defined as `k % full_cycle_length`; if `n` is greater than 1, `sergei_questions` is equal to `min_questions`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `x` is neither 0 nor `n - 1`.***
