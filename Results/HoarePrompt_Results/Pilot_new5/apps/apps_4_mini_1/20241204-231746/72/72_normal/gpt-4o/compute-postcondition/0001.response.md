The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned specific integers from input; `x` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned specific integers from input; `x` is decremented by 1.**
