Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` retain their previous states with `y` being one less than its initial value; `remaining_questions` is defined as `k % full_cycle_length`. If `x` is 0 or `n - 1`, and `n` is greater than 1, `sergei_questions` is updated based on calculations involving `full_cycles` and `n`. Otherwise, if `x` is neither 0 nor `n - 1`, `sergei_questions` is updated to the value of `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)` if `n` is greater than 1, or remains unchanged.***
