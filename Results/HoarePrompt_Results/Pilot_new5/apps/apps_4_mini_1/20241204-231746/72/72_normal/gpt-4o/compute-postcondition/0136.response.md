Postcondition: ***`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` starts at 0, `max_questions` is adjusted based on the total number of loop executions minus 1, and if `row` was -1, it is now updated to 2.***
