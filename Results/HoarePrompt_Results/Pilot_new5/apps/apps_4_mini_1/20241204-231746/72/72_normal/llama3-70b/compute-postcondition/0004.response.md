The code snippet attempts to print the values of `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked`. However, the values of `max_asked` and `min_asked` have not been provided in the initial state, so they remain undefined in the output state.

The only variable explicitly defined in the output is `sergei_asked`, which is calculated as `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)` based on the initial values of `k`, `x`, and `n`.

Since the values of `max_asked` and `min_asked` are not specified in the initial state, we will consider them as undefined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `y` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `sergei_asked` is equal to `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`, `max_asked` is undefined, `min_asked` is undefined**.
