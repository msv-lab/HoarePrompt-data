Postcondition: ***`n` retains its previous state, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` must be greater than 0, `k` must not be a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `row` is 0, `direction` is 1, `col` is 0, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. The current value of `direction` is 1.***
