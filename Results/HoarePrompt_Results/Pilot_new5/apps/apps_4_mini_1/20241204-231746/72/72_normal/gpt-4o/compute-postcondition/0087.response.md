Postcondition: ***`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `col` is 0, and `max_questions` is adjusted by decreasing it by 1. If `row` is -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 2` and `direction` is set to 1.***
