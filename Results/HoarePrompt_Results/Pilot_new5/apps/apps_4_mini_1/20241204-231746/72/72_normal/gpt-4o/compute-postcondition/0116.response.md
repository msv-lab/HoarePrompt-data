Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than 2; `k` retains its previous state; `y` is one less than its initial value; `col` is 2. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and if `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is updated to `(row + direction) - 2`. Otherwise, if `direction` is not 1 and `row` is -1, then `row` is increased by 3.***
