The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. It calculates the minimum cost to adjust the lengths of the sticks so that they are within the range of `best_t - 1` to `best_t + 1`, for `t` values ranging from 1 to 100. The function returns the value of `best_t` that results in the minimum adjustment cost and the corresponding minimum cost itself.
