The variable `best_t` is assigned the value of `t`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `current_cost`, `min_cost`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list containing `n` integers; `current_cost` is the total adjustment made based on each element of `a` compared to `t`; `min_cost` is now equal to `current_cost`; `best_t` is equal to `t`.
