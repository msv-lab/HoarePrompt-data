The `sticks` list is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `a`, and their constraints are unchanged. The only change is the order of the elements in the `sticks` list, which is now sorted. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers obtained from input.**
