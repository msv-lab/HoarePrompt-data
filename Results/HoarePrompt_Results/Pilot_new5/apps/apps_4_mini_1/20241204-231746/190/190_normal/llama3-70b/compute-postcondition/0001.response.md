The variable `sticks` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input (which is provided as a space-separated string) to integers. The input must contain `n` integers, where `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000. Each integer `a_i` in the list `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100. Therefore, `sticks` will contain `n` integers that are all positive and fall within the specified range.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input.**
