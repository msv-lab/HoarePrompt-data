Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `length` is the first element of `a`, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` remains unchanged, `current_cost` is 0, `t` is 101. The value of `length` is greater than or equal to 100 (which is t - 1).***
