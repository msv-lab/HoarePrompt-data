The variable `cost` is assigned the value of the sum of the absolute differences between each element `x` in the `sticks` list and the `mid` value. The variable `mid` is determined as the element at index `n // 2` of the `sticks` list. Since `sticks` is sorted, `mid` is the median of the list. The other variables retain their previous values, and the exact value of `cost` will be calculated based on the values in the `sticks` list and the value of `mid`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `cost` is the sum of abs(x - mid) for each x in sticks.**
