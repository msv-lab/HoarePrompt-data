The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The values of `cost`, `n`, `a`, `sticks`, `mid`, `t`, `min_t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output state indicates that `min_cost` now holds the value that was previously stored in `cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is at least 2, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is updated if `cost` is less than `min_cost`, `cost` is calculated as the sum of min(abs(x - 0), abs(x - 1)) for x in sticks, `i` is 0.**
