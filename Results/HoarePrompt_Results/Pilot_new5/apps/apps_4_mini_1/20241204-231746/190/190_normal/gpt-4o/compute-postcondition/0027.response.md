The variable `best_t` is assigned the value of `t`. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state remains largely the same, except for the updated value of `best_t`. The values for `n`, `a`, `current_cost`, and `min_cost` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing `n` integers, `current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the lengths in `a` relative to `t`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is equal to `t`.**
