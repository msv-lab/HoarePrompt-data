The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `t - 1 - length`. Given that `t` is 101 and `length` is the first element of the list `a`, the exact value of `length` is not specified but is known to be less than 100. Therefore, `current_cost` will be incremented by `101 - 1 - length`, which simplifies to `100 - length`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `length` is the first element of `a`, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` remains unchanged, `current_cost` is now equal to `current_cost + (100 - length)`, `t` is 101, and the current value of `length` is less than 100.**
