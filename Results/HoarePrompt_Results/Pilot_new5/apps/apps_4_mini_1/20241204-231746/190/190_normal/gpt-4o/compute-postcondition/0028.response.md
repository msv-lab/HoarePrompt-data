Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing `n` integers, and `current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the lengths in `a` relative to `t`. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is set to `t`. If `current_cost` is not less than `min_cost`, the values of `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
