According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `t` from 1 to 100. The range function specifies that the loop will execute as long as `t` takes values within this range. Since the starting value is 1 and the ending value is 101 (exclusive), the loop will execute if the range is valid. 

In this case, the relevant states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute are:
- The variable `t` should start at 1 (which it does).
- The loop will execute 100 times (for values of `t` from 1 to 100).

Given that `t` will initialize at 1 automatically at the start of the loop, there is no need to adjust `t`. 

Thus, states that need to be confirmed or noted are: 
- `t` is 1 at the start of the loop.
- The loop will execute as long as it iterates from 1 to 100.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list containing `n` integers which are the lengths of sticks and satisfy 1 <= a[i] <= 100 for all valid indices i, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1**
