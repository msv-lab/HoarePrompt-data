Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 1 integer, and `length` is the next integer in `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` also remain unchanged.***
