Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is at least 2, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is calculated as the sum of min(abs(x - 0), abs(x - 1)) for x in sticks. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost`, and `min_t` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.***
