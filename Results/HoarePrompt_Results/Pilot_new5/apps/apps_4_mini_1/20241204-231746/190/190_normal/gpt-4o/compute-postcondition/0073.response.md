Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `length` is the third element of `a`, which is 2 or greater. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.***
