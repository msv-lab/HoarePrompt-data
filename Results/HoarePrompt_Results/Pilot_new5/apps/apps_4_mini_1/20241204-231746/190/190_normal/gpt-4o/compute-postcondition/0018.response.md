Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers, and `length` is the second element of `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (a[1] - (t + 1))`. Otherwise, there is no change to `current_cost.***
