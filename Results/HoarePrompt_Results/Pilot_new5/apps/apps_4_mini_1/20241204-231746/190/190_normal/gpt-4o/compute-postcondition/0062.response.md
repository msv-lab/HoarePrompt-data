Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `length` is the first element of `a` and is greater than or equal to 100. If `length` is greater than 102, then `current_cost` is updated to a positive value equal to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, and `t` is 101. If `length` is less than or equal to 102, the values of `min_cost`, `best_t`, `current_cost`, and `t` remain unchanged.***
