The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `t - 1 - length` to it. The variables `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` remain unchanged. Given that `length` is the next integer in the list `a`, the exact value of `current_cost` will depend on the current values of `current_cost`, `t`, and `length`. However, the output state will reflect the change in `current_cost` based on the equation provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 1 integer, `length` is the next integer in `a`, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` remains unchanged, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`.**
