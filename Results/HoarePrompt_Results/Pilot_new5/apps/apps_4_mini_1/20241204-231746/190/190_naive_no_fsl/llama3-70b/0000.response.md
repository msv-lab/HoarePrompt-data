Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to handle cases where the cost of changing stick lengths is not minimized properly. Specifically, the program only considers the midpoint and nearby values for `t` but does not take into account that the optimal `t` could be very close to one of the existing stick lengths, and changing lengths could yield a better cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 100 100
```
In this case, the optimal choice for `t` would be `100`, as changing the stick of length `1` to `100` costs `99`, while the other sticks remain unchanged. The minimum cost would be `99`. However, the program's logic might incorrectly focus on stick lengths around the midpoint and could miss this optimal solution, depending on how it calculates costs around the midpoints.

Thus, due to the potential for suboptimal results, the program does not satisfy the correctness criteria outlined in the problem description.
