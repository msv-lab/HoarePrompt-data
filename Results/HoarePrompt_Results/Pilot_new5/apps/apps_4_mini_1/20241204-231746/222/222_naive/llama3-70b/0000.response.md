To evaluate the correctness of the provided program for the given problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it adheres to the requirements.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Inputs**: The program takes in two integers: `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of skewers affected to each side when one is turned).
2. **Output**: The program should output:
   - An integer `l`, the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers.
   - A list of integers representing the indices of the skewers that need to be turned over.

### Code Analysis

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)  # Calculate the minimum number of actions
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)  # Determine which skewer to turn
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

**Step-by-step Breakdown:**

1. The calculation of `l` is designed to determine how many times Miroslav needs to turn skewers to cover all of them. The formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` calculates how many groups of skewers can be covered in one action.
2. The loop generates the indices of the skewers to be turned based on the calculated `l`. Each turned skewer is spaced out by `(k * 2 + 1)` from the previous one.

### Edge Cases

1. **When `k = 0`**: Each skewer only turns itself. Hence, `l` should be equal to `n` and all skewers from `1` to `n` should be printed.
   - For example, for `n = 5`, `k = 0`, the output should be:
     ```
     5
     1 2 3 4 5
     ```
   - The current implementation would output `l` as `5` and indices `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which is incorrect.

2. **When `k` is large**: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n // 2`, then one turn can potentially cover many skewers. However, the current calculation does not account for this properly.
   - For example, for `n = 6`, `k = 3`, the output should be `1` (only turn skewer 3), but the code would output `2` with indices `[1, 1]`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Given the problems identified above, particularly the edge case handling when `k` is `0` or `k` is large, the implementation does not consistently provide correct results according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Reason for Incorrectness
The program fails to cover edge cases, specifically when `k` is `0` or when `k` is large relative to `n`, where it does not return the correct skewer indices that cover all skewers.
