To evaluate the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic behind it.

The problem requires turning over all skewers using the fewest number of actions, where turning a skewer affects skewers to its immediate left and right, up to `k` skewers away.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        i += 2 * k + 1
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. It reads the input values for `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of skewers affected on each side).
2. It initializes an empty list `positions` to store the indices of skewers to be turned.
3. The loop starts from the first skewer (index 1) and increments the index `i` by `2*k + 1` in each iteration. This means that it is effectively skipping `k` skewers to the left and `k` skewers to the right of the turned skewer, turning over the next skewer that can affect the next group of skewers.
4. After calculating which skewers to turn, it prints the count and the list of indices.

### Potential Issues:
1. The algorithm works correctly if `k > 0`, but there are issues when `k = 0`. In this case, each turn only affects the skewer being turned over itself, meaning every skewer must be turned individually. The current implementation will not work for `k = 0`, as it would only attempt to turn the first skewer and skip to the end.
   
   For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 0`, the expected output should be:
   ```
   5
   1 2 3 4 5
   ```
   However, the code would output:
   ```
   1
   1
   ```

2. Additionally, when `n` is not a multiple of `2*k + 1`, the algorithm does not always cover the last skewers properly because it skips indices incrementally by `2*k + 1`, potentially leaving some skewers unturned.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to satisfy the requirements for certain edge cases, particularly when `k = 0`. 

Therefore, the final assessment is:
Correctness: **False**.
