To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions given in the previous state and the loop condition:

1. The loop is defined as `while i <= n`.
2. The state indicates that `i` is equal to `4 + 4*k`, and `n` must be greater than `2*k + 2`.

For the loop to execute again, the condition `i <= n` must hold true. Given the current state, we have:

- `i = 4 + 4*k`
- `n > 2*k + 2`

We can rephrase the requirement for `i`:
- For the loop to execute, we need `4 + 4*k <= n`.

Since `n` is currently greater than `2*k + 2`, we need to ensure that `n` not only satisfies that condition but also allows `i` to be less than or equal to it. 

In order to satisfy `i <= n`, we can express it as:
- `n` needs to be at least `4 + 4*k`, which means we should adjust `n` to be at least equal to `4 + 4*k`.

Since `n` is currently greater than `2*k + 2`, we can conclude that for the loop to execute once more, it needs to be adjusted accordingly. 

Thus, the necessary adjustment to the states is:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `4 + 4*k`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `4 + 4*k`, `positions` is a list containing the values 1 and `2 + 2*k`, `i` is equal to `4 + 4*k`**
