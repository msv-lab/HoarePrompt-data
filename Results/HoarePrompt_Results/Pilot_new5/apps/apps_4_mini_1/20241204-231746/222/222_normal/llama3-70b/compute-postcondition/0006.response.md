The variable `i` is currently 1, and `k` is a non-negative integer which can range from 0 to 1000. The operation `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` calculates the value to be appended to `res`. 

- The multiplication `k * 2` gives a value that is non-negative since `k` is non-negative. This means that `k * 2` will be in the range from 0 to 2000. 
- Therefore, `k * 2 + 1` will result in a value ranging from 1 to 2001.
- Multiplying this by `i`, which is 1, keeps the value the same: `1 * (k * 2 + 1)` yields `k * 2 + 1`, which still falls within the range of 1 to 2001.
- Finally, adding 1 gives us `(k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `k * 2 + 2`.

Since `res` already includes the value 1, after the operation `res.append(k * 2 + 2)`, it will now include an additional value of `k * 2 + 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `res` includes the values 1 and `k * 2 + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `res` includes the values 1 and `k * 2 + 2.**
