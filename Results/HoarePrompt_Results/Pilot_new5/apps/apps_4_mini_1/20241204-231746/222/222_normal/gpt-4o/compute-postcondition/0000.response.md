The variable `positions` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, and `positions` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, and `positions` is an empty list.**
