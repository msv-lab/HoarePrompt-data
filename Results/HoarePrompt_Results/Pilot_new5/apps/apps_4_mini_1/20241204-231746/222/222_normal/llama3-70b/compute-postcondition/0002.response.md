The variable `res` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is equal to (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), and `res` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is equal to (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` is an empty list**.
