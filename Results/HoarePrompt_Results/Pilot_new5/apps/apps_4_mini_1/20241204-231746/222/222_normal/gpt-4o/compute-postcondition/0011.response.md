The loop iteratively appends values to the `positions` list starting from `1` and incrementing `i` by `2*k + 1` each time until `i` exceeds `n`. The number of iterations depends on the initial values of `n` and `k`.

After analyzing the loop's behavior based on the initial state and the output states after a few iterations, let's determine the final output state after the loop has executed all possible times.

1. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` does not exceed `n`. 
2. The first value appended to `positions` is `1`.
3. After each iteration, `i` is updated by adding `2*k + 1`.
4. The loop exits when `i` exceeds `n`.

Given these details, we can deduce that after executing the loop maximum times, the value of `i` will be greater than `n` while the `positions` list will contain all appended values based on the increment pattern.

The final state can be summarized as follows:

- If the loop executed `m` times, then `i` will be `1 + m*(2*k + 1)`, which must be greater than `n`.
- The values in `positions` will be a sequence of odd numbers starting from `1` and going up to `1 + (m-1)*(2*k + 1)`.

For the loop to execute `m` times, we can derive:

- Initial condition: `i` starts at `1` and after `m` iterations, `i` becomes greater than `n`, meaning `1 + m*(2*k + 1) > n`.
- The last valid value added to `positions` would be `1 + (m-1)*(2*k + 1)`.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`positions` is a list containing the first `m` values derived from `1, 1 + (2*k + 1), 1 + 2*(2*k + 1), ..., 1 + (m-1)*(2*k + 1)`, `i` is greater than `n`, where `m` is the maximum number of iterations such that `1 + m*(2*k + 1) > n`.**
