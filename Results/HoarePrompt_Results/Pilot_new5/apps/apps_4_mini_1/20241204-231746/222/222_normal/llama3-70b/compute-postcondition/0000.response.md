The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` converts the split input strings into integers. The previous conditions of `n` and `k` remain valid, but their specific values are now determined by the user's input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `n` and `k` are now equal to the input values provided.**
