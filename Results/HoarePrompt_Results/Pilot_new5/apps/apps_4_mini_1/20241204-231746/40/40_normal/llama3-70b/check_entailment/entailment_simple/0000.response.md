Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets each requirement:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads a non-empty string `s` from the input, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Palindrome Check**: The program checks for palindromic substrings by comparing each substring `substr` with its reverse (`substr[::-1]`). If they are not equal, the substring is confirmed to be non-palindromic.

3. **Finding the Longest Non-Palindromic Substring**: The nested loops generate all possible substrings of `s`, and the program tracks the length of the longest non-palindromic substring using the variable `max_len`.

4. **Output Logic**: After checking all possible substrings, the program outputs `max_len` if it is greater than 0. If all substrings are palindromic (and `max_len` remains 0), it outputs `0`, in accordance with the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles cases where:
   - The string itself is a non-palindrome (e.g., `mew`).
   - There are substrings that are non-palindromes (e.g., `wuffuw`).
   - All characters in the string are the same (e.g., `qqqqqqqq`), resulting in no non-palindromic substrings.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description, effectively identifying and measuring the longest non-palindromic substring or returning `0` when none exist, thus fulfilling the task requirements.
