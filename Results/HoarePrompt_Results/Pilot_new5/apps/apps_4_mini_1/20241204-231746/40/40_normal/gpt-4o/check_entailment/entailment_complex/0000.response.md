To determine if the provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the implementation of the program.

### Problem Requirements:
1. A string is classified as a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
2. The task is to find the longest substring of a given string that is **not** a palindrome. If all substrings are palindromes, the output should be `0`.
3. The program should handle strings of length up to 50 characters consisting of lowercase English letters.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a non-empty string `s` and strips any surrounding whitespace. This is in line with the input requirements.
2. **Length Check**: If the length of `s` is less than or equal to `1`, it prints `0`. This is correct because a single character or an empty string can't contain a non-palindromic substring.
3. **Palindrome Check**: The program uses the helper function `func_1(s)` to check if a string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
4. **Substring Checks**:
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If not, it prints the length of `s`, which is the correct longest non-palindromic substring.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it checks the substring `s[1:]` (i.e., removing the first character) and then `s[:-1]` (i.e., removing the last character). If either of those substrings is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s` minus 1.
   - If all possible checks (the entire string and both substrings) return that they are palindromes, it correctly outputs `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles:
- Cases where the string itself is non-palindromic.
- Cases where the string is a palindrome but can become non-palindromic by removing either the first or last character.
- Cases where all substrings are palindromes (e.g., "aaaa").

Thus the program adheres to the problem's requirements and handles all specified scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **True**
