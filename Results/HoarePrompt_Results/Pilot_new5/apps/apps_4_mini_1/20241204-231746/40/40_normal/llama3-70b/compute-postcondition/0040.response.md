The variable `substr` is updated to the value of `s[i:j]`, where `i` is 2 and `j` is 4. This means `substr` will now hold the substring of `s` from index 2 to index 4 (not inclusive). Since `s` is a non-empty string with length `n` (where `n ≥ 4`), the substring will consist of the characters at indices 2 and 3 of `s`. The values of `max_len`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, while `substr` is updated.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` (where n ≥ 4); `substr` is equal to `s[2:4]`; `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1; `i` is 2; `j` is 4.**
