Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `s` with a maximum length of 50 characters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and `False` otherwise. It does not handle any special cases for empty strings since `s` is guaranteed to be non-empty based on the input constraints. **
