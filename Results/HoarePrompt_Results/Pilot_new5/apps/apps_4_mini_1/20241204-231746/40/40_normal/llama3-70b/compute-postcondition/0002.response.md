The variable `max_len` is initialized to `0`. The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new value of `max_len`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters; `n` is the length of `s`, a positive integer; `max_len` is 0.**
