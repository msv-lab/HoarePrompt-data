According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1`, which means in the first iteration `j` is 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, and `n` is the length of the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, leading to `j` being 2. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `n` is the length of the non-empty string, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, if `j` becomes 2, the condition is still valid as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `substr` is the first character of `s`.**
