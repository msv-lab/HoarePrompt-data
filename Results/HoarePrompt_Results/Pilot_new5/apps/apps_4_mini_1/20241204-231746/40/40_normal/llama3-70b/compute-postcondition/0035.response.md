`substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`, which is `s[2:3]`. This means `substr` will be a single character since `j` is exclusive. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `substr` is equal to `s[2:3]`**.
