According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is the length of the string `s`, which is non-empty, the loop can run again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain unchanged, as it represents the length of the string `s`, which is still non-empty. The variable `substr` remains the entire string `s`, and we are focused on the next position for `i` in the loop.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, and `substr` is the entire string `s`.**
