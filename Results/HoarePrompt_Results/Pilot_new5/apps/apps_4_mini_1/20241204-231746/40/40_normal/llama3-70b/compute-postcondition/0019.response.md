To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the states and the loop structure step by step.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):`, which means it will iterate from `i + 1` to `n`. Given that `i` is currently 1, the initial value of `j` will start from `2` (since `i + 1` equals `2`) and go up to `n` (inclusive).

2. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `j` (which is `i + 1` or `2`) must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `2`. This means that if the length of string `s` is less than `2`, the loop will not execute.

3. The current states of `i` and `j` need to be clarified. Since `i` is `1`, it indicates the starting point for `j`. The loop will begin with `j` being `2`.

4. The substring `substr` is the entire string `s`, but it does not directly influence whether the loop will execute. However, `max_len` being the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome might be relevant for how the loop is utilized later.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be at least `2` to ensure that `j` can start from `2` and go up to `n`.
- `i` is already `1`.
- `j` will be initialized to `2` at the start of the loop.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, and `substr` is the entire string `s`.**
