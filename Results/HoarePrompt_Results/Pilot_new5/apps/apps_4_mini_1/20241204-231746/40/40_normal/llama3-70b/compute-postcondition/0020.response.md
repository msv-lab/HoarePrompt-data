The variable `substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting from index `i` to index `j`, which corresponds to the characters at positions 1 and 2 of `s` (since indexing starts at 0). Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, `substr` will be equal to the second character of `s`. The length of `s` is at least 2, so this operation is valid. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that must be at least 2; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome; `substr` is the second character of `s`.**
