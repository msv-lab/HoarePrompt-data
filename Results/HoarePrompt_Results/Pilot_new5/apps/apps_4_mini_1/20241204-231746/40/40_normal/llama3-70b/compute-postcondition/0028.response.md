According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop is set to execute while `j` is in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, meaning that the next value for `j` will be 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`, which is at least 3 (as `s` has length `n`, which is at least 3). Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `substr` is the substring `s[1:3]`, `max_len` remains unchanged**
