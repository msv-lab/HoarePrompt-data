According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is the length of the string `s`. Since `n` is a positive integer and represents the length of `s`, it will always be at least 1 as `s` is a non-empty string. The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and will represent the current index of the iteration. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the value of `i` should be set to 0, and since `n` is already a positive integer corresponding to the length of `s`, we do not need to modify `n`. The `max_len` variable does not affect the loop execution.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0**
