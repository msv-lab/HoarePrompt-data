To evaluate the provided program based on the problem description and check if it meets the requirements, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func`.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to find the longest substring of a string `s` that is **not** a palindrome.
2. If all substrings are palindromes, the output should be `0`.

### Program Analysis:
The function reads a string and calculates the length of the longest non-palindromic substring by checking every possible substring:
- It iterates through all possible substrings of the input string `s`.
- It checks if each substring is not equal to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`).
- If a substring is not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` with the maximum length found.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Input: "aa"** - The only substrings are "a", "a", and "aa" which are all palindromes. The expected output is `0`.
2. **Input: "ab"** - The substrings are "a", "b", and "ab". Here, "ab" is not a palindrome and has length `2`. The expected output is `2`.
3. **Input: "a"** - The only substring is "a", which is a palindrome. The expected output is `0`.
4. **Input: "aaaaaa"** - All substrings are palindromes (e.g., "a", "aa", "aaa", etc.). The expected output is `0`.

### Incorrect Cases:
Let's consider the specific case of a string where all characters are the same:
- **Input: "aaaaaa"**
    - The program will iterate through all substrings of "aaaaaa". Since every substring is a palindrome, it will never update `max_len` from its initial value of `0`.
    - The output will be `0`, which is correct according to the problem description.

However, there's an issue with the handling of strings with only one character:
- **Input: "a"**
    - The only substring "a" is a palindrome.
    - The expected output is `0`, which the program correctly provides.

### Edge Case - Non-Palindromic Scenarios:
Now let's examine a case where the function does not return the intended output:
- **Input: "mew"** - The substring "mew" itself is not a palindrome and should return `3`. The program correctly outputs `3`.
  
Overall, the program implements the core logic correctly for the given problem description, but it does not correctly manage edge cases where all characters are the same, and all substrings are palindromes, or strings with single characters.

### Conclusion:
There are no edge cases where the program logically fails based on the description provided. It handles both palindromic and non-palindromic substrings correctly. Since it produces the correct results for all inputs considered:

Correctness: **True**.
