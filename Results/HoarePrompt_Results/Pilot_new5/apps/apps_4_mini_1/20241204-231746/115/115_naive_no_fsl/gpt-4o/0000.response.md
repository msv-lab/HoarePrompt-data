Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the matrix A has isolated `1`s that are not part of any `2x2` submatrix. For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

In this case, the `1`s in the corners cannot be formed into `2x2` submatrices. The program will iterate through the matrix and find that it cannot create a `2x2` submatrix for these `1`s and will thus skip them. When it checks the final condition to see if `A` is equal to `B`, it will find that they are not equal, and return `-1`.

However, according to the problem description, the output should be `-1` only if it is impossible to make matrix `B` equal to matrix `A` through the allowed operations. Since the program does not account for all scenarios where isolated `1`s exist, this leads to incorrect behavior, thus making the program incorrect. 

Therefore, the program fails on this edge case, demonstrating that it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
