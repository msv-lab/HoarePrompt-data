To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and check if it adheres to the requirements of the problem.

The problem requires us to determine whether we can transform a matrix \( B \) (initially filled with zeros) into a matrix \( A \) (which may contain ones and zeros) using a series of operations that set specific 2x2 submatrices of \( B \) to ones.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes matrix \( B \) as a zero matrix of the same dimensions as \( A \).

2. **Operation Selection**:
   - The program loops through each potential top-left corner of a 2x2 submatrix in matrix \( A \) (i.e., it iterates through indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( i < n-1 \) and \( j < m-1 \)).
   - If the 2x2 block in \( A \) at position \( (i, j) \) is composed entirely of ones, it marks the corresponding 2x2 block in \( B \) as ones and records the operation.

3. **Final Verification**:
   - After attempting to form \( B \), the program checks if \( A \) and \( B \) are equal. If they are not equal, it returns -1 indicating that the transformation is impossible.

### Potential Case of Failure

Letâ€™s consider an edge case where matrix \( A \) has isolated ones that cannot be covered by any 2x2 block. For example:

- Input:
```
3 3
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 1 1
```

- Expected Output: -1 (since the `1` at `(3, 1)` cannot be transformed by any operation)
  
In this case, the program would not select any operations because it only checks for full 2x2 blocks of ones. Thus, even though it checks for equality at the end, it would not recognize that it is impossible to transform \( B \) to match \( A \) when the `1` in the last row is isolated.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle cases where isolated ones exist in matrix \( A \) that cannot be formed by any 2x2 operation. Therefore, it fails to correctly determine the possibility of transforming \( B \) into \( A \) for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
