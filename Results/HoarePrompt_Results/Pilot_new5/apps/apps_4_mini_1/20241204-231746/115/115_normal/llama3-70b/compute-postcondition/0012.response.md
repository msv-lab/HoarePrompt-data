The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the output state will indicate that the loop continues as expected.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ops` is an empty list and the loop continues.**
