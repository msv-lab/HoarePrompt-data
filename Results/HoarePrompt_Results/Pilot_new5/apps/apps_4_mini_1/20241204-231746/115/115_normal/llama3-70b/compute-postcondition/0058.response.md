Postcondition: ***`n` is 3 or greater, `m` is greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If any of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, then the tuple (3, 3) is appended to `ops`. Otherwise, the program skips this conditional block.***
