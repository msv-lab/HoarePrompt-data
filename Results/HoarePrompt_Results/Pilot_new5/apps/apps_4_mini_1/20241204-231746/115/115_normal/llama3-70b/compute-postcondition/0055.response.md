The `continue` statement does not modify any variables, but it alters the flow of control in the program by skipping the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceeding directly to the next iteration. Since no variables have changed, we retain all existing information.

Output State: **`n` is 3 or greater, `m` must be greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
