According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop has executed for `i` equal to 0 and 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. Given that `n` is currently 2 or greater, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (since `n - 1` should be greater than `i`).

State: **`n` must be 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` list remains unchanged.**
