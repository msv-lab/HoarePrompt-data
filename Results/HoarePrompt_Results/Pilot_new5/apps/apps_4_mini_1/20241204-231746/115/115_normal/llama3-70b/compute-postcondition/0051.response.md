Postcondition: ***`n` is 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and if `A[2][1]`, `A[3][1]`, `A[2][0]`, and `A[3][0]` are all equal to 1, the `ops` list is appended with (3, 1). If any of these conditions are not met, the `ops` list remains unchanged.***
