According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 1` is at least 0. Given that `m` is between 2 and 50, this means that `m - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute as is.

At the start of the loop, `j` needs to represent the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `ops` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
