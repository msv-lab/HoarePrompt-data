Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and 2 <= `m` <= 50; `B` contains the counts of 2x2 blocks of 1s from `A` for rows `n-1` and `n`, columns `0` to `m-2`, and `operations` contains tuples of positions (1-based indexing) for each identified 2x2 block where all four elements are 1. If no blocks were found, `B` remains unchanged and `operations` is empty.**
