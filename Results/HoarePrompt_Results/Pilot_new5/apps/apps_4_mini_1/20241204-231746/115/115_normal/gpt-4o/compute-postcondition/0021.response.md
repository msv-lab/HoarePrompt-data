The operation `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i` and `j` are `n - 1` and `0`, respectively. Therefore, `i + 1` will be `n` and `j + 1` will be `1`. 

The previous state of the variables remains unchanged except for `operations`, which now contains the new tuple.

The updated information is:
- `operations` now includes the tuple `(n, 1)`.
- `i` is still `n - 1`.
- `j` is still `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` has `B[n - 1][0] = 1`, `B[n - 1][1] = 1`, `B[n][0] = 1`, `B[n][1] = 1`, `operations` is now a list of tuples including the new tuple `(n, 1)`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0.**
