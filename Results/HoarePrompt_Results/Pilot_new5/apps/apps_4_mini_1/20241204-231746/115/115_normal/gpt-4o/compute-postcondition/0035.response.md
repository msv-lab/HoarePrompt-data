The code assigns the value 1 to the elements of the array `B` at the specified indices based on the current values of `i` and `j`. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is 0, the specific indices being modified are `B[n - 1][0]`, `B[n - 1][1]`, `B[n][0]`, and `B[n][1]`. The values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` being 1 indicates that these indices are valid and the operations can be performed without error. 

The state of other variables and conditions remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, `B[n - 1][0]` is 1, `B[n - 1][1]` is 1, `B[n][0]` is 1, `B[n][1]` is 1.**
