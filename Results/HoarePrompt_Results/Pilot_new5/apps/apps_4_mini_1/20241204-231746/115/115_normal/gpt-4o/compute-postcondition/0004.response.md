Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, each element is 0, `j` is 0, and the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1.***
