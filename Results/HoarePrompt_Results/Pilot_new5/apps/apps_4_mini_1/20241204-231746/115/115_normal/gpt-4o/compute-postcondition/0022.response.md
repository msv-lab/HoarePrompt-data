Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and 2 <= `m` <= 50. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `B` has `B[n - 1][0] = 1`, `B[n - 1][1] = 1`, `B[n][0] = 1`, `B[n][1] = 1`, and `operations` includes the new tuple `(n, 1)`. Otherwise, there is no change to `B` or `operations`.***
