According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making it 1. Since `m` has a minimum value of 2, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1, which it is.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` contains one tuple: `(i + 1, 1)`, `B` has the same dimensions as `A`, with all elements being 0 except for `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, and `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`, which are all equal to 1, `j` is 1**
