According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1 (since `j` must be less than `m - 1`, meaning `m` must be at least 2).

State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `ops` is an empty list.**
