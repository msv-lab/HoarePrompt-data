The code snippet initializes an empty list called `operations`. This does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or `A`, as it only affects the `operations` variable.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1; `operations` is an empty list.**
