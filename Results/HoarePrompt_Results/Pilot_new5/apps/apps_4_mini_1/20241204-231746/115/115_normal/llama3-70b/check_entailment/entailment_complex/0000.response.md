Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to check whether matrix B can be transformed into matrix A according to the problem description.

Here's why it does not meet the requirements:

1. **Missing Logic for Initializing Matrix B**: The program does not create or maintain the state of matrix B, which is initially filled with zeros. It only processes matrix A and attempts to identify positions in A that could potentially be used to determine operations on B.

2. **Incorrect Operation Tracking**: The operations appended to the `ops` list are based solely on whether at least one of the cells in the 2x2 block of A is 1. However, the problem requires that a 2x2 operation can only be applied when all four corresponding cells in A are 1. The program does not ensure that it can fill matrix B to match the required structure of matrix A.

3. **Output Condition**: The program does not output `-1` when it is impossible to transform matrix B into matrix A. Simply counting positions where A has at least one 1 does not suffice for confirming that B can be made equal to A.

4. **Cases of Impossibility Ignored**: The program does not handle cases where specific configurations of A cannot be achieved by applying 2x2 operations on B. For example, if A has 1s scattered or not forming acceptable 2x2 blocks, the program fails to identify this as impossible.

To summarize, the program lacks the necessary logic to effectively transform B into A based on the problem constraints and does not correctly validate if such a transformation is possible. Thus, it fails to meet the problem description requirements.
