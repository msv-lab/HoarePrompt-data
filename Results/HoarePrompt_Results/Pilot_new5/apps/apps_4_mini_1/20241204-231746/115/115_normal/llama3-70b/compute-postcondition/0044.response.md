The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the execution of the `continue` command does not change any variable values. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` list remains unchanged, the value at `A[2][0]` is 1, the value at `A[3][0]` is 1, the value at `A[2][1]` is 1, and the value at `A[3][1]` is 1. The `continue` statement does not have any effect as it does not alter the state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` list remains unchanged, the value at `A[2][0]` is 1, the value at `A[3][0]` is 1, the value at `A[2][1]` is 1, and the value at `A[3][1]` is 1.**
