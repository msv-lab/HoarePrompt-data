Postcondition: ***`n` must be 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` list remains unchanged. If `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all equal to 1, then the condition is satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied, the values in `A` and `ops` remain unchanged.***
