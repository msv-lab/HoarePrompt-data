Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1` after all iterations of the loop have executed. The `ops` list contains tuples (2, k) for each column `k` where at least one of the elements `A[1][k]`, `A[2][k]`, `A[1][k + 1]`, or `A[2][k + 1]` is equal to 1. If `m` is 2, the loop executes only once; if `m` is greater than 2, the loop executes `m - 1` times.**
