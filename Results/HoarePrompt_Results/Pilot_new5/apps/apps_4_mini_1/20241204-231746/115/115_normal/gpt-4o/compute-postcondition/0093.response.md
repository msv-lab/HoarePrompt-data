The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. The parameters `n` and `m` are integers such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 50\). The parameter `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1. After executing the function body, it can return -1 under multiple cases indicating various conditions related to the elements of the 2D list `A`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `m` along with a 2D list `A`, and return -1 under certain conditions that indicate discrepancies in the elements of the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer), m (integer), and A (2D list of integers), and returns -1 under various conditions indicating discrepancies in the elements of the 2D list A.**
