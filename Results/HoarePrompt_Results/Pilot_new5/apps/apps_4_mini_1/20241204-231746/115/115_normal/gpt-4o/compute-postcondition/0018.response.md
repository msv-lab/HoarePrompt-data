To determine what states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we analyze the given program state and the loop:

1. The loop statement is `for j in range(m - 1):`. 
2. The variable `j` is initialized and iterates from 0 to `m - 2`, which means the loop will execute if `m - 1` is at least 1. 
3. Given the constraint that `m` is an integer such that `2 <= m <= 50`, it follows that `m - 1` will always be at least 1 in this case, ensuring the loop can execute.

Next, we examine the initial state of the variables:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50.
- `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50.
- `A` is a 2D list with dimensions `n` x `m`.
- `B` is a 2D list reflecting the counts of 2x2 blocks in `A` where all elements are 1.
- `operations` is a list of tuples for the positions of those blocks.
- `i` is initialized to `n - 1`, which means it is the index of the last row in the 2D list `A`.

Since the loop iterates over `j` and there are no dependencies on `A`, `B`, or `operations` for this specific loop (based on the provided information), the states of these variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

However, we do need to specify the starting condition for `j`:
- Before the loop starts, `j` is implicitly initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

Consequently, the final state will reflect that `j` is starting at 0 for the loop execution. There is no need to change other state variables since they are adequate for the loop to proceed. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0**
