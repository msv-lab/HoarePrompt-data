To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to evaluate whether the program correctly implements the required functionality of transforming matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) using the specified operations.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   The program reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the matrix and then the matrix \( A \). This part correctly captures the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Matrix Initialization**:
   The program initializes matrix \( B \) as a zero matrix of the same dimensions as \( A \). This aligns with the requirement that \( B \) should initially contain only zeros.

3. **Operation Identification**:
   The nested loops iterate over possible top-left corners of \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices in \( A \). If all four elements of the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix in \( A \) are 1s, the program marks the corresponding \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix in \( B \) as 1s and records the operation.

4. **Verification of Equality**:
   After attempting to create \( B \) from \( A \) using the identified operations, the program checks if the resulting matrix \( B \) equals matrix \( A \). If any element does not match, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to transform \( B \) into \( A \) using the allowed operations. If they match, it prints the number of operations and their details.

### Correctness Evaluation

- The program correctly identifies and applies the operations needed to turn \( B \) into \( A \) using the \( 2 \times 2 \) transformation rule.
- The loop checks only for \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices, which is appropriate since thatâ€™s the only allowed operation.
- The program ensures that all elements in \( B \) match those in \( A \) after applying the operations, thus adhering to the requirement that the two matrices must be equal.

### Edge Cases

- **All Zeros**: If \( A \) is a matrix of all zeros, the program correctly outputs 0 operations, which is valid.
- **Irreversible Configurations**: If matrix \( A \) contains single ones that cannot form a \( 2 \times 2 \) block (e.g., isolated ones), the program will return -1, which reflects that it is indeed impossible to achieve the desired configuration.

### Conclusion

The provided program meets the problem description's requirements and handles all edge cases as per the specified rules. Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
