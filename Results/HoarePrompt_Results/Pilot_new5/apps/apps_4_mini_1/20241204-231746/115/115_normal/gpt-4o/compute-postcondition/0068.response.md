According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to run again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and A[i][j] is equal to B[i][j] for all j from 0 to m-1**
