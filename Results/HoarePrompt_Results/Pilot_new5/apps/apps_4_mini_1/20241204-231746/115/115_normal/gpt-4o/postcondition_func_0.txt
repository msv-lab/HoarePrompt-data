The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A` of integers consisting of 0s and 1s. It identifies all 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, marking their positions in a new 2D list `B`. If any element in `A` does not match the corresponding element in `B`, the function returns -1. If all elements match, it prints the number of identified 2x2 blocks and their 1-based positions. The function does not return any value other than -1 for discrepancies, and it assumes `n` and `m` are always within the specified range.
