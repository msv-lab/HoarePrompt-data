Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and 2 <= `m` <= 50; `B` reflects the counts of all identified 2x2 blocks of 1s from `A`, `operations` is a list of tuples containing the positions of those blocks in 1-based indexing. If no 2x2 blocks are found, `B` remains a 2D list of zeros and `operations` is empty.**
