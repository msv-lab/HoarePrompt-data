To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and ensure that it finds a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number.

The key points from the problem description are:
1. We need to output an integer `m` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\).
2. The expression \(n \cdot m + 1\) must yield a non-prime number.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

### Analyzing the Code
1. The input `n` is read and is expected to be between 1 and 1000.
2. The program iterates over integers `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. For each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if the result is not a prime number using the function `func_1`.
4. If a non-prime number is found, it prints `m` and breaks the loop.

### Checking for Edge Cases
- **Case when n = 1**: 
  - For `m = 1`, \(1 \cdot 1 + 1 = 2\) (which is prime).
  - For `m = 2`, \(1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3\) (which is prime).
  - For `m = 3`, \(1 \cdot 3 + 1 = 4\) (which is not prime). The program will correctly print `3`.
  
- **Case when n = 2**: 
  - For `m = 1`, \(2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3\) (which is prime).
  - For `m = 2`, \(2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5\) (which is prime).
  - For `m = 3`, \(2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7\) (which is prime).
  - For `m = 4`, \(2 \cdot 4 + 1 = 9\) (which is not prime). The program will correctly print `4`.

- **Case when n = 3**:
  - For `m = 1`, \(3 \cdot 1 + 1 = 4\) (which is not prime). The program will print `1`.

### General Observations
The function `func_1` correctly checks for prime numbers, and the loop guarantees that it will find an `m` where \(n \cdot m + 1\) is not prime for all valid values of `n`.

### Conclusion
The code handles all cases where \(n\) is between 1 and 1000 and correctly finds a suitable `m` such that \(n \cdot m + 1\) is not prime.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
Correctness: **True**.
