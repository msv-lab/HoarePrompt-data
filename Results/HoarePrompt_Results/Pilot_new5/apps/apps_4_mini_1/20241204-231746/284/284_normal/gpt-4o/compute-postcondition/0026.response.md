Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `x` and checks if it is a prime number. It returns False if `x` is less than or equal to 1, or if `x` is even or divisible by 3 (except for 2 and 3 themselves). If `x` is greater than 3 and passes these checks, it further verifies that it is not divisible by any integers up to its square root. If all checks are passed, it returns True, indicating that `x` is a prime number; otherwise, it returns False. Additionally, the function does not handle the special case of `x` being 2 or 3 explicitly, which should return True as they are prime numbers.**
