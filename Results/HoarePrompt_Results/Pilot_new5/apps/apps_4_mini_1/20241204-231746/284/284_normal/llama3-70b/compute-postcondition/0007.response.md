According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the condition defined in the `range`. The loop starts with `i` set to 2 and iterates while `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `num` is not divisible by `i`, which means `num` is odd. Since `num` is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, the upper limit for the loop iteration is `int(num ** 0.5)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is for `num` to remain unchanged, and `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 3 (which is true since `num` is at least 4).

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `i` is 3, and `num` is not divisible by `i` (i.e., `num % 3 != 0`).**
