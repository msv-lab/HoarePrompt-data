#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the pond, r is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net, and k is a positive integer representing the number of distinct fishes to be placed in the pond, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 100000).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the original integer value, `m` is the original integer value, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `n * m` elements: (-coverage(x, y), x, y) for all combinations of `x` in range(n) and `y` in range(m).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the original integer value, `m` is the original integer value, `r` is a positive integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `total_coverage` is the negative sum of the first `k` `cov` values from the heap, loop counter is `k`, `cov`, `x`, `y` are the values from the last popped element of the heap.
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the total coverage divided by the total positions, where total coverage is the negative sum of the first k cov values from the heap, and total positions is equal to (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` and `m` which define the dimensions of a pond, `r` which defines the size of a scoop-net, and `k` which specifies the number of distinct fishes to be placed in the pond. The function calculates the total coverage based on the highest `k` coverage values from all positions in the pond and divides this total coverage by the number of valid positions for placing the scoop-net, which is determined by the formula `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. If `k` is greater than the number of positions with coverage values in the heap, the function will only sum available values. The function returns the average coverage per valid position, while potential edge cases involving negative or zero values for `total_positions` are not explicitly handled.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing coordinates within the bounds of the pond, where 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m, and n, m, and r are positive integers with 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns the area of a rectangle defined by the bounds based on the coordinates (x, y) and the radius r, within the limits of the pond dimensions (n, m)
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, representing coordinates, and calculates the area of a rectangle defined by these coordinates and a radius `r`, constrained within the bounds of a pond of dimensions `n` by `m`. The function returns the area, which can potentially be negative if the calculated bounds are invalid; however, the area will default to zero if the rectangle defined by coordinates and radius does not have a valid positive area.
