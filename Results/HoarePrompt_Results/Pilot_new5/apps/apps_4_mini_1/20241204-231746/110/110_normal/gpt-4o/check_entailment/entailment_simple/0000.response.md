To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and functionality of the program in relation to the requirements outlined.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads four integers `n`, `m`, `r`, `k` from input, which represent the dimensions of the pond, the size of the scoop-net, and the number of fishes to place, respectively. This aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Coverage Calculation**:
    - The `coverage(x, y)` function is designed to calculate how many positions can be covered by placing the scoop with its bottom-left corner at `(x, y)` within the pond's boundaries. This is essential for determining where to place the fishes to maximize the expected catch. The calculations utilize the minimum and maximum limits based on the size of the pond and scoop, ensuring that the scoop does not exceed the pond dimensions.
  
3. **Heap Usage**:
    - The program employs a heap to prioritize the positions `(x, y)` based on their coverage (the number of fishes that could be caught if the scoop were placed there). The negative sign (`-coverage(x, y)`) allows the heap to function as a max-heap based on coverage values. It selects the positions with the highest coverage to place the fishes.

4. **Total Coverage Calculation**:
    - After determining the top `k` positions with the highest coverage, the program sums the coverage values (`total_coverage`) and divides this by the total possible positions of the scoop (`total_positions`). This results in the average expected number of caught fishes.

5. **Output**:
    - Finally, the function returns the expected value formatted to 10 decimal places, which satisfies the requirement of maintaining a precision of \(10^{-9}\).

### Conclusion:
The program implements the logic required to maximize the expected number of caught fishes by considering the coverage of each potential fish placement location. It ensures that:
- The scoop fits within the pond.
- The fishes are placed in a way that maximizes the average catch.

### Final Evaluation:
The program adheres to the problem description and handles all edge cases as described. Thus, it provides the correct output as per the outlined requirements.

Correctness: **True**
