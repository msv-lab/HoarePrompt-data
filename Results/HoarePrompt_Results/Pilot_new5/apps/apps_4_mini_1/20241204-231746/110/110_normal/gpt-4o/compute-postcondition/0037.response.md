`total_positions` is assigned the value of the expression `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are all integers, and `r` is less than or equal to both `n` and `m` since `r` is a positive integer. Therefore, `total_positions` will be calculated based on these values. The states of the other variables (`k`, `total_coverage`, `cov`, `x`, `y`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is the original integer value, `m` is the original integer value, `r` is a positive integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `total_positions` is equal to `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, `total_coverage` is the negative sum of the first `k` `cov` values from the heap, `cov`, `x`, `y` are the values from the last popped element of the heap.**
