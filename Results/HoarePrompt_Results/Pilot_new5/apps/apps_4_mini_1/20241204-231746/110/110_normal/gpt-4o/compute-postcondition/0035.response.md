The statement `total_coverage -= cov` decreases the value of `total_coverage` by the value of `cov`. The initial value of `total_coverage` is `-2 * cov`, so after subtracting `cov`, we have:

\[
total\_coverage = -2 * cov - cov = -3 * cov
\]

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is the original integer value, `m` is the original integer value, `r` is a positive integer, `k` must be greater than 1, loop counter is 2, `cov` is the new value from the heap, `x` is the new value from the heap, `y` is the new value from the heap, `total_coverage` is -3 * `cov`.**
