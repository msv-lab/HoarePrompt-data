The values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` are assigned from the popped element of the heap. The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged, as the operation only affects `cov`, `x`, and `y`. The specific values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` after popping from the heap will replace the previous values they held.

Output State: **`n` is the original integer value, `m` is the original integer value, `r` is a positive integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `total_coverage` is -cov, loop counter is 1, `cov`, `x`, `y` are updated to the values from the popped element of the heap.**
