The function accepts four non-negative integer inputs from the user (`cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4`) and checks if the sum of `cnt1` and `cnt2` equals the sum of `cnt3` and `cnt4`, while also verifying if `cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt3`. It prints `1` if both conditions are satisfied; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value.
