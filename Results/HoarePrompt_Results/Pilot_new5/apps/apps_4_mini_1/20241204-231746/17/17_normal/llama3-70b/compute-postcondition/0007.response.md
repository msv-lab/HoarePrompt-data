Functionality: ** The function accepts four non-negative integers `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` (inputted by the user) and prints 0 if `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`, otherwise it prints 1. The value of `cnt2` and `cnt4` is inputted but not used in any computation or condition within the function. **
