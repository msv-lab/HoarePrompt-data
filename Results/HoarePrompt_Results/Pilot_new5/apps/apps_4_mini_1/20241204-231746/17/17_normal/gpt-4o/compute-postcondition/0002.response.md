The variable `cnt_3` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts a user input and converts it to an integer. The previous values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_4` remain unchanged, while `cnt_3` will now hold the integer value provided by the user. The preconditions still apply, indicating that `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_4` maintain their original constraints.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer**
