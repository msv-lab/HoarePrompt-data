To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop is controlled by the `range(i + 2, n)`, which means it will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Given the conditions:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters,
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`,
- `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`,
- `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character,
- `right` equals `n`,
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated,
- `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 3`,
- `j` is `i + 3`,
- If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is the previous `beauty` + 1; otherwise, `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `i - 1` and moving backwards, or 1 if the loop did not execute.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Since at the end of the last iteration `j` is `i + 3`, for the next iteration, `j` should be `i + 4`. This means we are checking the next character in the string `s` that is `i + 4` positions from the start.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 3`, `j` is `i + 4`, and `beauty` will be updated based on whether `s[j]` is 'G' or 'S'**
