Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the maximum beauty score achievable by swapping one 'G' with an 'S'. The current implementation only checks for the case where a 'G' is followed by an 'S', but it does not consider the case where a 'G' is not followed by an 'S' but can still be swapped with an 'S' to achieve a higher beauty score.

In the problem description, it is stated that Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible. However, the program only checks for adjacent swaps. To correctly implement the problem description, the program should check all possible swaps, not just adjacent ones.

For example, consider the input "SGGGGGS". The program will not consider swapping the first 'S' with the last 'S' to get "GGGGGSS", which would increase the beauty score. Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description says, and its correctness is **False**.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to check all possible swaps, not just adjacent ones. This can be achieved by using nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs of indices in the string, and checking the beauty score for each possible swap. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look like:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            max_beauty += 1
        else:
            break

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if s[i]!= s[j] and s[i] == 'S':
                new_s = list(s)
                new_s[i], new_s[j] = new_s[j], new_s[i]
                new_s = ''.join(new_s)
                beauty = 0
                max_local_beauty = 0
                for k in range(n):
                    if new_s[k] == 'G':
                        beauty += 1
                        max_local_beauty = max(max_local_beauty, beauty)
                    else:
                        beauty = 0
                max_beauty = max(max_beauty, max_local_beauty)
    print(max_beauty)
```
This corrected version of the function will consider all possible swaps, not just adjacent ones, and will correctly calculate the maximum beauty score achievable by swapping one 'G' with an 'S'.
