The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 0, so the new value of `curr_beauty` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains the original value, `s` remains the original string, `golden` remains the list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, `right` remains its original value, and `left` remains its original value which is either the index of the first 'G' character in `s` from the left (if such a character exists and is before `right`), or `left` equals `right` (if no 'G' character is found before `right`), and the current value of `left` is less than the current value of `right`.
Output State: **`n` remains the original value, `s` remains the original string, `golden` remains the list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, `right` remains its original value, and `left` is either the index of the first 'G' character in `s` from the left (if such a character exists and is before `right`), or `left` equals `right` (if no 'G' character is found before `right`), and `left` < `right`.**
