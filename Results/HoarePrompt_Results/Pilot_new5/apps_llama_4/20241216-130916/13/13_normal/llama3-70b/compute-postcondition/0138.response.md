The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Given the initial state, `beauty` is either 2 or 3. 

If the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 3. After incrementing by 1, `beauty` becomes 4.

Otherwise, if we are still in the loop, `beauty` is 2. After incrementing by 1, `beauty` becomes 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 4, otherwise if we are still in the loop, `beauty` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 4, otherwise if we are still in the loop, `beauty` is 3**
