According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the loop range. If `j` is greater than -1 in the next iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i - 2`, which means `j` must be at least 1 to execute the loop again because `i` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1. So, in the next iteration, `j` will be `i - 3`. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 3, otherwise if we are still in the loop, `beauty` is 2**
