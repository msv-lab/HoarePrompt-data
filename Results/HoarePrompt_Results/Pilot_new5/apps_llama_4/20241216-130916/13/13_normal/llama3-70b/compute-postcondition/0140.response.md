Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 4, otherwise `beauty` is 3 if we are still in the loop, or 2 and we break out of the most internal loop if the character at index `j` is not 'G' and we are not in the if part.**
