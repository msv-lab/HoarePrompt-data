Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and `beauty`, `i` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` equals `n` or the index of the first 'S' encountered after `i + 1`, and `beauty` is the initial value of `beauty` plus the number of 'G' characters between `i + 2` and the first 'S' encountered after `i + 1` (inclusive if 'S' is at `i + 2`, exclusive if 'S' is after `i + 2`), or all 'G' characters after `i + 1` if no 'S' is encountered, otherwise `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0***
