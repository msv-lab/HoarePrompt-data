The code increments the `left` variable by 1. The initial state of `left` is 0, so the new value of `left` will be 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters and s[1] is 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is at least 1**
