To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```
From the output states for the first few iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

* `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
* `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
* `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
* `max_beauty` remains the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`.
* `curr_beauty` remains either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`.
* `left` remains at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character.
* `right` remains equal to `n`.
* `max_beauty_one_swap` remains the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1.
* `i` remains greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`.
* `s[i]` remains 'G'.
* `s[i + 1]` remains 'S'.
* `j` increments by 1 in each iteration, starting from `i + 2`.
* `beauty` increments by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise, the loop breaks.

After all iterations have finished, the loop will have checked all characters in the string `s` from index `i + 2` to `n - 1`. If all characters in this range are 'G', then `beauty` will be the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the end of the string. If any character in this range is 'S', then the loop will break, and `beauty` will be the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is less than or equal to `i + 1`), then `beauty` will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1, `i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `n`, and `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i + 2` towards the end of `s`, or the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the end of `s` if no 'S' character is found.**
