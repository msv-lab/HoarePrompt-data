Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is the last index plus one of `s`. If `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is 1 and `max_beauty` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` remain unchanged, with `left` being equal to `right` if no 'G' is found or the end of `s` is reached.***
