To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `j` equals `i - 2`. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decremented by 1, so the new value of `j` would be `i - 3`.

The other states do not depend on the loop variable `j`, so they remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1, `i` is greater than 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` equals `i - 3`**
