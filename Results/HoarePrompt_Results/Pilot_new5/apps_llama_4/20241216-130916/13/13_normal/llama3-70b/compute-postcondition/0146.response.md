The given code is a `break` statement. This statement will terminate the loop that it is currently inside. 

The variables `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, `j`, and `beauty` are not modified by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `i - 1` and moving backwards, or 1 if the loop did not execute, the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S', and we break out of the most internal loop.**
