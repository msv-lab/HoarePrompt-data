To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop iterates over the string `s` from index 0 to `n-2` (since the range is `n-1`), and for each pair of characters where the current character is 'G' and the next character is 'S', it calculates a beauty score. This beauty score is the count of 'G' characters to the left of the current 'G' (up to the first 'S' encountered when moving left, or all 'G' characters if no 'S' is found), plus 1 for the current 'G', plus the count of 'G' characters to the right of the next 'S' (up to the first 'S' encountered when moving right, or all 'G' characters if no 'S' is found).

Given this, the `max_beauty_one_swap` variable will keep track of the maximum beauty score found during these iterations. If no 'G' followed by 'S' is found, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0.

Considering the loop will execute `n-1` times (from `i=0` to `i=n-2`), and based on the provided output states for the first few iterations, we can infer the final output state.

- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), as it's a condition for the loop's setup and doesn't change within the loop.
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, as it doesn't change within the loop.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, which doesn't change within the loop.
- `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` are related to the maximum beauty and current beauty, respectively, but their direct updates are not shown within the provided loop code. Thus, their final values depend on updates not shown in the provided loop, but based on the initial state, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`.
- `left` and `right` are mentioned in the output states but not updated within the provided loop code, so their final values remain as initially stated or updated elsewhere in the code not shown.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` will be the maximum beauty score found across all iterations where a 'G' is followed by an 'S', or 0 if no such pair is found.

Given these observations, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty score of 'G' characters that can be achieved by swapping one 'G' with an 'S' in `s`, or 0 if no 'G' is followed by 'S', and other variables (`max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `right`) retain their values as per their last updates before or within the loop, with `i` being `n-1` after the loop completes.**
