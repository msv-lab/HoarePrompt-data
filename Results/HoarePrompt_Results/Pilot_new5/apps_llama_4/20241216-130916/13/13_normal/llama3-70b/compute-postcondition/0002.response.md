The code creates a list `golden` that stores the indices of all 'G' characters in the input string `s`. The list comprehension iterates over the string `s` using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index `i` and the character `x` at each position. The `if` condition filters out characters that are not 'G', so only the indices of 'G' characters are included in the `golden` list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of all 'G' characters in `s`.**
