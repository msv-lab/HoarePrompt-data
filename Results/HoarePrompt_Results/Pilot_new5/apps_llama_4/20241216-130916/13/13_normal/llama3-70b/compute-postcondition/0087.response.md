Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i + 2`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`, `i` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `i + 4`, if `s[j]` equals 'G', then `beauty` equals the initial `beauty` + 1, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop.**
