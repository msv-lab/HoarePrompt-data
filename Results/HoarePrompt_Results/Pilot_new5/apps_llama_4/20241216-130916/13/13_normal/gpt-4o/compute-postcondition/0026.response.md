Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', and if the character at index 0 in `trophies` is 'G', then `i` must be less than `n` (implying not all characters in `trophies` are 'G'), otherwise `i` is 1 and the character at index 0 in `trophies` is 'S`. Additionally, the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S'**
