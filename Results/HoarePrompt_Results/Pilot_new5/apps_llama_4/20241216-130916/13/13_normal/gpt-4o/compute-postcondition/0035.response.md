To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop statement: `while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':`.

1. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`.
2. Additionally, the character at the `i-th` index of `trophies` must be 'G'.

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `trophies[i-2]` must be 'G'.
- `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `start` is equal to `i - 2`.
- If `i` is less than `n`, `trophies[i-1]` must be 'G' and `trophies[i]` can be 'G' or 'S'.

From the given conditions, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be less than `n`, not less than or equal to `n`, because the loop condition requires `i < n`.
- `trophies[i]` must be 'G' for the loop to continue, as the condition `trophies[i] == 'G'` must be true.

Considering these adjustments:
- `n` being greater than or equal to 2 is not sufficient; `n` must be greater than `i` to ensure `i < n`.
- `trophies[i-2]` being 'G' is a given condition but does not directly affect the next iteration's condition.
- `i` being less than or equal to `n` needs to be adjusted to `i` being strictly less than `n`.
- The condition on `start` (`start` is equal to `i - 2`) is not directly relevant to the loop's continuation condition.
- The condition that if `i` is less than `n`, `trophies[i-1]` must be 'G' and `trophies[i]` can be 'G' or 'S', needs adjustment so that `trophies[i]` must be 'G'.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` must be greater than `i`.
- `trophies[i]` must be 'G'.

State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `trophies[i-2]` must be 'G', `i` is less than `n`, `start` is equal to `i - 2`, and `trophies[i]` must be 'G'**
