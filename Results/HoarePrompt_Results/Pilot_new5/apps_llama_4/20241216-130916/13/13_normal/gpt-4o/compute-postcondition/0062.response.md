The value of `prev_start` and `prev_end` is reassigned to the start and end of the sequence of 'G's at index `i - 1` in `segments`. The value of `i` is 3, so `prev_start` and `prev_end` are reassigned to the start and end of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`. 

Since `prev_start` is the start of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments` and `prev_end` is the end of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments` in the initial state, the new `prev_start` is actually the start of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments` and the new `prev_end` is the end of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`. 

However, we have `i` equals 3 and we have `segments[i - 1]`, so we now have `prev_start` equals `segments[3-1][0]` and `prev_end` equals `segments[3-1][1]` which is actually `segments[2][0]` and `segments[2][1]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has at least 4 elements, `trophies` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is the start of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`, which is actually `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is the end of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`, which is `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` is the start of the sequence of 'G's at index 3 in `segments`, `curr_end` is the end of the sequence of 'G's at index 3 in `segments`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has at least 4 elements, `trophies` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` is the start of the sequence of 'G's at index 3 in `segments`, `curr_end` is the end of the sequence of 'G's at index 3 in `segments`**
