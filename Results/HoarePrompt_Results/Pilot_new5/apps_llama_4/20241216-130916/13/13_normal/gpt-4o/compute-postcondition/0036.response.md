The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was less than `n`, and `n` is greater than `i`, so the new value of `i` is still less than or equal to `n`. The value of `start` was `i - 2`, so it is still `i - 3` after the increment. The string `trophies` and its properties remain unchanged, as do the conditions that `trophies[i-2]` must be 'G' and `trophies[i]` must be 'G', but now these conditions apply to the new value of `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `trophies[i-3]` must be 'G', `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `start` is equal to `i - 3`, and `trophies[i-1]` must be 'G'**
