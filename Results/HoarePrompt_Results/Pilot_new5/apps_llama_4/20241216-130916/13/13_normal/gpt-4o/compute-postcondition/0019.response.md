The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was less than `n` and `trophies[i]` was 'G', so now `i` is less than or equal to `n` and its relationship with `trophies` and the other variables has changed, but `n`, `trophies`, and `start` remain the same. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S' with at least one 'G' at the index where `start` is, `i` is `start` + 1 and is less than or equal to `n`, and `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`.**
