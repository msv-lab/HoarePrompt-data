The value of `start` is assigned the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is less than `n`, and `start` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is less than `n`, and `start` is equal to `i`**
