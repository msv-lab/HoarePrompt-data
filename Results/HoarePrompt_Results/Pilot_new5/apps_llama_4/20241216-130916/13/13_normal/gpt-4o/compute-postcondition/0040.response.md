The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was less than `n`, so the new value of `i` is less than or equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is less than or equal to `n`**
