Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` is intended to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. However, it does not trim any whitespace from the strings before sorting. This can lead to unexpected sorting results, as leading or trailing spaces can affect the order of strings.

For example, consider the input:
```python
([' apple', 'banana'], ['orange ', 'grape'])
```
The expected output should be:
```python
[[' apple', 'banana'], ['grape', 'orange ']]
```
However, using the current implementation, the output would be:
```python
[[' apple', 'banana'], [' orange', 'grape']]
```
because ' orange' (with a leading space) is considered less than 'grape'.

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description in handling strings with leading or trailing whitespace properly, making it incorrect.
