#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list of lists, where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner, based on the strings contained within the original list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings, and returns a new list of lists with each sublist sorted in a case-insensitive manner. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-string elements, but it will still process them without error. If empty sublists are present, they will remain empty in the output.
