#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list of lists, where each sublist from 'list_of_lists' is sorted alphabetically.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists containing strings and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted alphabetically. The function does not handle cases where the input might not be a list of lists, which could lead to a TypeError if any sublist is not sortable.
