Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` is designed to accept a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), where each sublist contains strings. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Sorting Mechanism**: The program uses `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` to sort each sublist in a case-insensitive manner. This meets the requirement of sorting each sublist of strings, as specified in the problem.

3. **Output Structure**: The function returns a new list containing sorted sublists, maintaining the nested list structure required in the problem description.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although the program does not explicitly handle empty lists or non-string elements, it still processes them without error:
   - If the input is an empty list, the output will be an empty list, which is consistent with the expected behavior.
   - If a sublist contains non-string elements, they will still be processed by the `sorted` function, but it’s important to note that the problem description does not specify handling non-string elements. Thus, this is not a violation of the requirements.

5. **Empty Sublists**: The handling of empty sublists is also appropriate. The sorted version of an empty sublist is still an empty sublist, consistent with the output requirement.

Overall, the program effectively sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, adhering to the requirements specified in the problem description. Hence, it is correct.
