The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to sort each sublist of strings within a list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension that calls the `sorted()` function on each sublist, effectively sorting the strings alphabetically.

Let's analyze:

1. **Problem Description**: The function is supposed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. 

2. **Code Analysis**: The code does indeed sort each sublist using the `sorted()` function, which works as expected for lists of strings. 

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If any of the sublists are not lists themselves (e.g., if one of the "sublists" is an integer), this will raise a `TypeError` since you cannot sort a non-list type.
   - If any of the sublists contain non-string types (e.g., integers or None), this too will cause a `TypeError` when trying to sort them, since the `sorted()` function expects comparable items.

4. **Output Hints**: The output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the input might not be a list of lists, which is a valid concern. If a sublist is not sortable, it would lead to a runtime error, contradicting the requirement that the function should gracefully handle all cases.

The output hints point out a significant flaw in the implementation: it does not account for the possibility of invalid types in the input, which can lead to exceptions. 

Given this analysis, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to the lack of handling for non-list or non-string types. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for edge cases where sublists may not be valid lists or may contain types that cannot be sorted, leading to potential runtime errors.
