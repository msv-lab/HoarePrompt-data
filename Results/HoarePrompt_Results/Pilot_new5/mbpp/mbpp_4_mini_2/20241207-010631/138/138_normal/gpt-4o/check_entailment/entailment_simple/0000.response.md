Correctness: **False**

The given program `func_1` does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Return Format**: The problem description requires the function to return a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element. While the program does return a tuple, it returns `(True, index)` when the element is found and `(False, -1)` when it is not found. However, the index position of the element is completely missing from the return when the element is found. 

   The correct return when the element is found should be `(True, index)`; however, if the element is not found, the return should correctly indicate `False` and `-1`.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Index**: The program's handling of returning the index of the element is also misleading as it does not account for scenarios where the element is not found correctly. It does return `-1` when the element is not present, but it fails to encapsulate the case where it should also return the index (which, if the element is not found, logically cannot be provided).

3. **Incorrect Handling of Data Types**: The function does not explicitly handle the case where the input list is empty, though the problem description implies it should return `False` and `-1`. However, it does return `False` and `-1` correctly for an empty list, but this might not be apparent in its design.

To conclude, the program does not fully comply with the problem description requirements, particularly in the expected outputs when an element is found in the list. The missing part is the handling of returning the index in all cases accurately, which leads to the conclusion that it does not meet the requirements.
