The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`. It searches for the first occurrence of the `element` in the list and returns `True` along with its index if found. If the `element` is not found in the list, it returns `False` and -1. The function does not limit the search to the first three positions as stated in the annotations; it checks the entire list. If the list `arr` is empty, it directly returns `False` and -1.
