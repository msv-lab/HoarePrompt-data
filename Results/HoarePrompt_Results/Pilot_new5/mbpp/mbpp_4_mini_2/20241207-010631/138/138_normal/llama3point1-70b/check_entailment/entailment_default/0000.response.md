The provided program aims to find an element in an array and return a tuple that indicates whether the element is present and its index, or -1 if it is not found. 

The program uses the `index` method to find the index of the element, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not present. The code captures this exception and returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`.

Looking at the problem description:
- The function should return a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
- This describes the behavior of the code accurately.

Now, checking for edge cases:
1. The function handles the case where the element is not found in the array by using a try-except block.
2. It should also handle cases where the array is empty. If we call `func_1([], 'a')`, it should return `(False, -1)`, which it does.
3. The function will return `(True, 0)` for the case when the element is the first item in the list (e.g., `func_1(['a'], 'a')`).

Next, we look at the output hints:
- The output hints state that the function accepts a list and a value, and correctly describes the behavior of the function for both finding and not finding the element.
- They confirm the handling of the `ValueError` case and that it returns the expected output tuple.

Given that the function implementation correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints align with the codeâ€™s functionality, I conclude that it works as intended.

Correctness: **True**.
