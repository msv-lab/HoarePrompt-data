The variable `index` is assigned the value of the index of `element` in the `array`. The `array` is a list of elements, and `element` may or may not be present in that list. If `element` is found, `index` will contain the corresponding index. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, `element` is a value that may be present in the `array`, and `index` is the index of `element` in `array`, if found.**
