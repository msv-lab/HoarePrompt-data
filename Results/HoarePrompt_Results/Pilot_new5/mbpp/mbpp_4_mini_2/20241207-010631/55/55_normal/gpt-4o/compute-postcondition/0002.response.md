The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `snake_str`. `snake_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores and contains at least one underscore. After executing the function body, it returns a string formed by joining the capitalized components of `snake_str` after splitting it at each underscore. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `snake_str` and return a new string that is the result of capitalizing each segment of `snake_str` split by underscores and joining them together without any spaces. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter snake_str, which is a string containing lowercase letters and underscores, and returns a string formed by joining the capitalized segments of snake_str split by underscores.**
