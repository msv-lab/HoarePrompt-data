Correctness: **True**.

The provided program accurately calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:
1. It correctly imports the `math` module to access the value of \( \pi \).
2. The formula used in the function `func_1(radius, height)` matches the standard mathematical formula for the volume of a cone.
3. It correctly returns the computed volume.

The function will work correctly for all positive values of `radius` and `height`, including edge cases such as:
- When both `radius` and `height` are 0, it will return 0, which is appropriate as the volume of a cone with no dimensions should be 0.
- If either `radius` or `height` is negative, it will still compute a volume, but semantically this doesn't make sense in the context of a physical cone. However, the problem description does not specify constraints on the input, so the function operates without errors.

Therefore, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
