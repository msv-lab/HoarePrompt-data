Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone, which is given by \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The assertions provided in the program test this function with various inputs, and they check if the output is close to the expected volume values within a relative tolerance, which demonstrates that it handles these cases accurately. 

Since I could not find any potential case where the function does not work as expected, the program meets the problem requirements for calculating the volume of a cone.
