Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone. 

Here’s why the program consistently meets the problem description:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are stated to be non-negative real numbers. This aligns with the mathematical requirements for calculating the volume of a cone, as negative or non-real values for radius and height would not make sense in this context.

2. **Volume Calculation**: The formula used in the function is exactly the correct mathematical formula for calculating the volume of a cone: \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The implementation uses Python's `math.pi` for an accurate value of π, ensuring precision in the calculation.

3. **Output**: The function returns the calculated volume, which is the expected output based on the problem description.

Therefore, since the function correctly performs the task of calculating the volume of a cone according to the provided description, the correctness is affirmed as **True**.
