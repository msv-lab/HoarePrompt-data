The function accepts two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of a cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius² * height. It does not handle negative values for `radius` or `height`, which would lead to incorrect calculations or unexpected results. Additionally, if either `radius` or `height` is zero, the volume will be zero, but the function still returns a valid numerical result.
