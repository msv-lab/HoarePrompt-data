Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

Where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone,
- \( h \) is the height of the cone.

The function `func_1` takes two parameters (`radius` and `height`) and computes the volume using this formula. 

Testing with various inputs:
1. For a cone with `radius = 3` and `height = 5`, the volume would be:

   \[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3^2)(5) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (9)(5) = 15 \pi \]

   This would return approximately 47.1239.

2. For a cone with `radius = 0` or `height = 0`, the volume would correctly return 0 since any cone with zero dimensions has zero volume.

3. Negative values for `radius` or `height` may not make practical sense in the physical world, but mathematically the formula will still calculate a value. For example, a cone with `radius = -3` and `height = 5` would return a negative volume:

   \[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (-3^2)(5) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (9)(5) = 15 \pi \]

   However, this case is outside the expected domain for physical cones, but the function handles it mathematically.

Overall, the program correctly adheres to the problem description without missing any logic or edge cases that would change the expected outcomes. Thus, it returns the correct volume for all potential cases I could consider.
