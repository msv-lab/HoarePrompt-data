Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and checks if all the elements within it are of the same type. It returns `True` if the tuple is empty or if all elements are of the same type; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where the tuple contains elements of different types adequately, as it only checks the first element's type against all others without any additional conditions for tuples of length 1 or empty tuples. **
