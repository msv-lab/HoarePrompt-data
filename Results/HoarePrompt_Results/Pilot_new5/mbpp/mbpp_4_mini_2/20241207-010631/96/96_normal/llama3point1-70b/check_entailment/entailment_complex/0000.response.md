Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input tuple `tup` is empty. According to the problem description, the function must check if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. If the tuple is empty, the program will return `True`, which is logically inconsistent with the requirement to check for uniformity of types among the elements. An empty tuple does not have elements to compare, so it should not automatically return `True`. 

For a correct implementation, the function should explicitly handle the empty tuple case by returning `False`, as there are no types to compare in an empty tuple. Thus, the behavior of the function for the edge case of an empty tuple does not align with the problem description.
