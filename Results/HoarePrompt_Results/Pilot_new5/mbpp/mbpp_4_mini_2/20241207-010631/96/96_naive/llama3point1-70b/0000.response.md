Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type by converting the types of each element into a set and then checking if the length of that set is 1. 

This logic works correctly for various cases:
1. For a tuple with elements of the same data type (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`), the output will be `True`.
2. For a tuple with elements of different data types (e.g., `(1, '2', 3.0)`), the output will be `False`.
3. It handles empty tuples as well, returning `True` since an empty set has a length of 0, and thus does not contradict the requirement.

There are no edge cases that would cause the function to return an incorrect result based on the problem description, confirming the implementation's correctness.
