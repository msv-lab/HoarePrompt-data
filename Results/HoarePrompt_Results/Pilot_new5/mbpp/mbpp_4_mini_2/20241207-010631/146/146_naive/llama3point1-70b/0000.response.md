Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists but does not handle the case where the input list of lists is empty. If `list_of_lists` is empty, calling `max()` on an empty iterable will raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not account for this potential edge case. 

For example, if the input is `func_1([])`, the program will throw an error instead of returning a valid output.
