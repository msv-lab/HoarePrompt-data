Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description carefully.

**Problem description**: The function should find the longest list in a list of lists and return a tuple containing the length of that longest list and the longest list itself. If the input list is empty, it should return 0 and an empty list.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
    return (max_len, max_list)
```

**Initial Analysis**:
1. The program initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list.
2. It iterates over each list (`lst`) in `list_of_lists`.
3. If the length of the current list (`lst`) is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and `max_list`.
4. Finally, it returns a tuple `(max_len, max_list)`.

**Edge Cases to Consider**:
- **Empty List**: If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function does not currently handle this, since it would return `(0, [])` by default, which aligns with the expected behavior. However, it needs to be explicitly checked in the implementation for clarity.
- **Multiple Lists with the Same Maximum Length**: If there is more than one list with the maximum length, the program will return the last one it encounters, which is acceptable as per the problem description.
- **Lists with Zero Length**: If there are lists that are empty within the input, the logic will still correctly identify the longest non-empty list.

**Output Hints**: The hints indicate that the function returns a tuple containing the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself, which agrees with the program's implementation. They also correctly mention that if the input list is empty, it should return `(0, [])`.

**Conclusion**: After considering the problem description, program logic, and output hints, the following points affirm the correctness of the code:
- The program correctly identifies the longest list and its length.
- It handles the empty list case as required by returning `(0, [])`.
- The program's logic aligns with the problem description under all expected circumstances.

Correctness: **True**.
