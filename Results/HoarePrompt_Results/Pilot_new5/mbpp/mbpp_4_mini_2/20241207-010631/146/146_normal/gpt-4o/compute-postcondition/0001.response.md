The variable `max_list` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of `list_of_lists` and `max_len` remain unchanged, as the assignment of `max_list` does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `list_of_lists` and `max_len`, along with the new empty state of `max_list`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list.**
