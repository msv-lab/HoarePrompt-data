#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can contain elements of any type.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns the maximum length of the sublists in 'list_of_lists' (max_len) and the first sublist from 'max_sublists' which contains sublists of that maximum length.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of sublists and returns the maximum length of those sublists and the first sublist that has that maximum length. If `list_of_lists` is empty, a `ValueError` will occur when trying to compute the maximum length, which the function does not handle. Therefore, the function will raise an error in that case.
