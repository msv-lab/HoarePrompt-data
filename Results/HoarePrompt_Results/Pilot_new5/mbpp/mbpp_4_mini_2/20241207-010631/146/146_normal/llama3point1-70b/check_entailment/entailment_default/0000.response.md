The provided program is designed to find the maximum length of sublists within a list of lists and return that maximum length along with the first sublist that has that maximum length. 

Initially assessing the code based on the problem description, it does appear to meet the requirement of returning the maximum length of the sublists and the first sublist of that maximum length. However, it does not handle the case where the `list_of_lists` is empty. If an empty list is passed, the `max()` function will raise a `ValueError`, which means that the function would not work correctly for this edge case.

Now, examining the output hints: they state that if `list_of_lists` is empty, a `ValueError` will occur when trying to compute the maximum length, which the function does not handle. This aligns with the assessment that the function does not handle all potential cases as outlined in the problem description.

Given these points, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to handle the scenario where the input list is empty.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function would raise a `ValueError` if provided with an empty list, which means it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all cases.
