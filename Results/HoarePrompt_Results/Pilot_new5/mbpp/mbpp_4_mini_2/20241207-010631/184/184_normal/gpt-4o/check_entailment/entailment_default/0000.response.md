The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to filter out odd numbers from a list of integers. The code uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list `nums`. 

Looking at the problem description, the function is supposed to return a new list that includes all the odd integers from `nums`, and if `nums` is empty or has no odd integers, it should return an empty list. 

Examining the code:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
```
This implementation correctly filters odd numbers. It iterates over each number in the list and includes it in the result list if it satisfies the condition `num % 2 != 0` (which is true for odd numbers).

Now, let's analyze the output hints provided:
- The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing all the odd integers from `nums`. 
- If `nums` is empty or contains no odd integers, the function will return an empty list.

The output hints align with the code's functionality. They confirm that the function behaves as intended, including returning an empty list when there are no odd integers or if the input list is empty.

Considering edge cases:
1. An empty list `[]` should return `[]`.
2. A list with no odd numbers, e.g., `[2, 4, 6]`, should return `[]`.
3. A list that contains only odd numbers, e.g., `[1, 3, 5]`, should return `[1, 3, 5]`.
4. A mixed list with both odd and even numbers, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, should return `[1, 3]`.

After reviewing all cases and ensuring that their outputs would be as expected based on the description and code, I find no discrepancies.

Given all the checks and confirmations, I can conclude that the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**.
