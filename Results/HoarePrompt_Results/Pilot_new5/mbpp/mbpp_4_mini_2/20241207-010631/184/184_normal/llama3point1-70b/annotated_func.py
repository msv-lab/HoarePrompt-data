#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of all odd integers from the list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing all integers from `nums` that are odd. It does not handle any specific cases for empty lists or non-integer values, but it will simply return an empty list if `nums` is empty or if there are no odd integers.
