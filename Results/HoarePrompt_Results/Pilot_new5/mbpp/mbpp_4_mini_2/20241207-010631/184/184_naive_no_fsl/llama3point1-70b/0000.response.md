Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to filter odd numbers, but it fails to correctly handle the case of an empty list. According to the problem description, the function should return a filtered list containing only odd numbers. However, in the case of an empty input, the program will return an empty list, which is technically correct but does not fulfill any specific filtering requirement that may be implied by the problem description (e.g., returning a message or handling inputs differently).

Additionally, there is no handling for non-integer inputs, which could lead to a TypeError when the modulus operation is attempted on non-integer types. For example, if `func_1([1, 2, 'three'])` is called, it will raise an error instead of properly filtering out the odd numbers.

Therefore, due to the lack of explicit handling for these cases, the correctness of the program is marked as **False**.
