To determine the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1`, we need to analyze the function according to the problem description, which states that the function should multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the product by the length of that list.

Here's the breakdown of what the function does:

1. It initializes a variable `product` to 1.
2. It iterates through each number in the input `numbers`, multiplying them together.
3. It divides the final product by the length of the input list.
4. It returns the result.

Now let's consider some potential edge cases:

1. An empty list: If `func_1` is called with an empty list (i.e., `func_1([])`), this will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because the length of the list is zero, and we cannot divide by zero.

2. A list with one number: When the list has one number (e.g., `func_1([5])`), the function should return that number divided by one, which is correct. However, it's worth noting that this case needs to be explicitly tested.

3. A list containing zero: If the input list contains a zero (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 0])`), the product will be zero, and the function will return 0 divided by the length of the list, which is also valid behavior.

4. A list with negative numbers: The function seems to handle negative numbers correctly, as it will multiply them correctly and return the result divided by the length.

Given the above analysis, the function does not handle the case of an empty list correctly, which means it does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False** 

The function fails when called with an empty list (e.g., `func_1([])`), raising a `ZeroDivisionError`.
