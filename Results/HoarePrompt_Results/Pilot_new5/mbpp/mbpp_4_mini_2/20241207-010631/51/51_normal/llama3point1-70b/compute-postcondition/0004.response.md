`product` is assigned the value of `product` multiplied by `num`. Since `product` is initially equal to `num`, this results in `product` becoming `num * num`, or `num**2`. The value of `num` is the second element of `numbers`, which is still valid after the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects this calculation and retains the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `product` is equal to `num**2`**.
