The `product` is assigned the value of `product *= num`, which means the current value of `product` (which is 1) is multiplied by `num` (the first element of the `numbers` list). The value of `num` is specific as it is the first element of `numbers`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `numbers`, `product` is equal to `num`.**
