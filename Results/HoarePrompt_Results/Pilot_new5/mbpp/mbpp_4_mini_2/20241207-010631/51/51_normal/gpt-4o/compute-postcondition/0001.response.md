According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list. Since the list is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `product` is initialized to 1. This does not affect the execution of the loop but indicates the initial state for the computation inside the loop. Additionally, during the first iteration, the variable `num` will hold the first element of the `numbers` list.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to acknowledge that `num` will be the first number in the list during the first iteration. 

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that is not empty, `product` is 1, `num` is the first element in the numbers list**
