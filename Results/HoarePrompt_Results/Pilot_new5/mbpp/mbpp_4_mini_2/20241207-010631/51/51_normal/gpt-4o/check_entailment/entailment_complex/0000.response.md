The function `func_1` is supposed to multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide by the length of that list, as outlined in the problem description. 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Product Calculation**: The function initializes `product` to 1 and iterates through each number in the input list `numbers`, multiplying each number to `product`. This correctly computes the product of all the numbers in the list.

2. **Division by Length**: After calculating the product, the function divides this product by the length of the list using `len(numbers)`. This effectively computes the average of the numbers in the list by treating the product as a "total" and dividing by the number of elements.

3. **Handling Zero**: A notable issue arises if any number in the list is zero: this will result in a product of zero, and hence the returned average will also be zero. This does not align with the problem description, which does not specify that the average can be zero when zero is present in the list, as that would not represent an average of the non-zero numbers in the list.

4. **Single Element List**: If the list contains only one number, the average returned will be that number itself, which is correct.

5. **Non-numeric Types**: The function is currently not designed to handle non-numeric types as per the problem description, though it states that it assumes `numbers` is a list of integers or floats. However, this assumption could lead to runtime errors if the function ever receives a list containing non-numeric data.

### Conclusion:
While the function correctly computes the product and divides by the length, the fact that the product can be zero (and hence the output can be misleading) when zero is present in the list means that it does not strictly satisfy the problem description. There is also a lack of error handling for non-numeric types.

Correctness: **False**
