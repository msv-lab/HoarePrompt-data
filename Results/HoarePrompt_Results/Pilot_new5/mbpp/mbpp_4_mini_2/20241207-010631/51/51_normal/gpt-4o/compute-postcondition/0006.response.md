The variable `product` is multiplied by `num`, where `num` is equal to the third element in the `numbers` list. Since `product` was initially equal to the square of the third element, after the operation, `product` will be equal to the cube of the third element in the `numbers` list. The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 3 elements; `product` is equal to the cube of the third element in the list; `num` is equal to the third element in the `numbers` list.**
