According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list, and `product` is equal to `num`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `num` should now represent the third element in the list, and for that, the list must have at least 3 elements. 

State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, `product` is equal to `num**
