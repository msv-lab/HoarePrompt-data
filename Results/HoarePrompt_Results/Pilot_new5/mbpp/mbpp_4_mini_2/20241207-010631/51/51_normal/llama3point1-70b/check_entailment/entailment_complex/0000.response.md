Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and divides by the length of the list. However, the function instead calculates the average of the numbers incorrectly by multiplying them and then dividing by the length, which is not the correct formula for an average. 

In particular, the program comments state that it will return "the average of the numbers in the list," but it actually performs a product operation instead of a sum operation, which is not what an average is. Additionally, if the list contains a zero, the final product will be zero, which is not a valid representation of an average in the context of the provided problem.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, as it does not return the correct average; it returns a value based on multiplication instead.
