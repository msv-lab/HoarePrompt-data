Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides that product by the length of the list. However, the comment in the code erroneously claims that the program returns the average of the numbers in the list, which is incorrect.

The program computes the product of all numbers in the list and divides it by the length of the list, which is not the average of the numbers. The average is calculated by summing the numbers and dividing by the length, not by multiplying them.

For example, given the list `[2, 4]`, the expected average would be `(2 + 4) / 2 = 3`, but the program would compute `product = 2 * 4 = 8` and then `8 / 2 = 4`, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Hence, the program does not adhere to the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
