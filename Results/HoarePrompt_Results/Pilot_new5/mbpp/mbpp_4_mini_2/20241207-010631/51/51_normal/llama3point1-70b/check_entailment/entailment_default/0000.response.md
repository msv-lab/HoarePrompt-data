The function description asks for a function that multiplies all numbers in a list and divides that product by the length of the list. Initially, it seems that the code does follow the problem description as it multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list.

However, the approach used to calculate an "average" is flawed. The average should be calculated by summing the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers, not by multiplying them. Since the code multiplies the numbers instead of summing them, it does not correctly implement the requirement to compute an average. 

Now, let's consider the edge cases:
1. If the list is empty, this would lead to a division by zero error when trying to calculate `len(numbers)`.
2. If the list contains any zeros, the product will be zero, leading to a result of zero, which does not represent an average of any numbers in the list.

Now, looking at the output hints, they mention that the function incorrectly calculates an average because it multiplies all elements instead of summing them. This further reinforces that the implementation does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description. 

Given these considerations, we can conclude that the function does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program is incorrect because it calculates the product of the numbers in the list rather than the sum, which does not align with the definition of an average. Additionally, it risks division by zero if the list is empty and returns zero if any number in the list is zero, which may not represent a valid average.
