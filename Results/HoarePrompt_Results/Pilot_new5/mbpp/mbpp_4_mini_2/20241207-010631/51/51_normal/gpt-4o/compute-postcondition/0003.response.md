According to the code, the loop iterates over the `numbers` list. Since the list is not empty, it can execute for each element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the first element in the `numbers` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next element in the `numbers` list, and the product will be updated accordingly. 

If `numbers` has at least 2 elements, then `num` will be the second element in the list for the next iteration. 

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 2 elements, `product` is equal to the second element in the list, `num` is the second element in the numbers list**
