The variable `product` is initialized to the value of 1. The state of `numbers` is not affected, as it is simply a pre-existing list. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats) with at least one element; `product` is 1.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats) with at least one element; `product` is 1**.
