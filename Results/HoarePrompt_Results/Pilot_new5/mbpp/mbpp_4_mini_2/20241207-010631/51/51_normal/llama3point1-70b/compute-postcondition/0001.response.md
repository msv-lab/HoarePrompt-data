According to the code, the loop iterates over the `numbers` list. Since it is specified that `numbers` is a list with at least one element, the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `product` is 1. 

For the loop to be executed properly:
- The `num` variable will take on the value of the first element in `numbers` during the first iteration.
- The `product` variable is initialized to 1.

Thus, the states that need to be stated are:
- `num` is the first element of `numbers`.
- `product` is 1 (as given).

State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `numbers`, `product` is 1**
