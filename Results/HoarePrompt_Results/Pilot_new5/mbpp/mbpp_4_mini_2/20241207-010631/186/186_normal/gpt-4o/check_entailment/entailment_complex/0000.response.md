The program provided does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to extract "elementwise and" tuples from the given two tuples. However, the implementation in the program performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples, which is not the same as extracting element-wise tuples. 

The key issues are:

1. The term "elementwise and" in the problem description is ambiguous and could be interpreted as simply pairing the elements from both tuples into a new tuple. However, the function instead computes the bitwise AND, which is a specific binary operation that may not align with the intended interpretation of the problem.

2. The returns of the function do not match any standard tuple extraction method; they result in a new tuple containing the results of the bitwise AND, which is not what would be expected from a function designed to "extract" tuples.

For example, if the tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)` are given, their corresponding bitwise AND results in `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is not simply extracting or pairing the tuples. In essence, the results don't fulfill the expected output described in the problem statement.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
