Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The description states that the function should "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." However, the provided implementation performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. 

The term "extract the elementwise and tuples" is ambiguous, but it implies that the function should likely return the tuples themselves or possibly the elements in some form of combination. The implementation, on the other hand, is specifically applying a bitwise operation, which does not align with the description's request.

For instance, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`, the program would return `(0, 0, 2)` due to the bitwise AND operation, which does not reflect a simple extraction or combination of the tuples themselves. 

Thus, the program does not correctly follow the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
