To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code:

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Problem Description:
The task is to "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples."

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`.
2. It uses `zip` to pair corresponding elements of the two tuples.
3. For each pair `(x, y)` from `zip(tup1, tup2)`, it calculates `x & y`, which is the bitwise AND operation. 
4. The result of these operations is collected in a tuple and returned.

### Potential Issues:
1. The problem description is vague. It says "extract the elementwise and tuples," which can imply that the function should handle tuples of various types (like integers, strings, etc.).
2. The bitwise AND operation (`&`) is only defined for integer types. If either `tup1` or `tup2` contains non-integer elements (like strings or floats), the program will raise a `TypeError`.
3. The function does not handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths: if `tup1` has a different number of elements than `tup2`, the `zip` function will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple, potentially leading to loss of data from the longer tuple.

### Example of Failure:
- If we call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))`, the result would be `(0, 0)` since it would only compute the AND for the first two elements, ignoring `3` from `tup1`.
- If we call `func_1((1, 'a'), (4, 5))`, it would raise an error due to the presence of a string.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle tuples of different lengths and does not account for non-integer types, the implementation will fail for various valid inputs according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
