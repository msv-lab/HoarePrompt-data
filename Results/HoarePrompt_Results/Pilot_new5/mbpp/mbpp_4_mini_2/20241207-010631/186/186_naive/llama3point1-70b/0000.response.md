To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that extracts elementwise tuples from two given tuples. This suggests that for each corresponding element in the two input tuples, we should produce a new tuple where each element is obtained through some operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples.

### Program Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

#### Breakdown of the Code:
1. The function takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`.
2. It uses `zip` to pair elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.
3. For each pair `(x, y)`, it computes `x & y` (the bitwise AND operation).
4. The result is collected into a new tuple and returned.

### Potential Issues
- The problem description does not specify that a bitwise AND operation should be performed. It simply states to "extract the elementwise and tuples." This term is ambiguous and could imply various operations (such as addition, subtraction, etc.) or even just pairing the elements without an operation.
- The function will only work correctly for tuples containing integers (or compatible types for the `&` operator). If the tuples contain non-integer types (e.g., strings, floats), it will raise a `TypeError`.
- Additionally, if the tuples have different lengths, the function will simply truncate the longer tuple to match the length of the shorter one without any warning or notice.

### Example Cases
1. **Different Length Tuples**: 
   - Input: `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`
   - Output: `(1 & 3, 2 & 4)` â†’ `(1, 0)` (truncated).
   
2. **Non-integer Elements**:
   - Input: `func_1(('a', 'b'), ('c', 'd'))`
   - Output: This would raise a TypeError since `&` cannot be applied to strings.

Given these observations, the program does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**. 

The program is incorrect because:
- It uses a specific operation (bitwise AND) which is not mentioned in the problem description.
- It does not handle tuples of different lengths appropriately.
- It does not manage cases where the elements are not compatible with the AND operation, leading to potential errors.
