According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate from `n` down to `1`, which means `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute. Additionally, the variable `size` will take on the values starting from `n` during the first iteration. 

Given that `arr` is a list, `n` should be equal to the length of `arr`, and it must be greater than `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following conditions must be satisfied: `n` must be greater than `0`, and during the first iteration, `size` will be equal to `n`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` must be greater than 0, and `size` is now `n`**
