Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements of any type with length `n` greater than 2, `curr_size` is 2, and `max_index` is returned from `find_max_index(2)`. If `max_index` is not equal to `curr_size - 1`, the element at index `max_index` in `arr` has been flipped. If `max_index` is equal to `curr_size - 1`, no changes occur to the list.***
