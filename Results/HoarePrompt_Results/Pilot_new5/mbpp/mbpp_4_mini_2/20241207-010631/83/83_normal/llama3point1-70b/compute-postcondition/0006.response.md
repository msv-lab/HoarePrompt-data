Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is now `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, then the elements in `arr` from the start up to `max_index` are reversed. The value of `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` and not equal to 0.***
