You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of elements of any type, `n` is the length of `arr` which is greater than 1. The loop ensures that the maximum elements are moved to their correct positions in descending order for all elements in `arr`.
    return arr
    #The program returns the sorted list 'arr' in descending order, which contains elements of any type and has a length greater than 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer that represents the index of the last element in the list arr, and start is implicitly initialized to 0 which is less than or equal to end.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to the original value of `end` plus 1, `end` is less than or equal to the original value of `end` but has been decremented to -1, `arr` has been modified such that the elements between the original indices `0` to `end` have been swapped with their corresponding elements from `end` to `0` (inclusive).

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the list arr, and arr is a list of comparable elements.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr`, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, and if `n` is 1, `max_index` is 0.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum value in 'arr', which is 'max_index'


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
