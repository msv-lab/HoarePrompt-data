The provided function `func_1` attempts to sort a list of elements using a selection sort-like approach. The function modifies the input list in place and is expected to return the sorted list.

Initial assessment of the code:
1. The outer loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, indicating an attempt to sort the list by finding the maximum element in the unsorted portion and moving it to its correct position.
2. The use of `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the maximum element within the current unsorted portion of the list.
3. The elements up to `max_index` are reversed first, followed by reversing the entire unsorted portion (up to `size`).

Potential edge cases:
- If the input list is empty, the function should handle it gracefully and return an empty list.
- If the list contains duplicate elements, the sorting mechanism may not preserve the original order of those duplicate elements, which is critical for stability in sorting. However, the problem description does not specify that stability is required.
- The function could also fail with a list containing non-comparable elements (e.g., a list of mixed types) since it assumes all elements in the list can be compared.

Now, let's check the output hints:
- The function is stated to accept a list of comparable elements and sort them in ascending order. This aligns with the function's logic.
- However, if we consider the edge case of an empty list or mixed-type list (which is not explicitly mentioned in the hints), the function may not behave as expected.

Overall, since:
- The function does not explicitly handle an empty list.
- It may not handle mixed types correctly.
- It is not stable, and while stability is not mentioned in the problem description, it can affect certain use cases.

The output hints do not contradict the code but do not cover all edge cases (like non-comparable elements or empty lists) either.

Correctness: **False**. 
The function does not handle empty lists, which could lead to unhandled exceptions. Hence, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
