The value of `n` is assigned the length of the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, the value of `n` will be a non-negative integer representing the number of elements in `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other; `n` is the length of `arr`.**
