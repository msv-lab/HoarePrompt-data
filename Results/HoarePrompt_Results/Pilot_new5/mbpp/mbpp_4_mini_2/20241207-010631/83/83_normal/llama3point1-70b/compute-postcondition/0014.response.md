Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, the first `n - 1` elements of `arr` are reversed, while maintaining `n` greater than 0, `size` as `n - 1`, and `max_index` as the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.***
