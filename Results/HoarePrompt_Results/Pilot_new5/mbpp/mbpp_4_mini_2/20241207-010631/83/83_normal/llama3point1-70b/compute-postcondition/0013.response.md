The code modifies the list `arr` by reversing the first `size` elements of it, which is defined as `n - 1`. The value of `max_index` determines whether the reversal operation occurs or not. If `max_index` is not 0, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are reversed; however, the actual code provided reverses the first `size` elements. Since we know `size` is `n - 1`, the range being reversed is `arr[:size]`, which is the same as `arr[:n-1]`.

The initial state indicates that if `max_index` is not 0, then the elements from index 0 to `size - 1` (which is up to `n - 2`) are reversed. If `max_index` is 0, no modifications are made to `arr`.

Assuming `max_index` is not 0, `arr` will be updated with its first `size` elements reversed. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` has its first `n - 1` elements reversed; `n` is greater than 0, `size` is now `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.**
