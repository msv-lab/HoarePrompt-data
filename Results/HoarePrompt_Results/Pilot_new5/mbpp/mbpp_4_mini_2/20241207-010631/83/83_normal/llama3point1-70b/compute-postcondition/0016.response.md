The code assigns `max_index` the value of the index of the maximum element in the list `arr` up to the current `size` of 1. Given that `size` is 1, `arr[:size]` will be equivalent to `arr[:1]`, which means it will only include the first element of `arr`. The value of `max_index` will be the index of the maximum element found in that single-element list, which is always 0 since there is only one element.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `size` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `max_index` is 0.**
