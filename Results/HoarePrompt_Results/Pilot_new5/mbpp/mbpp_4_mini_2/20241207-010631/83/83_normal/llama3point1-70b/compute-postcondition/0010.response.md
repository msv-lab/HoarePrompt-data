The variable `max_index` is assigned the index of the maximum element in the slice of `arr` from the start to `size` (which is `n - 1`). The existing values of `arr`, `n`, and `size` remain unchanged. The value of `max_index` will be determined by finding the maximum value in `arr[:size]` and its corresponding index. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is now `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.**
