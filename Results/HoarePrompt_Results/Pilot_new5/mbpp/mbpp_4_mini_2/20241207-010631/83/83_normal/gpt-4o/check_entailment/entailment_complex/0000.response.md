Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. While the code is intended to sort a list of elements, it has several issues:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function `func_1` is designed to sort a list of elements but only assumes that the length of the list is greater than 1. It does not handle cases where the input list has a length of 0 or 1, which can lead to incorrect behavior or errors. An empty list or a list with a single element should not throw an error and should return the list as is.

2. **Global Variable Dependency**: The `flip` and `find_max_index` functions assume that the variable `arr` is globally defined. This reliance on a global variable can cause errors if `arr` is not accessible in the scope where these functions are called.

3. **Functionality**: The annotations suggest that the function sorts in ascending order based on the examples provided. However, the implementation in `func_1` is designed to sort the list in descending order, which contradicts the assumption made in the problem statement that the list should be sorted in any order (not specified). The problem description requires sorting, which is typically interpreted as sorting in ascending order unless specified otherwise.

Due to these issues, including the lack of handling for edge cases and global variable reliance, the code does not meet the correctness criteria for all potential inputs.
