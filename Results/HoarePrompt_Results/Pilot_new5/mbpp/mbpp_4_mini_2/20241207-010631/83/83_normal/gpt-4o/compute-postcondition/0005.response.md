According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 1 and continues while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute again if `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 2, and the condition for `i` suggests that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `max_index` is 1 (if updated in the current iteration)**
