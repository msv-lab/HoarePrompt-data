The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The previous value of `max_index` was 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_index` is now 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than the current value of `arr[max_index]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_index` is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than the current value of `arr[max_index]`.**
