The slice `arr[:max_index + 1]` represents the portion of the list `arr` from the start up to (and including) the element at index `max_index`. Since `max_index` is `0`, this slice refers to just the first element of the list `arr`. The operation `arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses this slice, but since it only consists of one element, reversing it will have no effect on its value. Therefore, the overall effect is that `arr[0]` remains unchanged, and the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `size` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `max_index` is 0, and `arr[0]` is unchanged.**
