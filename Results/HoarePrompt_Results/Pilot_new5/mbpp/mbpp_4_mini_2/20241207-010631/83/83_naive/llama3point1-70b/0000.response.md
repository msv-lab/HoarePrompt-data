To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code carefully.

### Problem Description:
Write a function to sort a list of elements.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
    return arr
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Sorting Logic**:
   - The program appears to implement a sorting algorithm based on repeatedly finding the maximum element in the unsorted section of the list and reversing parts of the list to place it in its correct position.

2. **Key Logical Flaw**:
   - The code uses `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` which finds the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value in the current unsorted section. This is problematic because if there are duplicate maximum values, it will only consider the first occurrence, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

3. **Potential Case of Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the input list `[3, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - The maximum in the first iteration will be `3`, which is found at index `0`. The subsequent logic will not correctly sort the array since it will not handle the second `3` correctly.

### Conclusion:
Since there exists at least one input where the program does not work as expected, it fails to meet the problem description of sorting a list of elements correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
