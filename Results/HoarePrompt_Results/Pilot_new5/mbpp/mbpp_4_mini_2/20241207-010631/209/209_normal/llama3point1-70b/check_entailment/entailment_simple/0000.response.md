Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where a sublist might be empty. If any sublist is empty, trying to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. According to the problem description, the function is expected to return the first element of each sublist, but it fails to account for the possibility that some sublists may not contain any elements. Therefore, the program does not always meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case.
