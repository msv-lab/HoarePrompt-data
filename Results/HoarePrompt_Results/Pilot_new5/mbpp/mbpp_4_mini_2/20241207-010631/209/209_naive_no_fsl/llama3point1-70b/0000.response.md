To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1` and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires a function that returns the first element of each sublist from a list of sublists.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

### Analysis:
1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in the input `sublists`.
2. It attempts to access the first element of each `sublist` using `sublist[0]`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Empty Sublists**: If any sublist is empty (i.e., `[]`), attempting to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. This case is particularly concerning because it means the function does not handle the situation where one or more of the sublists have no elements.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```python
sublists = [[], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
For this input, the first sublist is empty, and the function will attempt to execute `[]`, resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not handle the case of empty sublists and will crash with such input, it does not fulfill the problem description correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
