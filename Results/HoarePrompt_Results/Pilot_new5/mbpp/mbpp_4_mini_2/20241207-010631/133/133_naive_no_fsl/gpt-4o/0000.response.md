Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` assumes that the two input tuples will always be of the same length. If the two tuples have different lengths, the `zip` function will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple, leading to potential incorrect results. 

For example:
```python
func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5)) 
```
This would result in `(1 - 4, 2 - 5)`, which yields `(-3, -3)`, thus ignoring the third element of the first tuple.

This demonstrates a case where the program does not handle input tuples of different lengths correctly, so the correctness is **False**.
