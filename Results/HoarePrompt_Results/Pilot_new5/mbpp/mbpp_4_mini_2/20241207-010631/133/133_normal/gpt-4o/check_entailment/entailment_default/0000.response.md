To evaluate the correctness of the provided function `func_1`, we start by analyzing the problem description and the code.

**Problem description**: The function is supposed to take in two tuples and subtract the elements of the first tuple by those of the second tuple at the same index.

**Code**:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

Upon initial inspection, the code appears to correctly implement the desired functionality. It uses `zip` to pair up elements from both tuples and performs subtraction for each corresponding pair, returning the results as a new tuple.

**Potential edge cases**:
1. **Different Lengths**: The problem description does not specify behavior for tuples of different lengths, but `zip` will stop at the shortest tuple, which can lead to unexpected results if the user expects the function to handle tuples of varying lengths.
2. **Empty Tuples**: The function should also be able to handle empty tuples, returning an empty tuple as a result, which is consistent with the assumption that subtraction is defined for corresponding elements.

Let's check if the output hints align with the code's behavior:

**Output hints**: The function accepts two tuples and returns the differences between corresponding elements, assuming both tuples are of the same length. The hint mentions that if the tuples have different lengths, the behavior is undefined since `zip` will stop at the shortest tuple.

The output hints accurately describe the implementation of the code. They also point out that if the tuples are of different lengths, the code will not raise an error but will yield a result based only on the elements available in both tuples.

Based on this analysis:
- The function does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case since it lacks explicit handling for cases where the input tuples have different lengths. The behavior is indeed undefined in such cases, which is a significant issue in terms of correctness.
- Additionally, while subtraction will be performed correctly for equal-length tuples, if length mismatch occurs, it can lead to misleading results.

Thus, since the function does not correctly handle all specified cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to account for tuples of different lengths, which leads to potentially unexpected or incorrect behavior.
