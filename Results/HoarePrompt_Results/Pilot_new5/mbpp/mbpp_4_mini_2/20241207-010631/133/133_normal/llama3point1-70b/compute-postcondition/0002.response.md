Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of the two tuples, calculated as `(a - b)` for each pair of elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. It assumes both tuples are of the same length, and if they are not, a `ValueError` will be raised due to the behavior of `zip`. There are no checks for the types or values of the elements within the tuples, so if they contain non-numeric types, a `TypeError` will occur during the subtraction operation.**
