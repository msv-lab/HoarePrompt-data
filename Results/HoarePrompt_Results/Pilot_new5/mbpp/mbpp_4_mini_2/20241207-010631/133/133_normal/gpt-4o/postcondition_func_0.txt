The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. It assumes both tuples are of the same length and contain numerical values. If the tuples have different lengths, the behavior is undefined since `zip` will stop at the shortest tuple.
