Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The function uses a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor combined with the `zip()` function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously. For each pair of elements (one from `tup1` and the corresponding one from `tup2`), it subtracts the second element from the first (`a - b`).

3. **Tuple Output**: The result of this subtraction for all pairs is returned as a new tuple, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to return the differences in the same indexed positions.

4. **Correctness of Examples**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases, and they confirm that the function produces the expected results for those specific inputs. The output tuples reflect the correct element-wise differences.

Because the implementation fulfills the criteria specified in the problem description for all potential cases that fit the defined structure (two tuples of the same length containing numerical values), we conclude that the program is correct.
