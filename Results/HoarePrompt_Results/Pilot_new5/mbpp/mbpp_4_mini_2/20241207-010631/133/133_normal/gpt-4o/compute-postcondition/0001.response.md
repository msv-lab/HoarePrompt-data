The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numerical values. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple that contains the differences between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of numerical values and return a tuple of the differences between their corresponding elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, tup1 and tup2, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of tup1 and tup2.**
