Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and uses a generator expression alongside the `zip` function to subtract the corresponding elements of the two tuples index by index. 

It handles the following cases:
- If both tuples are of the same length, it will correctly compute the differences for all corresponding elements.
- If one tuple is shorter than the other, the `zip` function ensures that only the pairs of elements that exist will be processed, avoiding any index errors.
- If both tuples are empty, it will return an empty tuple, which is the expected behavior.

Since it satisfies the requirements of the problem for all potential input cases, the program is correct.
