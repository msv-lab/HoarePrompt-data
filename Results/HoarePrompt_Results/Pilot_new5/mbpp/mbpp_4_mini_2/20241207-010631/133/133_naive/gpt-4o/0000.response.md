Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the two input tuples have different lengths. The problem description implies that the function should subtract elements at the same index, which requires both tuples to have the same length. If they do not, the `zip` function will truncate the longer tuple, leading to potential data loss and incorrect results. 

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2), (1, 2, 3))`, the function will only compute `(1-1, 2-2)`, returning `(0, 0)` instead of raising an error or handling the mismatch appropriately. This indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
