Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description in all potential cases. While the function `func_1(nums)` correctly returns the smallest number in a list of numbers using the `min()` function, it fails to handle the case where the input list `nums` is empty.

According to the problem description, the function should find the smallest number in a list, but if the list is empty, the function raises a `ValueError`. This behavior is not acceptable as it does not provide a valid output for all potential inputs (i.e., it should ideally handle empty lists gracefully instead of raising an error).

Thus, since the function does not correctly address the case of an empty list, it does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description.
