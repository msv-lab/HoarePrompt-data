Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it directly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to find the smallest number in a list. The function `func_1(nums)` uses Python's built-in `min()` function, which accurately returns the minimum value from the provided list of numbers (i.e., `nums`). 

This implementation will work correctly for all potential cases, including:
- Non-empty lists containing integers or floats.
- Lists with negative numbers.
- Lists with repeated elements (it will still return the smallest).
- Lists with only one element (the function will return that single element).

The only edge case that is not handled is if the list `nums` is empty; however, the problem description does not specify how to handle empty lists. Given that the description does not state that the function must handle empty lists, the implementation is correct based on the provided requirements.
