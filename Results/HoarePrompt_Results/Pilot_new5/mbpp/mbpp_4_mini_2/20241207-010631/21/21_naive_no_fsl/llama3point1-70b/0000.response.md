Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the input list `nums` is empty. If `nums` is empty, calling `min(nums)` will raise a `ValueError`, indicating that there is no minimum value to return. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of finding the smallest number in all potential cases, specifically when the input list is empty.
