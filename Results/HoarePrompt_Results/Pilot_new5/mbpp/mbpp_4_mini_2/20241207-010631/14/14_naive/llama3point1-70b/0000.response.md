Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` is intended to determine whether an array of integers contains any duplicate elements. The logic used in the function is to compare the length of the original list (`arr`) with the length of a set created from that list (`set(arr)`). However, the function incorrectly returns `True` for the presence of duplicates and `False` for their absence.

For example:
- If `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `len(arr)` will be `4` and `len(set(arr))` will also be `4`, so the function would return `False`, indicating no duplicates, which is correct.
- However, if `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, `len(arr)` will be `4` and `len(set(arr))` will be `3`, so the function will return `True`, indicating duplicates, which is again correct.

The issue arises because the return value of the function is inverted; it should return `True` for duplicates and `False` for no duplicates. 

Therefore, the function should actually be:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) == len(set(arr))
```

As is, the function fails to meet the intended logic correctly, and thus the correctness is deemed false.
