Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers. It uses a set to track the numbers seen so far. As it iterates through the array, it checks if the current number is already in the set. If it finds a duplicate, it returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, it returns `False`. 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works for various test cases, including:
- An array with all unique elements (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), which correctly returns `False`.
- An array with a single duplicate (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`), which correctly returns `True`.
- An array with multiple duplicates (`[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`), which also correctly returns `True`.

Overall, the function handles the specified cases and adheres to the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.
