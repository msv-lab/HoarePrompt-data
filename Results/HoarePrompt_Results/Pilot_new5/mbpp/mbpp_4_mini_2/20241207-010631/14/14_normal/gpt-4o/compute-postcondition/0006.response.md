According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `arr`, and `seen` is a set containing `num`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 integers, and `num` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that has at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `arr`, `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr`**
