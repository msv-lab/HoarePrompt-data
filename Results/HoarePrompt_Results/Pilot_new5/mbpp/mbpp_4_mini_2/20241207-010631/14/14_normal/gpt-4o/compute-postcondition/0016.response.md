The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. The function examines the contents of `arr` and evaluates certain conditions based on its elements. 

The function can return in several cases:
- Case 1: If a certain condition is met, the function returns `True`, indicating that an element is present in a set called 'seen'.
- Case 2: If a specific criteria is met, related to the second integer in `arr` and the set 'seen', the function returns `True`.
- Case 3: If another condition for returning `True` is satisfied, the function returns `True`.
- Case 4: If there is at least one duplicate integer in the list `arr`, the function returns `False`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return `True` or `False` based on the conditions evaluated within the list, indicating the presence of certain elements and the presence of duplicates. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, a list of integers, and returns True if certain conditions are met or False if there are duplicate integers in the list.**
