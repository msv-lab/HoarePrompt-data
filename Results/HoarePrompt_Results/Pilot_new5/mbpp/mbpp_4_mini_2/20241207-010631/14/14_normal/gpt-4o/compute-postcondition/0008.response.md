Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second integer in `arr`, and `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr`. If `num` is in `seen`, the function returns True, indicating that `num` meets a specific criteria with respect to `seen`. If `num` is not in `seen`, the program does not return anything.***
