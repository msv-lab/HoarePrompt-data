Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description as stated. According to the problem description, the function must determine whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` has the logic reversed in its return values. The function returns `True` when it finds a duplicate and `False` when there are no duplicates.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the issue:

1. **Expected Behavior**: The function should return `True` if there are duplicates in the list and `False` if all integers are unique.
  
2. **Implemented Behavior**: The function returns `True` upon finding a duplicate (which is correct) but then incorrectly returns `False` at the end, stating that there are no duplicates when it should indicate that the duplicates exist.

3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the final return value contradicts the expected behavior as described in the problem statement. The comments in the program also indicate that the final return value of `False` signifies that there are duplicates, which is incorrect.

To correct the implementation, the return statement at the end of the function should be `return True` when there are no duplicates and `return False` when duplicates are found.
