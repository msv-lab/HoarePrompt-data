According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` variable. If `arr` is not empty, the loop will execute. Since `seen` is an empty set and does not influence the execution of the loop, it does not need adjustment. To ensure the loop can run, `arr` must have at least 1 integer, and at the start of the loop, `num` should be the first integer in `arr`. 

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `arr`, `seen` is an empty set**
