Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third integer in `arr`, and `seen` is a set containing the first and second integers in `arr` along with `num`. If `num` is in `seen`, the function returns True, indicating that the condition for returning True has been satisfied. If `num` is not in `seen`, the function does not return any value.***
