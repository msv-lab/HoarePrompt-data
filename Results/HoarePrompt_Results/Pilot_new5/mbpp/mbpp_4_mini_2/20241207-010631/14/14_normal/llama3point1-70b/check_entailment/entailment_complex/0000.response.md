Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It checks whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements by comparing the length of the original list `arr` with the length of a set created from `arr`. Since a set inherently removes duplicates, if there are any duplicate integers in the list, the length of the set will be less than the length of the original list.

Hereâ€™s why it always meets the problem description:

1. **Correct Logic**: The function uses `len(arr) != len(set(arr))` to determine if there are duplicates. If duplicates exist, the length of the set (which has removed duplicates) will be smaller than that of the original array.

2. **Boolean Return Value**: The function returns `True` if duplicates are found and `False` otherwise, matching the expected output as outlined in the problem description.

3. **Handles Edge Cases**: It correctly handles cases such as empty lists, returning `False` since there are no elements to be duplicates.

Overall, the function behaves correctly for all potential cases defined in the problem description, thus validating its correctness.
