Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requests a function to determine whether an array contains any duplicate elements, but the function `func_1` returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are none. This is the opposite of what is needed.

To elaborate, the function checks if the length of the original array `arr` is different from the length of the set created from `arr`. When duplicates are present, the lengths will differ, and `len(arr) != len(set(arr))` will evaluate to `True`, indicating that duplicates exist. However, the problem description requires a function that explicitly states if duplicates are present, which would mean returning `True` for duplicates and `False` for no duplicates. 

Thus, the function's return value contradicts the expected output as per the problem description. The implementation is not correct, as it does not align with the requirement to indicate the presence or absence of duplicates.
