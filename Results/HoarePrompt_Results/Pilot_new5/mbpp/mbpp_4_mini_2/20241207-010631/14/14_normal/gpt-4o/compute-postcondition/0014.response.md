Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from `arr`. If there are no duplicates in `arr`, the loop will execute for every integer in `arr` and `num` will be the last integer in `arr`. If there are duplicates, the loop will stop executing upon encountering the first duplicate integer.**
