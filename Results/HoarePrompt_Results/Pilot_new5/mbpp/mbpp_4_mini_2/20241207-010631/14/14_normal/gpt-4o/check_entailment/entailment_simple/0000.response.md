Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement specified in the problem description. 

The issue lies in the comment right before the return statement: `#The program returns False, indicating that there is at least one duplicate integer in the list 'arr'.` This comment is misleading, as the function actually returns `False` when there are **no duplicates** in the input list, and `True` when there is at least one duplicate. Therefore, the explanation in the comment does not accurately reflect the function's behavior.

Since the problem description requires the function to find whether a given array contains any duplicate elements, and the implementation does not correctly represent this logic (as evidenced by the incorrect comment), the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases. 

In summary, the return values do not align with the expected output described in the problem, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
