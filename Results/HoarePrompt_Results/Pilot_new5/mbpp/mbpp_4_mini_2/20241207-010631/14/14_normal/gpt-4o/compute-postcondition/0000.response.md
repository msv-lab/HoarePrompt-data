The variable `seen` is assigned an empty set. The variable `arr`, which is a list of integers, remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `seen` is now an empty set while the initial state of `arr` is preserved.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is an empty set.**
