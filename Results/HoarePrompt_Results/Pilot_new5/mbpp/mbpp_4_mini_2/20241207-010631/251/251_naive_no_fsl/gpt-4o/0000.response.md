Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). 

1. The function `func_1` computes 'r' using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which correctly calculates the radius in polar coordinates.
2. It computes 'θ' using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians considering the correct quadrant for the given (x, y) coordinates.

The assertions provided in the program check specific cases, and all output values match the expected polar coordinates for the input rectangular coordinates. 

Additionally, the formulae used in the function handle all quadrants correctly due to the properties of `atan2`. Therefore, there are no edge cases or potential scenarios where the function would fail to convert the coordinates correctly.

Since all examples provided and potential edge cases have been considered, the conclusion is that the program functions as intended according to the problem description.
