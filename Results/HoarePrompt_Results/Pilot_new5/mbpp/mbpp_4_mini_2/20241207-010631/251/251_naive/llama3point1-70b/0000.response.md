Correctness: **True**.

The program converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) into polar coordinates (r, φ) using the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radius (r) and `math.atan2` to calculate the angle (φ). 

1. The radius `r` is computed correctly as the Euclidean distance from the origin using `math.hypot`, which handles all quadrants and points correctly.
2. The angle `φ` is computed using `math.atan2`, which accounts for the signs of `x` and `y`, ensuring that the angle returns the correct value in the range of (-π, π).

Since these functions properly handle all edge cases, including points on axes and at the origin, the program is correct for any valid input of rectangular coordinates.
