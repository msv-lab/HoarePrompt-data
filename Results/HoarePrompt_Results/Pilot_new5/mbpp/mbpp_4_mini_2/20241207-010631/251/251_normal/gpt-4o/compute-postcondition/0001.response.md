The variable `theta` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which computes the angle (in radians) from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y). The previous values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the calculation of `theta` based on the current values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is the square root of `x`; `theta` is the angle calculated as `math.atan2(y, x)`**.
