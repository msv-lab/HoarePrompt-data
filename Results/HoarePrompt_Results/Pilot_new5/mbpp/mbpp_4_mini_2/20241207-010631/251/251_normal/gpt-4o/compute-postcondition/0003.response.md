The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, it returns `r`, which is the square root of `x`, and `theta`, which is the angle calculated as `math.atan2(y, x)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers representing coordinates and return their corresponding polar coordinates: the radius `r` and the angle `theta`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, both floating-point numbers representing rectangular coordinates, and returns r (the square root of x) and theta (the angle calculated as math.atan2(y, x)).**
