The variable `phi` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which calculates the angle (in radians) between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y) represented by the coordinates. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `r` continues to be the positive floating-point number equal to `math.hypot(x, y)`. The output state reflects the new value of `phi` based on the coordinates provided.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is a positive floating-point number equal to `math.hypot(x, y)`; `phi` is equal to `math.atan2(y, x)`.**
