Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. Let's analyze the function `func_1`:

1. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list `lst`.
2. It checks if each element is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`.
3. For each integer found, it yields `1`, which is summed up to give the total count of integer elements.

The assertions provided in the program cover various scenarios:
- `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` counts 2 integers (1 and 2).
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` counts 3 integers (1, 2, and 3).
- `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` counts 2 integers (1 and 4).

Additionally, based on the code logic, it will correctly handle any list containing a mix of integers, floats, strings, and other types:

- If the list is empty, the function will return 0, which is correct.
- If the list contains no integers, such as `['abc', 1.2, True]`, the function will return 0, which is also correct.

Since there are no cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.
