You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, which may include integers and other data types.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst' by summing 1 for each element that is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements within that list. It ignores all other data types, and if the list is empty, it returns 0, as there are no integers to count.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
