Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as an argument and counts the number of integer elements in that list. This is achieved using a generator expression that iterates through each element `x` in `lst` and checks if `x` is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance(x, int)` function. For every integer found, it sums `1`, giving the total count of integer elements.

The provided assertions further confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` returns `2`, correctly counting the integers `1` and `2`.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `3`, correctly counting `1`, `2`, and `3`.
- `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` returns `2`, correctly counting the integers `1` and `4`.

Overall, the function meets the requirements of the problem description, ensuring that it accurately counts and returns the number of integer elements in the input list, regardless of the presence of other data types.
