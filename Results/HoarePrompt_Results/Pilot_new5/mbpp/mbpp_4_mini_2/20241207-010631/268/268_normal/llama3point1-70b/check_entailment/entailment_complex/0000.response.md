Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

1. The problem description specifies that the function should return the maximum of the n'th column. However, in the annotated program, the function attempts to access the (n-1)th column instead of the nth column. This means that if `n` is 1, it will correctly return the maximum of the first column, but if `n` is, for example, 0, it will attempt to access an invalid index (`-1`), which leads to an `IndexError`.

2. Additionally, there is no handling for the case when `n` is 0. According to the requirements, if `n` is 0, it is specified that the function should not try to access the (n-1)th column as it would be out-of-bounds. The lack of proper error handling for this case makes the function incorrect.

Therefore, the function fails to correctly implement the requirements laid out in the problem description.
