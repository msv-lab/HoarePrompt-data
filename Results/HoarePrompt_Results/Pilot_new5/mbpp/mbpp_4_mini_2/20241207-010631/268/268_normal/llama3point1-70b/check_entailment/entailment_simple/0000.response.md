Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it incorrectly accesses the nth column of the matrix. According to the problem description, the function should return the maximum value of the n-th column, where n is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`. However, the program accesses the (n-1)th column (`row[n - 1]`), which means it is off by one. 

For example, if `n` is 1, the program will retrieve the values from the 0th column rather than the 1st column, which is not what the problem description requires. This will lead to incorrect results for any value of `n` that is greater than 0. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
