The program description specifies that the function should return the maximum value from the n-th column of a matrix represented as a list of lists. To access the n-th column, the code retrieves elements from the (n-1)-th index of each row.

Initially assessing the code, it appears to function correctly for positive values of n (i.e., n > 0). However, if n = 0, as the output hints indicate, it would lead to an IndexError because it attempts to access the (n-1)-th index, which would be -1, an out-of-bounds index for any row in the matrix.

Now examining the output hints, they confirm that if n is 0, an IndexError occurs. This aligns with the earlier identified edge case, demonstrating that the code does not handle this situation appropriately.

Thus, since the program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases (specifically when n = 0), we must conclude that it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The code fails to handle the case when n = 0, leading to an IndexError due to attempting to access an out-of-bounds index (-1).
