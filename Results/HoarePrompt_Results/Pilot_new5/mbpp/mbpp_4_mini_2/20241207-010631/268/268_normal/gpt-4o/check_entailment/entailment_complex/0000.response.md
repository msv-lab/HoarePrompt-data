Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, the function does not account for the possibility that the input `matrix` could be empty. If an empty matrix is provided, the function will attempt to access the `n`th index of non-existent rows, leading to an `IndexError`. 

Additionally, the function does not validate whether `n` is within the valid range (i.e., `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`) before attempting to access the column. If `n` is larger than the number of columns in the rows of the matrix, it will also raise an `IndexError`. 

According to the problem description, the function should not raise errors when given invalid input; rather, it should handle such cases appropriately. Therefore, the implementation does not fully satisfy the problem requirements.
