#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists, each containing numerical values, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is non-empty.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `nth_column`, which contains the `n`th elements from each row of the `matrix`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the `n`th column of the `matrix`. However, if `matrix` is empty or if `n` is out of bounds (i.e., greater than or equal to the number of columns in any row of `matrix`), it will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, it is important to ensure that `matrix` is not empty and that `n` is within the valid range before calling this function to avoid potential errors.
