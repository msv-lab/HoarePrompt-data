To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its functionality against the problem description. The program is supposed to return the maximum value of the nth column from a matrix represented as a list of lists.

Let's break down the program and check for edge cases:

1. The function `func_1(matrix, n)` is defined to take a matrix and an integer `n` representing the column index.
2. The line `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]` attempts to create a list of elements from the nth column of the matrix.
3. The function then returns `max(nth_column)`, which finds the maximum value from the list of elements in the nth column.

Now, let's consider the requirements of the problem:

- If `n` is out of bounds (i.e., if `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in any of the rows in the matrix), this will result in an `IndexError` because we are trying to access an index that does not exist in the list.

### Testing Edge Cases
- If we pass an empty matrix (e.g., `func_1([], 0)`), it should ideally handle the case gracefully, but the current implementation will throw an `IndexError`.
- If we pass a matrix with fewer columns than `n` (e.g., `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 2)`), it will again result in an `IndexError`.
- If we pass a matrix with only one row and access a valid index (e.g., `func_1([[1, 2, 3]], 1)`), it works as expected, but the program fails in the aforementioned edge cases.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds (either too large or accessing a non-existent column in an empty matrix), it results in incorrect behavior for these potential cases.

Thus, the conclusion about the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function does not handle cases where the input column index `n` exceeds the number of columns in the matrix or if the matrix is empty, which would lead to an `IndexError`.
