To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem description:** Write a function which, given a matrix represented as a list of lists, returns the max of the n-th column.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function expects a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, which indicates the n-th column (1-based index).
2. The code tries to find the maximum of the n-th column by using a generator expression that extracts `row[n - 1]` for each `row` in the matrix.

**Potential Issues:**
- If `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in the matrix, accessing `row[n - 1]` will raise an `IndexError`. This means that the function does not handle cases where `n` is invalid (out of range).
- If the matrix is empty, the program will also raise a `ValueError` because the `max` function cannot operate on an empty iterable.

**Test Cases:**
- For an empty matrix: `func_1([], 1)` should ideally return an error or a specific value, but it will raise an error.
- For a valid matrix but invalid `n`: `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 3)` should raise an error as there is no third column.
- For a valid case: `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 2)` should return `5`.

Since the function does not handle the cases where `n` is out of bounds or if the matrix is empty, it will fail for these inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
