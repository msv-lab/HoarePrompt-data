Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number `b` first and the first number `a` second. This implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

To verify its correctness, we can consider various input cases:

1. For `func_1(1, 2)`, it returns `(2, 1)`, which is correct.
2. For `func_1(5, 10)`, it returns `(10, 5)`, which is also correct.
3. For `func_1(-1, -2)`, it returns `(-2, -1)`, which is correct.
4. For `func_1(0, 1)`, it returns `(1, 0)`, which is also correct.

Since the function behaves as expected for all the examples considered, we can conclude that it satisfies the problem's requirement in every case. Therefore, the program is correct.
