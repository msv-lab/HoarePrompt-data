Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number (`b`) first and the first number (`a`) second. 

This behavior matches exactly what is described in the problem: "returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number." The function does not have any edge cases or missing functionality; it consistently returns the parameters in the specified order for any valid input of numbers. Therefore, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
