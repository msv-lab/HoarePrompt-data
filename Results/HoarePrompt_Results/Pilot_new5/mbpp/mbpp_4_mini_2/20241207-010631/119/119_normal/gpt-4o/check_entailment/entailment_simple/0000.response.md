Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two numbers as input parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple where the first element is the second number (`b`) and the second element is the first number (`a`). This matches the requirement of the problem description, which states that the function should return a tuple with the second number first followed by the first number.

The assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is correct.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which is correct.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, which is correct.

Since the function has been tested with different inputs and consistently returns the correct output as per the problem description, we can conclude that the implementation is correct.
