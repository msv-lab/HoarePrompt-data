Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers as arguments, `a` and `b`. It returns a tuple in the order of (second number, first number), which corresponds to (b, a). 

This aligns with the requirement stated in the problem description that the function should return a tuple with the second number first and the first number second. 

No edge cases or special scenarios are present that would cause it to deviate from this behavior. Thus, the program consistently does what the problem description asks for all potential inputs.
