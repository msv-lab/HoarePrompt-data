The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the values of `b` and `a` in that order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two numbers, `a` and `b`, and return them in reversed order with `b` first and `a` second.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, and returns the values of b and a in that order.**
