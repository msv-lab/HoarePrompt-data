Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that are located at odd index values. It uses a list comprehension that iterates through the string, checking the index of each character. If the index is even (indicating that it is not an odd index), it includes that character in the result. 

The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that it works for a variety of cases:
- For the input `'abcdef'`, the characters at indices 0, 2, and 4 are included, resulting in `'ace'`.
- For the input `'python'`, the characters at indices 0, 2, and 4 are included, resulting in `'pto'`.
- For the input `'data'`, the characters at indices 0 and 2 are included, resulting in `'dt'`.
- For the input `'lambs'`, the characters at indices 0, 2, and 4 are included, resulting in `'lms'`.

Additionally, edge cases such as an empty string or a string of a single character would also return the expected results, further confirming the function's correctness. Therefore, the function operates as intended for all examined cases.
