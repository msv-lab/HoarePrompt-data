Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that removes characters with odd index values from a given string, meaning that characters that are located at odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.) should be omitted from the final result. However, the provided code instead retains characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) and returns those. 

For example, with the input `'abcdef'`, the expected output according to the problem description should be `'bdf'` (removing 'a', 'c', 'e' from odd indices), but the function returns `'ace'`, which is incorrect.

This discrepancy shows that the logic within `func_1` does not align with the original task of removing odd indexed characters, thereby making the program incorrect.
