#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None as the return statement explicitly specifies this value regardless of the state of `unique_nums`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a list containing the unique integers from `nums`. The length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`, which is obtained by sorting `unique_nums` and accessing the second element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two elements and returns None if all elements in `nums` are the same, or the second smallest unique integer from `nums` if applicable. If there are fewer than two unique integers in the list, it returns None. If there are at least two unique integers, it sorts the unique values and returns the second smallest element.
