To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's start with the problem description and the code:

**Problem description:** Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two elements and returns None if all elements in `nums` are the same, or the second smallest unique integer from `nums` if applicable. If there are fewer than two unique integers in the list, it returns None. If there are at least two unique integers, it sorts the unique values and returns the second smallest element.

### Initial Assessment:
The program appears to create a set from the input list `nums` to eliminate duplicates, then converts it back to a list called `unique_nums`. It checks if `unique_nums` has fewer than two elements and returns `None` if so. If there are at least two unique integers, it sorts `unique_nums` and returns the second smallest integer.

### Edge Cases:
1. **List with fewer than two unique elements:** The function returns `None`, which is correct as per the problem description.
2. **List with exactly two unique elements:** The function will correctly return the second smallest, as it sorts the two unique numbers.
3. **List with only one unique element (e.g., `[5, 5, 5]`):** The function again correctly returns `None`.
4. **List with multiple duplicates (e.g., `[5, 1, 1, 5]`):** The function should correctly identify `1` as the smallest and `5` as the second smallest, returning `5`.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints align well with the program description and the code. They specify that:
- The function returns `None` if all elements in `nums` are the same.
- It returns the second smallest unique integer when there are at least two unique integers.
- The description is consistent with the behavior exhibited in the code.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in the function covers all potential cases outlined in the problem description, including those handled by the output hints. I can't find any scenarios where the function fails to behave as expected based on the given description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly identifies the second smallest unique number from the list and handles the described edge cases appropriately.
