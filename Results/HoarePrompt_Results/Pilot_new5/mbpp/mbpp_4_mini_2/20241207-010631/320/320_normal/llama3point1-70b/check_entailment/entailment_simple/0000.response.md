Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the problem description of finding the second smallest number in a list of integers. Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Unique Elements**: The program first converts the input list `nums` into a set to remove any duplicate values, and then converts it back into a list called `unique_nums`. This ensures that only unique integers are considered when finding the second smallest number.

2. **Minimum Requirement Check**: The program checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. According to the problem description, the input list has at least two elements. Therefore, under normal conditions based on the given assumption, `unique_nums` will always contain at least two unique numbers. However, the check for `len(unique_nums) < 2` is a safeguard that does not affect the correctness since the problem states that `nums` has at least two elements.

3. **Finding the Second Smallest Number**: After ensuring that there are at least two unique numbers, the program sorts `unique_nums` and returns the second element (index 1) of the sorted list. This guarantees that the returned value is the second smallest unique integer.

Since the program is designed to handle the scenario described in the problem with the necessary checks and operations, it correctly finds the second smallest number in the list as required. There are no cases in the provided description that would cause it to fail in fulfilling the task.
