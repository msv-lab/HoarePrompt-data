The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two elements and returns None if all elements in `nums` are the same, or the second smallest unique integer from `nums` if applicable. If there are fewer than two unique integers in the list, it returns None. If there are at least two unique integers, it sorts the unique values and returns the second smallest element.
