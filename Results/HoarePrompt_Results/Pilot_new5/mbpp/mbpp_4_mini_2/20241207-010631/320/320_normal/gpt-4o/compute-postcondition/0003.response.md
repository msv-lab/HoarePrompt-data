Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` which is guaranteed to contain at least two distinct elements. It returns the second smallest unique integer from the list. If there are not enough unique elements (which theoretically shouldn't happen due to the precondition), it would return None. However, based on the implementation, it reliably returns the second unique number when there are at least two distinct integers. **
