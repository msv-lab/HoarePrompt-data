Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement of finding the second smallest number in a list of integers. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Handling Unique Values**: The program first converts the list of integers to a set to remove any duplicate values, then converts it back to a list (`unique_nums`). This ensures that only unique integers are considered when determining the second smallest number.

2. **Checking for Unique Count**: It checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If there are fewer than two unique values, it returns `None`. This handles the case where all elements in the original list are the same, which aligns with the requirement to find the second smallest number.

3. **Returning the Second Smallest**: If there are at least two unique integers, the program sorts the list of unique integers and retrieves the second element (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`), which is the second smallest number. This satisfies the requirement of the problem description.

4. **Input Assumptions**: The program also correctly assumes that the input list contains at least two elements, which is a precondition stated in the comments.

Overall, the program covers all potential cases for the problem description, ensuring it returns the correct second smallest number or `None` when applicable, hence it is correct.
