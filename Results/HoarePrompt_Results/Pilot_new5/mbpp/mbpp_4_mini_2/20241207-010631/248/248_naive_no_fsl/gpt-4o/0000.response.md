Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function `func_1` that converts a list to a tuple. The assertions provided in the program test the function with various lists, and in each case, the output matches the expected tuple representation of the input list.

I did not find any potential cases where the function would fail to convert a list to a tuple, including edge cases such as an empty list or a list with different data types (e.g., strings, floats). The function should work correctly for all possible lists, and the provided assertions confirm its correctness across different examples.

Therefore, since the function meets the problem's description and handles the expected cases, the result is confirmed as correct.
