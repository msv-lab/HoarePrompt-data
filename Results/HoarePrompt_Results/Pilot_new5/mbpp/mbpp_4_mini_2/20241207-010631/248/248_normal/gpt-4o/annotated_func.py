#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)
    #The program returns a tuple containing the elements of the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns a tuple containing the elements of the list. It does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or not a list, but it will return an empty tuple if `lst` is empty. If `lst` is not a list, it may raise a TypeError.
