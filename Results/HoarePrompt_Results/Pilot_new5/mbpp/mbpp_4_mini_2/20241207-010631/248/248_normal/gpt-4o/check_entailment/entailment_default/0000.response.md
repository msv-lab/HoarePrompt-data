The provided code snippet aims to convert a list to a tuple. Upon examining the code, it appears to fulfill the basic requirement of converting a list to a tuple using Python's built-in `tuple()` function. 

However, examining edge cases reveals potential shortcomings. The problem description does not specify behavior for an empty input or for inputs that are not lists. 

The output hints confirm that the function returns an empty tuple if the list is empty, which is expected behavior. However, they also mention that if the input `lst` is not a list, the function may raise a `TypeError`. The problem description does not indicate that the function should handle non-list inputs gracefully, which means that it does not meet the requirement of handling all potential cases as described.

Therefore, since the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically, non-list inputs), the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails if it receives an input that is not a list, which is a potential case not addressed in the problem description.
