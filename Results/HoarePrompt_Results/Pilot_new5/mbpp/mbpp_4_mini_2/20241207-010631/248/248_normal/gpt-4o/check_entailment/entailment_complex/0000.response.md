Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description due to the following reason:

1. **Type Handling**: While the function `func_1(lst)` is designed to convert a list to a tuple as specified, it does not handle cases where `lst` might not be a list. If a non-list type (e.g., a string, integer, etc.) is passed to the function, it will raise a `TypeError`. This behavior is problematic since the problem description does not mention that the function is only valid for lists. Therefore, it does not handle all potential cases as required.

2. **Empty List Case**: Although the function correctly returns an empty tuple when an empty list is provided, the potential for raising errors when given an incorrect type makes it unreliable.

Thus, the implementation is not sufficiently robust to be considered correct as per the problem statement. A correct implementation should either explicitly check the type of `lst` or document that it only works with lists.
