Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from that list. This behavior adheres to the requirement of converting a list to a tuple.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Type**: The function accepts `input_list`, which is specified to be a list of elements of any data type. The function does not impose any restrictions on the types of elements within this list.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list into a tuple. This is the correct and expected way to perform this conversion in Python.

3. **Output Type**: The output is indeed a tuple, as required. The program does not alter the order of the elements or their types; it merely changes their container from a list to a tuple.

4. **Generality**: The function will work for all lists, including empty lists, lists of varying sizes, and lists containing mixed data types, meeting the problem's requirement comprehensively.

Since the function fulfills the problem description accurately in all respects, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
