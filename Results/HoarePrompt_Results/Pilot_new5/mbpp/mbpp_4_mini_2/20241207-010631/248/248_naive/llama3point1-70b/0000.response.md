Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple using Python's built-in `tuple()` function. This function will work for all potential cases, including empty lists, lists containing different data types, and nested lists. Here are a few examples:

1. `func_1([])` returns `()`, which is the expected output for an empty list.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 3)`, which is correct.
3. `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'])` returns `('a', 'b', 'c')`, which is also correct.
4. `func_1([[1], [2], [3]])` returns `([1], [2], [3])`, which shows it handles nested lists correctly.

Thus, the function meets the problem description requirements in all cases.
