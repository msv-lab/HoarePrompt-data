To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that gets the angle of a complex number. The angle (or phase) of a complex number can be computed using the `cmath.phase` function, which returns the angle in radians.

### Program Analysis
1. The function `func_1(real, imag)` converts the provided real and imaginary parts into a complex number and returns its phase using `cmath.phase()`.
2. The program includes assertions that check the correctness of `func_1` for specific complex numbers:
   - `func_1(0, 1j)` corresponds to the complex number `0 + 1j`, which has a phase of \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) (or approximately `1.5707963267948966`).
   - `func_1(2, 1j)` corresponds to the complex number `2 + 1j`, which has a phase of approximately `0.4636476090008061`.
   - `func_1(0, 2j)` corresponds to the complex number `0 + 2j`, which again has a phase of \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) (or `1.5707963267948966`).

### Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases:
- **Positive real number**: `func_1(1, 0)` should return `0.0`, as the angle of a positive real number is `0`.
- **Negative real number**: `func_1(-1, 0)` should return `3.141592653589793` (or `π`), as the angle of a negative real number is `π`.
- **Complex number with both parts**: `func_1(1, 1)` should return approximately `0.7853981633974483` (or `π/4`).
- **Zero input**: `func_1(0, 0)` is technically undefined in terms of phase; various systems may return `0`, but the angle is not defined.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the angles for the tested cases. However, it does not handle the case where both the real and imaginary parts are `0`, which is a significant edge case. Since it does not correctly handle this edge case, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The specific case where the function does not return a correct or defined output is `func_1(0, 0)`. The phase of the zero complex number is not well-defined, and therefore the function can yield an incorrect or misleading result in this case.
