Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to get the angle (or phase) of a complex number. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Inputs**: The function `func_1(real, imag)` takes two float arguments, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Complex Number Construction**: Inside the function, a complex number is created using `complex(real, imag)`, which is the correct way to represent a complex number in Python.

3. **Phase Calculation**: The program uses `cmath.phase(complex_number)` to compute the angle (or phase) of the complex number. The `cmath.phase` function is designed to return the argument of the complex number, which matches the requirement of the problem.

4. **Assertions for Validation**: The provided assertions utilize `math.isclose` to validate that the output of the function is accurate to within a relative tolerance of `0.001` for some test cases. This further confirms that the function is performing as expected for various inputs.

5. **Handling Valid Inputs**: The comment at the end of the annotated code mentions that there are no edge cases or missing functionality, indicating that the function is expected to work correctly for any valid floating-point input. This means it will handle all valid complex numbers by construction.

In conclusion, the function adheres to the problem's requirements by correctly computing the angle of a complex number constructed from the provided real and imaginary parts. Thus, it meets the problem description completely.
