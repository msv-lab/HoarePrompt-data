Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. This aligns with the problem description that asks for a function to handle these components.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: Inside the function, the line `complex_num = complex(real, imag)` creates a complex number using the provided real and imaginary parts. This is essential for calculating the angle of the complex number.

3. **Phase Calculation**: The function then uses `cmath.phase(complex_num)` to compute the phase angle (or argument) of the complex number. The phase angle is the angle formed by the complex number in the complex plane, fulfilling the requirement to get the angle of the complex number.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed phase angle in radians, which is the expected output as per the problem description.

5. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The comments mention that there are no edge cases or missing logic in this function. The `cmath.phase` function handles various cases, including when the magnitude of the complex number is zero, ensuring that the program behaves correctly for all valid inputs.

Overall, the program accurately follows the problem description by computing and returning the angle of a complex number formed from the given real and imaginary parts.
