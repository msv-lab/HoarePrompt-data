The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the phase of the complex number constructed from `real` and `imag`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, and return the phase of the complex number represented by these two parts.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `real` and `imag`, both floating-point numbers, and returns the phase of the complex number constructed from `real` and `imag`.**
