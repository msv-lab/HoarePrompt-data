The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number formed by these parts. There are no edge cases or missing logic in this function, as it directly computes the phase angle from the provided parameters.
