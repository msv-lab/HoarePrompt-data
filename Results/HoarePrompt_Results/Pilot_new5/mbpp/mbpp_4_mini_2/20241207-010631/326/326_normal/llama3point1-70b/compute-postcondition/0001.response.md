The value of `min_diff` is assigned to be positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This indicates that `min_diff` is now initialized to represent the largest possible value, which can be used for comparison against other differences in subsequent calculations. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity.**
