Output State: **The program returns min_diff, which is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr'. If 'n' is 2, min_diff is equal to arr[1] - arr[0]. If 'n' is greater than 2, min_diff is the smallest difference found between all pairs of consecutive elements in 'arr'.**
