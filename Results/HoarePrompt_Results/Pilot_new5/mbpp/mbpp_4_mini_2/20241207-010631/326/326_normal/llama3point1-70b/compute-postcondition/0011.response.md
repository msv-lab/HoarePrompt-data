According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the sorted list `arr`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `arr` has at least 3 elements, `len(arr)` is at least 3, which means `len(arr) - 1` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `len(arr)` must be at least 3 (which it is), and `i` must be updated to 2.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `i` is 2, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])` (for `diff` to be calculated in the next iteration).**
