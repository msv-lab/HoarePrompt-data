The value of `diff` is updated to be the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, we have `arr[i + 1]` as `arr[3]` and `arr[i]` as `arr[2]`. Hence, the new value of `diff` becomes `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The previous value of `diff` is not relevant since it is being overwritten. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `diff` is updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`.**
