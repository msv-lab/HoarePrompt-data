The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is already defined as `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The values of `arr`, `n`, `i`, and `diff` remain unchanged as a result of this assignment. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to `len(arr)`, `i` is 1, `diff` is updated to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
