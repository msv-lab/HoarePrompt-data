You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1
assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1
assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in arr such that n == len(arr).
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 since the value of n, which represents the number of elements in arr, is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in `arr`, such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 (n >= 2) and n == len(arr).
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to `len(arr)`, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`. If `n` is 2, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. If `n` is greater than 2, `min_diff` is the smallest difference found between all pairs of consecutive elements in the sorted list.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns min_diff, which is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr'. If 'n' is 2, min_diff is equal to arr[1] - arr[0]. If 'n' is greater than 2, min_diff is the smallest difference found between all pairs of consecutive elements in 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` representing the number of elements in `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. If `n` is 2, it returns the difference between the two elements in `arr`. If `n` is greater than 2, it returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. The function does not handle cases where `arr` may contain duplicate elements, as it will still calculate the minimum difference, which could be zero.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
