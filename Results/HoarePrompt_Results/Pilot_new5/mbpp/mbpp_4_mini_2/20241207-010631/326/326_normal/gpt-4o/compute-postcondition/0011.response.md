The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given that `i` is currently 1, this means `diff` will be updated to `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The previous value of `diff` was `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and `min_diff` will be compared with the new `diff`, but we do not have information on its previous value or whether it is updated.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to `len(arr)`, `i` is 1, `diff` is updated to `arr[2] - arr[1]`**.
