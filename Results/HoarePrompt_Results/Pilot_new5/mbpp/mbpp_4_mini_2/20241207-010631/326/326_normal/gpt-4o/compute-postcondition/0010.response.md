According to the code, the for loop iterates based on the value of `i`, which starts at 0 and goes up to `n - 2`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is equal to `len(arr)`, which means `n` is at least 2 since `arr` has at least 2 elements. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`, which implies that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to `len(arr)`, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `min_diff` must be updated if `diff` is less than the previous `min_diff` value.**
