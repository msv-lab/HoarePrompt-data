The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `diff` will now equal `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `target`, `min_diff`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])**
