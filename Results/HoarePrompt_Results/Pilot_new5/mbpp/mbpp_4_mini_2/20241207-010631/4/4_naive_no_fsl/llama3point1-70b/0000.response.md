Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to check whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. 

The logic behind the code is as follows:
1. It uses the XOR operator (`^`) to compare the two numbers. The result of `num1 ^ num2` will have bits set to `1` where `num1` and `num2` differ.
2. It then converts the result to binary using `bin()` and counts the number of `1`s in that binary representation using `count('1')`.
3. Finally, it checks if the count of `1`s is equal to `1`, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

To illustrate with examples:
- For `num1 = 2` (binary `10`) and `num2 = 3` (binary `11`), the XOR result is `1` (binary `01`), which has one `1`, so the output is `True`.
- For `num1 = 2` and `num2 = 4` (binary `100`), the XOR result is `6` (binary `110`), which has two `1`s, so the output is `False`.
- For `num1 = 5` (binary `101`) and `num2 = 7` (binary `111`), the XOR result is `2` (binary `10`), which has one `1`, so the output is `True`.

As we can see, the function correctly identifies whether the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position in all scenarios checked. Therefore, there are no cases where the function fails to meet the problem's requirements.
