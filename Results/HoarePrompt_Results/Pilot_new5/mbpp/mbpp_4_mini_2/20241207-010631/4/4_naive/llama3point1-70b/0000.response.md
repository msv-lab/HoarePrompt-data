Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The logic uses the XOR operator (`^`) which will produce a binary number where the bits are set to 1 only at the positions where the corresponding bits of the two numbers differ. The program then counts the number of 1's in the binary representation of the result using `bin(...).count('1')`. If this count is exactly 1, it indicates that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

For example:
- For inputs `num1 = 5` (binary `101`) and `num2 = 4` (binary `100`), the XOR will give `1` (binary `001`), which has exactly one `1`, so the output is `True`.
- For inputs `num1 = 5` (binary `101`) and `num2 = 6` (binary `110`), the XOR will give `3` (binary `011`), which has two `1's`, so the output is `False`.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases such as when both numbers are equal (the output will correctly be `False`), or when one of the numbers is zero. Thus, no counter-example can be found, confirming the correctness of the program.
