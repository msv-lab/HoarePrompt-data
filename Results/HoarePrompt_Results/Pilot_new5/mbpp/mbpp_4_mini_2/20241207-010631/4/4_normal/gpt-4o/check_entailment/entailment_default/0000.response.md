To determine the correctness of the provided Python function, let's analyze both the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This means that when we compare the binary representations of the two numbers, there should be exactly one position where the bits are different.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0
```

1. **XOR Operation**: The bitwise XOR operation (`^`) between two numbers results in a number where the bits are set to 1 only at positions where the corresponding bits of the two numbers differ.
2. **Power of Two Check**: The condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if `xor_result` is a power of two. If it is a power of two, then it means there is exactly one bit that is set to 1 (indicating a single differing bit position).

### Edge Cases
- The function does not explicitly handle the scenario where both `a` and `b` are zero. In that case, `xor_result` would be `0`, and the function would return `False`, which is correct since `0` does not differ from `0` at any bit position.
- If both `a` and `b` are the same positive integer, the function returns `False`, which is also correct.
- The function will return `True` for cases where `a` and `b` differ by exactly one bit.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function accepts two non-negative integers and checks if the XOR result is a power of two, thus confirming it has exactly one bit set. This aligns with the logic in the code.

### Conclusion
The code works correctly for all provided assertions and adheres to the problem description. It accurately identifies whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position and handles the edge cases appropriately.

Thus, there are no evident flaws or missing logic in the code based on the problem description and the output hints.

Correctness: **True**.
