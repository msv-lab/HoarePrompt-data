Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, calculates the XOR of these two numbers, and returns `True` if the result is a power of two (which means it is greater than zero and has exactly one bit set in its binary representation). If the XOR result is not a power of two, it returns `False`. **
