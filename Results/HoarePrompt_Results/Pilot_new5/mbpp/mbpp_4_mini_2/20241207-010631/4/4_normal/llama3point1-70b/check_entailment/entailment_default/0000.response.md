To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break down both the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description:
The program should check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The function computes the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`. The XOR operation results in a number where the bits are set to 1 only at the positions where the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.
2. It then converts the result of the XOR operation to its binary representation and counts the number of '1's.
3. If exactly one bit is set to 1 (indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position), the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

### Edge Cases:
- If `num1` and `num2` are the same, the XOR will be 0, and the count of '1's will be 0. This case is handled correctly by returning False.
- If `num1` and `num2` differ by more than one bit, the count of '1's will be greater than 1, and the function will return False.
- If `num1` and `num2` differ by exactly one bit, the count of '1's will be 1, and the function will return True. This is the primary case we want to check.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts two integers, and returns True if the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` has exactly one bit set to 1, indicating they differ by exactly one power of two. The hints also state that there are no additional edge cases or missing functionality in the implementation.

### Conclusion:
The output hints align with the implementation of the code. The code correctly identifies if two integers differ at exactly one bit position, which adheres to the problem description. Since it handles all the potential cases discussed and does not seem to miss any edge cases, we conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function works as expected for various inputs, including cases where the numbers are identical, differ by one bit, or differ by multiple bits. All necessary conditions outlined in the problem description are satisfied.
