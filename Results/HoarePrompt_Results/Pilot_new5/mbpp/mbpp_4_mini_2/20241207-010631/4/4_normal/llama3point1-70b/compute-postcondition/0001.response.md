The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `num1` and `num2`. Both `num1` and `num2` are integers. After executing the function body, if the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` has exactly one bit set to 1, the function returns `True`, indicating that `num1` and `num2` differ by exactly one power of two. If this condition is not met, the function returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `num1` and `num2`, and return `True` if they differ by exactly one power of two; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters num1 and num2, and returns True if the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one bit set to 1, indicating they differ by exactly one power of two; otherwise, it returns False.**
