#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0
    #The program returns whether xor_result is a power of two, as it checks if xor_result is not equal to 0 and if xor_result AND (xor_result - 1) is equal to 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, calculates the XOR of these two numbers, and returns `True` if the result is a power of two (which means it is greater than zero and has exactly one bit set in its binary representation). If the XOR result is not a power of two, it returns `False`.
