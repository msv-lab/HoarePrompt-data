To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and its behavior.

### Problem Description:
The function needs to check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only.

### Analyzing the Provided Program:
The function `func_1(a, b)` performs the following operations:
1. It computes the XOR of the two numbers `a` and `b` using `a ^ b`. The result, `xor_result`, will have bits set to `1` where the bits of `a` and `b` differ.
2. It checks if `xor_result` is not zero (i.e., the numbers differ at least at one position).
3. It checks if `xor_result` is a power of two using the condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`. This condition is true if and only if there is exactly one bit set in `xor_result`.

### Logical Flow:
- If `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position, the XOR of `a` and `b` will yield a number that is a power of two (e.g., `0001`, `0010`, `0100`, etc.).
- If they differ at zero positions (i.e., they are the same), `xor_result` will be `0`.
- If they differ at more than one bit position, `xor_result` will not be a power of two.
  
### Test Cases:
The assertions provided in the annotated program can be evaluated as follows:
- `func_1(13, 9)` should return `True`: 13 (1101) and 9 (1001) differ at one bit.
- `func_1(15, 8)` should return `False`: 15 (1111) and 8 (1000) differ at multiple bits.
- `func_1(2, 4)` should return `False`: 2 (0010) and 4 (0100) differ at multiple bits.
- `func_1(2, 3)` should return `True`: 2 (0010) and 3 (0011) differ at one bit.
- `func_1(5, 1)` should return `True`: 5 (0101) and 1 (0001) differ at one bit.
- `func_1(1, 5)` should return `True`: 1 (0001) and 5 (0101) differ at one bit.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at only one bit position. Therefore, it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
