Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input tuple has a length of 1 correctly. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to return a tuple of length N where each element is the product of consecutive elements in the input tuple. If the input tuple has only one element (for example `(12,)`), the expected output should be an empty tuple `()` since there are no pairs of elements to multiply. 

However, the assertion `assert func_1((12,)) == ()` is written before the function definition, and since it is executing the assertion before the function is defined, it does not properly validate that the function behaves correctly for this case.

Additionally, the function does not explicitly check for inputs with less than 2 elements (like an empty tuple or a single element tuple), which could lead to issues if such inputs are provided in a real-world scenario.

Thus, the program can fail for cases where the input tuple has fewer than 2 elements, leading to incorrect expectations as defined in the problem description.
