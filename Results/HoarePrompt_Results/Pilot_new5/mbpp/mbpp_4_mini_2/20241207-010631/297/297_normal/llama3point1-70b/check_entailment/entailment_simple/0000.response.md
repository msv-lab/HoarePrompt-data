The provided program takes a tuple of numbers with length \( N+1 \) and returns a tuple of length \( N \) where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. 

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a tuple of numerical values.
2. **Tuple Length**: The description states that the input tuple has a length of \( N+1 \). The program is designed to handle this by iterating through the tuple using `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, which effectively pairs each element with its next neighbor.
3. **Product Calculation**: For every pair of consecutive elements \( t_i \) and \( t_{i+1} \), the program calculates the product \( t_i * t_{i+1} \) using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor.
4. **Output**: The output of the function is a tuple containing \( N \) elements, which are the products of the \( N+1 \) elements from the input tuple.

The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description by producing the required output for any valid input tuple of length \( N+1 \).

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True** 

The program always follows the problem description because it accurately computes the products of each consecutive pair of elements from the input tuple, yielding the required output format.
