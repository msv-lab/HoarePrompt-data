Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `t` of numbers as input. The function computes a new tuple where each element at position `i` is the product of the elements at positions `i` and `i+1` in the input tuple.

This is achieved through a generator expression that iterates over the range of indices from `0` to `len(t) - 2` (inclusive), effectively covering all adjacent pairs in the tuple. The resulting products are collected into a new tuple using the `tuple()` constructor.

The assertions provided test various cases:
1. `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)` produces `(5, 35, 56, 80)` which corresponds to `1 * 5`, `5 * 7`, `7 * 8`, and `8 * 10`.
2. `(2, 4, 5, 6, 7)` gives `(8, 20, 30, 42)` for `2 * 4`, `4 * 5`, `5 * 6`, and `6 * 7`.
3. `(12, 13, 14, 9, 15)` results in `(156, 182, 126, 135)` for `12 * 13`, `13 * 14`, `14 * 9`, and `9 * 15`.
4. For the input tuple `(12,)`, which has only one element, it correctly returns an empty tuple `()` since there are no adjacent pairs to multiply.

The function handles the case of a tuple with only one element by returning an empty tuple, which is consistent with the requirement of returning a tuple of length `N` where `N` is the length of the input tuple minus one (in this case, 1 - 1 = 0).

Thus, the program meets all the conditions specified in the problem description and will work correctly for any valid input tuple with at least two elements.
