#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with at least two elements.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple of products of adjacent elements in the tuple 't'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `t` with at least two numerical elements and returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of adjacent elements in `t`. If `t` contains fewer than two elements, the function may not behave as expected, but the precondition states that `t` will always have at least two elements, so this is not a concern in valid usage.
