#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a tuple of numbers with length N+1, where each element can be any numerical type.
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of consecutive elements in the tuple 'numbers', where each element can be any numerical type and the length of 'numbers' is N+1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `numbers` of numerical types with length N+1 and returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of consecutive elements in the input tuple. If the input tuple has fewer than two elements, the function will return an empty tuple, as there would be no pairs to multiply.
