The function accepts a tuple `t` with at least two numerical elements and returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of adjacent elements in `t`. If `t` contains fewer than two elements, the function may not behave as expected, but the precondition states that `t` will always have at least two elements, so this is not a concern in valid usage.
