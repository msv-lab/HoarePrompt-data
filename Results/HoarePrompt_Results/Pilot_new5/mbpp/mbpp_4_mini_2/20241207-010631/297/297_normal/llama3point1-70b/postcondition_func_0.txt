The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `numbers` of numerical types with length N+1 and returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of consecutive elements in the input tuple. If the input tuple has fewer than two elements, the function will return an empty tuple, as there would be no pairs to multiply.
