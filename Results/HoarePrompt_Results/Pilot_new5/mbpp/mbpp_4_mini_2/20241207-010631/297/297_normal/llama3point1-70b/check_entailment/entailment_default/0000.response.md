The provided program aims to implement a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple containing the products of each pair of consecutive elements in the input tuple. Let's analyze it step by step.

### Program Analysis
The function `func_1` uses the `zip` function to pair consecutive elements from the input tuple `numbers` and then calculates the product of each pair with a generator expression. The result is then converted back to a tuple.

### Initial Assessment
1. **Input Requirements**: The program expects a tuple of length \(N+1\) (where \(N\) is at least 1 for there to be pairs to multiply) and will return a tuple of length \(N\).
2. **Edge Cases**: If the input tuple has fewer than two elements, the function, by the nature of `zip`, will return an empty tuple. This behavior correctly conforms to the requirement of returning an empty tuple when no pairs exist.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints state that:
- The function returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of consecutive elements in the input tuple.
- If the input tuple has fewer than two elements, it will return an empty tuple.

This agrees with the code, as the use of `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` will correctly iterate over pairs and the generator expression will compute their products.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and output hints, it is clear that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. The edge cases are handled correctly, including the situation where the input tuple length is less than 2.

Since I cannot identify any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
