The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. All three parameters are positive floats, where `base` represents the area of the triangular base, `height` represents the height of the triangular prism, and `length` represents the length of the prism. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is equal to 0.5 * base * height * length. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept three positive float parameters (base, height, and length) and return the volume of the triangular prism based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters base, height, and length, all of which are positive floats, and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as 0.5 * base * height * length.**
