Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the calculation of the volume of a triangular prism according to the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism is calculated using the formula \( V = A \cdot L \), where \( A \) is the area of the triangular base and \( L \) is the length of the prism. The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula \( A = 0.5 \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height} \).

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. 
   - It first calculates the area of the triangular base using `base_area = 0.5 * base * height`.
   - Then it computes the volume of the prism by multiplying the base area with the length: `volume = base_area * length`.
   - Finally, it returns the computed volume.

3. **Assertions as Tests**: The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases to validate the function's correctness:
   - For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`, the calculated volume would be \( 0.5 \cdot 10 \cdot 8 \cdot 6 = 240 \), which matches the assertion.
   - For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`, the calculated volume is \( 0.5 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 6 \), which also matches the assertion.
   - For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`, the calculated volume is \( 0.5 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 1 \), which again matches the assertion.

Since the function computes the volume of a triangular prism accurately and the assertions confirm it for multiple cases, the implementation adheres to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
