Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the provided problem description. 

Here's the breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts three positive numbers: `b`, `h`, and `l`. These represent the base length, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively, as stated in the problem description.

2. **Volume Calculation**: The volume of a triangular prism is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \left( \frac{\text{Base Length} \times \text{Height}}{2} \right) \times \text{Length}
   \]
   This matches the formula used in the function:
   \[
   \text{return } b * h / 2 * l
   \]

3. **Assumption of Positive Values**: The comments clearly state that the function assumes `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive numbers. Although there are no explicit checks for negative or zero values, the problem description and the function's annotations imply that the inputs will adhere to the condition of being positive.

Overall, the implementation adheres to the specification provided in the problem description and correctly computes the volume of a triangular prism based on the given parameters. Therefore, it is correct.
