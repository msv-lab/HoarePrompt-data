Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the provided problem description. The formula used in the function is accurate: the volume of a triangular prism is given by the area of the triangular base multiplied by the length of the prism. 

1. The area of a triangle is calculated as \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \), which is implemented in the function as \( b \times h / 2 \).
2. This area is then multiplied by the length \( l \) of the prism to compute the volume, resulting in the final expression \( \text{Volume} = \text{Area} \times l = \left( \frac{b \times h}{2} \right) \times l \).

Therefore, the function accurately implements the required calculation according to the problem description, and it will yield the correct volume for any positive values of base length \( b \), height \( h \), and length \( l \).
