The given program is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a string, which aligns with the problem description. However, the implementation is flawed and does not adhere to the requirements fully.

1. **Single Occurrence**: The program correctly handles the case where the character appears only once in the string. It uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove that single occurrence, which is correct.

2. **Multiple Occurrences**: In the case where the character appears multiple times, the program attempts to construct a new string using slicing to exclude the character at the `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` indices. However, the logic used is problematic:
   - The slicing logic `s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]` does not effectively remove the last occurrence of the character, as it will leave the character at the `last_occurrence` index still present in the string.

3. **Character Not Found**: The program returns the original string when the character is not found, which is correct behavior.

### Example Case:
For example, if the input string is `"hello world"` and the character is `'o'`:
- The expected output should be `"hell world"` (removing the first `'o'` and the last `'o'`).
- The program, however, would return `"hell world"` correctly, but it would not handle cases where the character occurs multiple times correctly beyond just the first and last occurrence due to the slicing logic.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to correctly remove both the first and last occurrences of the character in all scenarios (particularly when there are multiple occurrences of the character), it does not fully meet the problem description.

Thus, the final evaluation of the program's correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
