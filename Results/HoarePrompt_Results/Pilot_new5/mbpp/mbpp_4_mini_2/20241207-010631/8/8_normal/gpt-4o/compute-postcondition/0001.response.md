The variable `last_index` is assigned the value of the last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s` using the `rfind` method. The variable `first_index` remains unchanged and continues to hold the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
