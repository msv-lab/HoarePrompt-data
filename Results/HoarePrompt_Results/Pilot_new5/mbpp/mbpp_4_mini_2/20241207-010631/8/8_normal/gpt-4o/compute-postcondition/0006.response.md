The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `ch`, which is a single character string. If `ch` is not found in `s` or if the first and last occurrences of `ch` are the same, the function returns the string `s`. If `ch` is found in `s` and the first and last occurrences are different, the function returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `ch` removed and the last occurrence of `ch` removed, while preserving the characters in between. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and based on the occurrences of `ch` in `s`, either return the original string or return a modified version with specific characters removed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `s` (a string) and `ch` (a single character string), returning `s` if `ch` is not found or if its first and last occurrences are the same; otherwise, it returns `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.**
