Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the problem description. The function is supposed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. However, the implementation can lead to incorrect results in some cases:

1. If the character `ch` occurs only once in the string, the program correctly returns the string without that character. However, it does not handle the case where the character is the same for both first and last occurrence correctly because it simply returns the string `s` in that case.

2. If the character `ch` appears multiple times, while the function removes the first and last occurrence as expected, it does not handle situations where `first_index` and `last_index` are the same. In such cases, the character should be entirely removed, but it instead returns the string unchanged.

For example:
- `func_1('hello', 'l')` correctly returns `'heo'`.
- `func_1('abcda', 'a')` correctly returns `'bcd'`.
- However, `func_1('P', 'P')` would return `'P'`, which is incorrect as it should return an empty string.

Thus, the implementation has logical flaws that prevent it from adhering to the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.
