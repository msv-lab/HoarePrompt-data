The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `char`. Parameter `s` is a string, and parameter `char` is a single character. The function produces different outputs based on the occurrences of `char` in `s`:

- Case 1: If `char` appears only once in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed.
- Case 2: If `char` appears multiple times in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with all occurrences of `char` removed, where the first and last occurrences are identified.
- Case 3: If `char` is not present in `s`, the function returns the string `s` unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `char`, and return a modified version of `s` based on the occurrences of `char` in it. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`, returning `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed if it appears once, all occurrences of `char` removed if it appears multiple times, or returning `s` unchanged if `char` is not present.**
