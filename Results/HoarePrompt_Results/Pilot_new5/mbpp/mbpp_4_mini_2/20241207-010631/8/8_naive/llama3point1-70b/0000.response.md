To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function step by step.

**Problem description**: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

### Analysis
1. **Finding Occurrences**: The program correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the specified character using `s.find(char)` and `s.rfind(char)`.

2. **Removing Characters**:
   - If both occurrences are found and they are the same, it removes that character once using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, which is correct.
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, it constructs a new string that omits the first and last occurrences. This part uses string slicing and concatenation which seems to work correctly at first glance.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the character is not present in the string (both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` will be -1), the function correctly returns the original string.
   - However, there is a potential issue when the string consists of just two characters that are the same, for example `s = "aa"` and `char = "a"`. In this case, the first and last occurrences are the same, and `s.replace(char, '', 1)` would return `"a"` instead of removing both occurrences. 

### Example Case
- For input `func_1("aa", "a")`, the expected output is `""` (an empty string) because both occurrences of `a` should be removed. However, the program returns `"a"`.

### Conclusion
The function will fail for cases where the string consists of only two identical characters, as it does not handle the complete removal of those characters. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
