Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the character to be removed does not appear more than once in the string. For instance, if we test the input `func_1('a', 'a')`, the function should return an empty string since both the first and last occurrence of 'a' should be removed. However, in this case, it returns the original string 'a' because the condition `first_index == last_index` will evaluate to `True` and it will return `s` instead of removing the character.

Thus, the function does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case.
