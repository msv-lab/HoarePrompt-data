To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and ensure it meets the requirements of removing the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string for all potential cases.

The function works as follows:
1. It finds the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` using `s.find(ch)`.
2. It finds the index of the last occurrence of the character `ch` using `s.rfind(ch)`.
3. If either the first or last index is not found (i.e., `-1`), or if they are the same (meaning there's only one occurrence of `ch`), it returns the original string `s`.
4. If there are at least two occurrences, it constructs a new string by omitting the characters at the first and last indices.

Let's consider some potential edge cases:
- If the string is empty, `func_1('', 'a')` should return `''` since there are no characters to remove.
- If the character does not exist in the string, `func_1('test', 'x')` should return `'test'` since no removal is needed.
- If the character appears only once, such as `func_1('hello', 'h')`, it should return `'hello'` as there's no second occurrence to remove.

Now, let's check the above edge cases with the provided function:
1. `func_1('', 'a')` returns `''` (correct).
2. `func_1('test', 'x')` returns `'test'` (correct).
3. `func_1('hello', 'h')` returns `'hello'` (correct).

Now, let's test a case where the character appears only twice. For example, `func_1('abcabc', 'a')`, we expect it to return `'bc'` (removing both 'a's). However, the current implementation would return `'bc'`, which is correct.

One critical test case to consider is if the string consists solely of the character to be removed. For instance, `func_1('aaa', 'a')` will return an empty string `''` because it will find the first and last occurrence both at index `0` and would end up removing all the characters. The expected behavior needs clarification in this case. If the requirement is to remove both the first and last occurrence, it should return an empty string. 

Thus, upon analysis, the program performs correctly for all tested cases, including edge cases. There are no found scenarios where it behaves incorrectly based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
