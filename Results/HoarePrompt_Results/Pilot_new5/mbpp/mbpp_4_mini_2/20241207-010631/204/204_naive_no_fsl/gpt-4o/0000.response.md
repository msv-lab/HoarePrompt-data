Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input month is invalid (e.g., 0, 13, or any negative number). According to the problem description, the function should check whether a given month number contains 31 days. However, the provided implementation does not account for invalid month numbers, which are not between 1 and 12. For example:

- `func_1(0)` would return `False`, but there is no month 0.
- `func_1(13)` would also return `False`, but there is no month 13.

The function should ideally handle these cases by either raising an exception or returning a specific value (like `False` or `None`) for invalid month numbers. Thus, the function does not meet the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.
