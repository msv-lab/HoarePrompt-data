Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the given month number (an integer between 1 and 12) corresponds to a month that contains 31 days. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem states that the input (`month`) is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive. The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` which contains the integers representing months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). 

2. **Logic Implementation**: The function uses the expression `month in months_with_31_days` to determine if the input month is one of the months with 31 days. This is an appropriate and efficient way to check membership in a predefined set of values.

3. **Expected Outputs**: The program includes assertions to validate the outputs for different months:
   - Months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) return `True`.
   - Months without 31 days (2, 4, 6, 9, 11) return `False`.
   The assertions provided correspond correctly to the expected outputs as per the problem description.

Thus, the function behaves as expected across all specified inputs, confirming that it satisfies the problem's requirements.
