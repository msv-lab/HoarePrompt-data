The provided program checks whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) has 31 days. The function uses a set containing the month numbers that have 31 days and checks if the given month is in that set.

1. **Initial Assessment**: 
   - For months with 31 days, the months are: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The months with fewer days (or exactly 28/29 days) are February (2) and April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).
   - The function correctly identifies whether a month has 31 days by returning `True` for the months in the set and `False` otherwise.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The function assumes that the input will always be a valid month between 1 and 12. If an invalid month (like 0 or 13) is submitted, the function would incorrectly return `False` without raising an error, which might not be desirable behavior.

3. **Output Hints**: 
   - The output hints state that the function accepts an integer representing a month and returns `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise. This aligns with the function's design and its logic.

4. **Conclusion**: 
   - While the function works correctly for valid inputs (months 1 to 12), it does not handle invalid inputs (0 or 13) properly. Since the problem description does not specify that the input must be strictly between 1 and 12, the function could return unexpected results for these cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle edge cases where the month number is outside the valid range (1-12), which could lead to incorrect outputs. For example, calling `func_1(0)` would return `False`, but this doesn't represent any valid month, leading to an unexpected behavior.
