#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the month number, where 1 <= n <= 12.
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the integer n (representing the month number) is in the list of months with 31 days, which includes the months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the month number and returns `True` if `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12); otherwise, it returns `False`. It assumes `n` is between 1 and 12, inclusive, but does not handle cases where `n` is outside this range.
