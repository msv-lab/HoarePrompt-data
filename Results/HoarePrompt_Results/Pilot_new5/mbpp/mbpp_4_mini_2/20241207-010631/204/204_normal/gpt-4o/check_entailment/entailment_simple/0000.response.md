Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number (an integer between 1 and 12) corresponds to a month that has 31 days. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Range**: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` which is stated to be between 1 and 12, inclusive. This matches the expected input for months of the year.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` that contains the integers representing the months with 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

3. **Return Value**: The function checks if the input `month` is in the set of months with 31 days. It returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. This behavior directly corresponds to the requirement of checking whether a given month has 31 days.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions check various months and their results:
   - `func_1(5)` returns `True` (May has 31 days).
   - `func_1(2)` returns `False` (February does not have 31 days).
   - `func_1(6)` returns `False` (June does not have 31 days).
   - `func_1(1)` returns `True` (January has 31 days).
   - `func_1(12)` returns `True` (December has 31 days).
   - `func_1(11)` returns `False` (November does not have 31 days).

All tests align with the expected outcomes as per the problem description. Thus, the program correctly implements the specified functionality of checking whether a month has 31 days.
