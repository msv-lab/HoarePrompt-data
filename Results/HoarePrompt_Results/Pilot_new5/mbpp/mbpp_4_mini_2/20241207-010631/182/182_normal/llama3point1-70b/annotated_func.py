#State of the program right berfore the function call: strings is a tuple containing strings.
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
    #The program returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple 'strings'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `strings` containing strings and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, it will result in an `IndexError` since the code does not handle the case of accessing the last character of an empty string. Therefore, edge cases include scenarios where the strings in the tuple may be empty.
