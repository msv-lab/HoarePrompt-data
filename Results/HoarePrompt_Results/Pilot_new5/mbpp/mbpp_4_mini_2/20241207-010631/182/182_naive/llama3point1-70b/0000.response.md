Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where an empty string is included in the tuple. If an empty string is present, accessing `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError`. For example, if the input is `("", "hello", "world")`, the function will throw an error when it attempts to access the last character of the empty string. Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
