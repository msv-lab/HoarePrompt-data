To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, we will analyze the program step by step.

**Problem Description:** 
The program is supposed to check if the frequency of each digit in a non-negative integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

**Program Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1(n)` converts the integer `n` into a string to iterate over its digits.
2. It counts the frequency of each digit using a dictionary.
3. It then checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit.
4. If any digit's frequency exceeds its value, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

**Initial Assessment:**
- The code appears to be correctly checking the conditions described in the problem statement for non-negative integers. 
- However, the problem description specifically mentions that the function should handle "non-negative integers," yet there is no explicit handling for negative integers as stated in the output hints. The function will raise an error if a negative integer is passed, as it tries to convert the negative number into a string. 

**Output Hints:**
- The output hints clarify that the function accepts a non-negative integer and calculates the frequency of each digit, returning `True` if each frequency is less than or equal to the digit itself. 
- The hints also indicate that negative integers or non-integer types aren't considered, implying that the function does not account for these inputs.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. **Negative Integers:** If `n` is negative (e.g., `-123`), the function will fail since it tries to convert it to a string.
2. **Non-integer Types:** If `n` is not an integer (e.g., a string like `'123'` or a float like `123.45`), the function will also raise an error.
3. **Zero:** The function handles `0` correctly since the frequency of `0` is implicitly `0` and thus meets the condition.

**Conclusion:**
Since the program does not handle negative integers or non-integer types and will raise errors on such cases, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**.
