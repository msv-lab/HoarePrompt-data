Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **String Conversion**: The integer `n` is converted to its string representation `str_n`, allowing for easy iteration over each digit.

3. **Digit Frequency Check**: The program uses a loop to iterate through each digit in `str_n`. For each digit, it counts how many times that digit appears in the string using `str_n.count(digit)`.

4. **Comparison Logic**: The program checks if the count of the current digit is greater than the integer value of that digit (`int(digit)`). If the count exceeds the digit's value, the function returns `False`, indicating that the condition specified in the problem description is violated.

5. **Valid State Return**: If the loop completes without finding any digit that occurs more frequently than its value, the function returns `True`, confirming that the condition is satisfied for all digits.

The program thus correctly checks the frequency of each digit in the integer against its value, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. There are no edge cases or potential inputs under the constraints given (non-negative integers) that would cause the function to behave incorrectly.
