To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

**Problem description:** The task is to check whether the frequency of each digit in a non-negative integer \( n \) is less than or equal to the digit itself.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a non-negative integer \( n \) and returns `False` if any digit in its string representation appears more times than its integer value; otherwise, it returns `True`. It will also return `True` for the case when \( n \) is 0.

**Initial assessment of the code:**
- The code converts the integer \( n \) to a string to analyze the frequency of each digit.
- It counts the occurrences of each digit in the string representation and checks if that count exceeds the integer value of the digit.
- If it finds any digit that appears more times than its value, it returns `False`. If all checks pass, it returns `True`.

**Potential edge cases:**
1. **Single-digit numbers**: For example, `n = 5`, the digit '5' should occur at most 5 times, which is fine since it cannot occur more than once.
2. **Number with multiple digits**: For example, `n = 122`, where the digit '2' appears twice. This is valid since 2 is the integer value of the digit.
3. **Leading zeros**: This case should not apply, as the input is a non-negative integer and cannot have leading zeros.
4. **Zero**: The program should correctly return `True` for `n = 0`, as there are no digits to count.
5. **Larger numbers with high frequency of digits**: For example, `n = 11122` should return `False` since '1' occurs three times but its integer value is 1.

**Output hint validation:**
- The output hints mention that the function will return `True` for the case when \( n \) is 0, which is expected and aligns with the code.
- The hint also states that the function will return `False` if any digit in \( n \) appears more times than its integer value, which is the core functionality of the function.

**Finding a case that does not work correctly:**
Upon reviewing the code, there is a critical flaw. The code does not handle cases where a digit's frequency is equal to its value correctly. For instance:
- For `n = 222`, the digit '2' occurs three times, which violates the condition that its frequency should be less than or equal to the digit's value (2). The function would return `True` instead of `False` because it only checks for strictly greater frequency.

Thus, since there are examples where the function does not behave as expected based on the problem definition, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to return the correct result for cases where a digit's frequency exceeds its value, such as `n = 222`.
