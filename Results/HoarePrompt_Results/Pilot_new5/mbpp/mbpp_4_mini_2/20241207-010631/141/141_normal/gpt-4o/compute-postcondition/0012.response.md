According to the code, the loop iterates through each character in `digit_str`. The loop can execute again if `digit_str` contains more characters to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `digit_str` has at least 2 characters, and `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`. If `digit_str` has at least 3 characters, then the next iteration will process the third character of `digit_str`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `digit_str` has at least 3 characters. After the current iteration, the next `digit` will be the third character of `digit_str`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n` with at least 3 characters, and `digit` is the third character of `digit_str`.**
