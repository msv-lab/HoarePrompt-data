Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` has at least two items remaining, `count` is the count for the next digit, and `digit` is the next digit in the frequency items. If `count` is greater than `digit`, the function returns False; otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
