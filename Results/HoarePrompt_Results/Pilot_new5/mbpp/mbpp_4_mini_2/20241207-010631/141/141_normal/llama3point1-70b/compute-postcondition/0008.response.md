According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string representation `str_n`. The loop will iterate over each character in `str_n`. At the end of the last iteration, `str_n` has at least 2 characters, since it is stated that `str_n` has at least 2 characters. If the loop has already executed for the first character, we can deduce that the loop has processed one character and is currently at the second character.

Since `str_n` has at least 2 characters, for the loop to execute one more time, it must have at least 3 characters in total. After processing the second character, the loop will move to the third character.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and `str_n` is a string representation of `n` with at least 3 characters.**
