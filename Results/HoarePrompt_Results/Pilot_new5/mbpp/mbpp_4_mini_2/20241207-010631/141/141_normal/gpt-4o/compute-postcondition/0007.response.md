Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `frequency` is a dictionary that either increments the count of `digit` by 1 if `digit` is already a key in `frequency`, or adds `digit` as a key with the value 1 if it was not present. Here, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`.***
