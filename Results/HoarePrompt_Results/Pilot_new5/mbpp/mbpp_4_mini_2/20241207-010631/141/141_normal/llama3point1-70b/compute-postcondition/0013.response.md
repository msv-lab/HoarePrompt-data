The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. Regardless of the conditions, the function will return `False` for Cases 1, 2, and 3. In Case 4, if the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `False` for most cases, while returning `True` only if the digit count condition is satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns `False` unless the count of each digit in the string representation of n is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit, in which case it returns `True`.**
