`frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. Given that `digit` is the third character of `digit_str`, which is a string representation of `n`, `digit` will be a character representing a digit. The state of `n`, `digit_str`, and `digit` remains unchanged, but `frequency[digit]` is updated. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character of `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1.**
