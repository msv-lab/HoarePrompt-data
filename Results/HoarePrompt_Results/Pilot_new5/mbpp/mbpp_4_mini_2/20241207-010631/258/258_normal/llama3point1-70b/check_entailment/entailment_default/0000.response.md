The provided program checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a number with `n` digits is an integer such that the sum of its digits raised to the power of `n` equals the number itself.

The code provided is as follows:

```python
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

The function correctly converts the number to a string to analyze its digits, calculates the power based on the number of digits, and compares the sum of the powered digits to the original number to determine if it is an Armstrong number. 

### Initial Assessment
- The code works for non-negative integers as described. 
- It raises each digit to the power of the number of digits and sums them up, checking if this sum equals the original number.
- However, the code does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, which are not covered by the problem description but could lead to errors or incorrect results.

### Output Hints Review
The output hints state:
- The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns True if `num` is an Armstrong number.
- It also notes that it does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs and assumes `num` is always a non-negative integer.

### Conclusion
The program is indeed designed to check for Armstrong numbers and functions correctly for all non-negative integer inputs. However, since it does not explicitly handle negative integers (even though they are not specified in the description), this could be considered an edge case that is not managed. If negative integers were provided, the function would not work as intended.

Thus, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically handling negative numbers):

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Incorrectness
If we input a negative number, such as `-153`, the function will still return `False`, since the concept of an Armstrong number does not apply to negative numbers, and the problem description does not cover this. However, since the code does not error out or handle it, it is a valid point of failure in scenarios outside the expected input range.
