The code calculates `armstrong_sum` by summing the result of raising each digit of `n` (represented as a string in `num_str`) to the power of `num_len`, which is the number of digits in `n`. The variable `armstrong_sum` is therefore updated to be the sum of these calculations.

- `num_str` represents `n` as a string, so it contains the digits of `n` in string format.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, which corresponds to the length of `num_str`.

Since `n` is a non-negative integer, and both `num_str` and `num_len` are derived from `n`, `armstrong_sum` can be computed as follows:

- For each digit in `num_str`, convert it to an integer, raise it to the power of `num_len`, and summarize all these values to get `armstrong_sum`.

The output state reflects that `armstrong_sum` now holds the computed value based on the digits of `n` raised to the power of `num_len`, while all other variables retain their previous state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, `armstrong_sum` is the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
