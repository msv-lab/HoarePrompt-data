The code increments `sum` by the value of `int(digit) ** num_len`. Given the initial state, `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a non-empty string, and `num_len` equals the length of `num_str`. The specific value of `digit` is not provided, but it must be a character from `num_str` since it is being converted to an integer. 

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `sum`, which will be `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a non-empty string, `num_len` must equal the length of `num_str`, `sum` is equal to 0 plus `int(digit) ** num_len**.**
