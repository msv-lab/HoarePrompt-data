`num_len` is assigned the value of `len(num_str)`, which calculates the length of the string representation of `num`. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` accurately reflects its value as a string. The length of `num_str` depends on the number of digits in `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.**
