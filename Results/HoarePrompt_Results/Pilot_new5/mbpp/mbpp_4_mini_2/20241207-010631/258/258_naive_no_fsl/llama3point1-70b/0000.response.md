Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the Armstrong number check as described in the problem statement. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function `func_1(num)` works as follows:
1. Converts the input number to a string to iterate over its digits.
2. Calculates the number of digits in the number.
3. Computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Finally, it checks if this computed sum is equal to the original number and returns `True` or `False`.

I cannot find any case where the program would fail to correctly identify an Armstrong number based on the logic provided. The function handles single-digit numbers (which are always Armstrong numbers) and multi-digit numbers correctly.

Examples:
- For `num = 153`, the calculation would be \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\), thus returning `True`.
- For `num = 9474`, the calculation would be \(9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 9474\), thus returning `True`.
- For `num = 123`, the calculation would be \(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36\), thus returning `False`.

Since the program handles all potential cases of Armstrong numbers correctly, I conclude that the program is correct.
