Correctness: **False**.

The provided program aims to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. However, there is an issue with the condition used in the while loop. The condition checks if the length of the triangular number is greater than or equal to n, and returns the index when this condition is met. 

This leads to an incorrect result in cases where the triangular number has more than n digits. For instance, for an input of `n = 3`, the triangular numbers are:
- T1 = 1 (1 digit)
- T2 = 3 (1 digit)
- T3 = 6 (1 digit)
- T4 = 10 (2 digits)
- T5 = 15 (2 digits)
- T6 = 21 (2 digits)
- T7 = 28 (2 digits)
- T8 = 36 (2 digits)
- T9 = 45 (2 digits)
- T10 = 55 (2 digits)
- T11 = 66 (2 digits)
- T12 = 78 (2 digits)
- T13 = 91 (2 digits)
- T14 = 105 (3 digits)

In this case, the function would return `14` for input `n = 3`, which is correct, but if we tested `n = 4`, it would return `14` again as T14 = 105 (which has 3 digits) meets the condition of "greater than or equal to" 4 digits. The smallest triangular number with 4 digits is T35 = 630, so the expected return value should be `35`.

Thus, since the program does not handle this case correctly, it is incorrect.
