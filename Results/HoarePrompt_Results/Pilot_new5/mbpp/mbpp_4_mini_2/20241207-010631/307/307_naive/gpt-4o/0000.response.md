To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the code and see if it correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

The problem description indicates that we need to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits. A triangular number is calculated using the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).

Now, let's analyze the function `func_1(n)`:

1. We start with `k = 1`.
2. We compute the triangular number \( T_k \) using the formula.
3. We check the length of the string representation of the triangular number to see if it has `n` digits.
4. If it does, we return the current value of `k`.
5. If it does not, we increment `k` and repeat the process.

Now, letâ€™s analyze the provided assertions:
- `func_1(2) == 4`: This is correct, as the first triangular number with 2 digits is 10 (which is the 4th triangular number).
- `func_1(3) == 14`: This is correct, as the first triangular number with 3 digits is 105 (which is the 14th triangular number).
- `func_1(4) == 45`: This is correct, as the first triangular number with 4 digits is 1035 (which is the 45th triangular number).

The program seems to be correctly returning the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits for the provided test cases. 

However, let's consider edge cases:
- If `n = 1`, the smallest triangular number with 1 digit is 1 (which is the 1st triangular number). The program should return 1 in this case.
- If `n = 5`, the smallest triangular number with 5 digits is 10010 (which is the 141st triangular number). The program should return 141.

Since the program does not have explicit tests for cases like `n = 1` or `n = 5`, we should consider if it can accurately handle such inputs.

After careful examination:
- For `n = 1`, it will correctly find the triangular number 1 and return 1.
- For `n = 5`, it will eventually find the triangular number 10010 but return the correct index as well.

Therefore, the program handles these cases correctly.

Since I could not find any input where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits for all inputs tested and potential edge cases.
