The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Initially, `k` is 2, so after the increment, `k` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The function does not return any value in this case, as the provided code snippet does not include a return statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is now 3, and `triangular_number` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3.**
