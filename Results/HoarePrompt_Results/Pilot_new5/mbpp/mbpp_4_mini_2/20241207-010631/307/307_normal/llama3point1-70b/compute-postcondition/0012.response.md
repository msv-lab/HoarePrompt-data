Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless an external condition (like a break statement) is encountered. Thus, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `triangular_num` is 3, `idx` is 3**
