The code assigns `triangular_num` the value calculated by the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Here, `idx` is currently 3, so we perform the calculation: 

```
triangular_num = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2
               = 3 * 4 // 2
               = 12 // 2
               = 6
```

The value of `triangular_num` is updated from 3 to 6. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `triangular_num` while retaining the values of `n` and `idx`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `triangular_num` is 6, `idx` is 3**
