The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the triangular number corresponding to `idx` has at least `n` digits. The function continues to compute triangular numbers until it finds one that meets this criterion. It does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, which may lead to an infinite loop if such values are passed.
