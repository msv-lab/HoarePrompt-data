The value of `triangular_number` is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 2, the calculation becomes `2 * (2 + 1) // 2`, which evaluates to `3`. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` (which is now `3`) is still not equal to `n`, since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `triangular_number`, while the other conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
