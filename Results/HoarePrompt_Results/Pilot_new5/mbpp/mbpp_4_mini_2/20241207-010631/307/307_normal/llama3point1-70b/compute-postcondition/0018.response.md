The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number. After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on conditions:

- In Case_1, the function returns `idx` which is 1, indicating the current index of the triangular number that has at least 'n' digits.
- In Case_2, the function returns `idx` which is equal to 2.
- In Case_3, the function returns the value of `idx` which is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the index of the triangular number that meets the condition of having at least `n` digits, with specific return values for different cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer, and returns the index of the triangular number with at least n digits, with possible return values of 1, 2, or 3 based on different conditions.**
