Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description accurately. The issue arises from the handling of the input value `n`. The problem description specifies that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, which can lead to an infinite loop if such values are passed. 

Here are the specific points of failure:

1. **Lack of Input Validation**: The function does not perform any validation on the input `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the while loop will continue indefinitely because the condition to exit the loop (finding a triangular number with at least `n` digits) will never be satisfied. 

2. **Infinite Loop Risk**: If a negative number or zero is passed as `n`, the function will not return any value, leading to an infinite loop, which is inappropriate given the requirements of the problem. 

Thus, the function's inability to handle invalid input cases correctly indicates that it does not fully adhere to the requirements specified in the problem description.
