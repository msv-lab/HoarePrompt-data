Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to run indefinitely unless there is a break condition inside the loop. Therefore, it will certainly execute one time regardless of the values of `n` and `idx`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 1**
