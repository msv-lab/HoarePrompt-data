According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely unless there is a break condition present in the loop body. Since there is no condition that would prevent the loop from executing, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute at least once.

Thus, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 1**
