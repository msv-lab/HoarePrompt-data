In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute again regardless of the current state variables. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
