Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters, list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted list containing all integers from these lists combined. It does not handle any specific edge cases regarding empty lists or non-integer elements within the lists, but it will return a sorted result regardless of the lists' content as long as they contain integers.**
