Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists of integers into a single sorted list. 

Here's why it meets the problem description:
- The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are all specified to be lists of integers.
- It combines these lists using the `+` operator, which concatenates the three lists into one.
- It then applies the `sorted()` function to the concatenated list, ensuring that the resulting list is sorted in ascending order.
- The function returns this sorted list.

The program handles all potential cases of merging three integer lists. If any of the lists are empty, the concatenation will still yield a valid result (the non-empty lists will be combined and sorted), and since it is stated that the lists are supposed to contain integers, there are no concerns regarding non-integer elements. 

Overall, the function adheres to the requirements of the problem description by merging and sorting the provided lists of integers.
