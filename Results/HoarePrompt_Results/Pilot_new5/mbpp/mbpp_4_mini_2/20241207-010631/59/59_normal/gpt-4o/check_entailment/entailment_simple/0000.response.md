Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes three lists as input (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`). This aligns with the requirement to merge three lists.

2. **Merging**: Inside the function, it combines the three lists using the expression `list1 + list2 + list3`. This operation correctly merges the lists into a single list.

3. **Sorting**: The merged list is then sorted using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which produces a new list that is sorted in ascending order. This meets the requirement of returning a sorted list of all the elements from the three input lists.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the sorted list, which is exactly what the problem description requires - a single sorted list containing all the elements from the three input lists.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input scenarios, ensuring that it produces the expected sorted output.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and handles the merging and sorting of three lists correctly, which confirms its correctness.
