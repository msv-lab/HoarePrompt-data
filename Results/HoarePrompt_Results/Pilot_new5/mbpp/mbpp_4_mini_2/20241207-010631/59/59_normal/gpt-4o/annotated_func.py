#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists containing elements that can be compared to each other, and the output will be a single sorted list containing all the elements from these three lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #The program returns the sorted version of the combined list, which contains all elements from list1, list2, and list3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three lists, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, and returns a single sorted list that contains all elements from these three lists combined. It does not handle cases where the lists might contain mixed data types that cannot be compared with each other, which could lead to a TypeError during sorting.
