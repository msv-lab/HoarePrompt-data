Correctness: **False**

The program does not always meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to merge three lists and return a single sorted list, which it does correctly for the provided test cases. However, the function does not handle cases where the lists might contain mixed data types (e.g., integers and strings), which could lead to a `TypeError` during sorting.

For example, if we call the function with the following lists:

```python
func_1([1, 2], ['a', 'b'], [3, 4])
```

This would raise a `TypeError` because Python cannot compare integers with strings.

Thus, while the function works well for the provided test cases, it fails to adhere to the problem description's requirement to handle all potential inputs that might be provided. Hence, it is not correctly implemented for every case, leading to the conclusion that the program does not fulfill the problem description entirely.
