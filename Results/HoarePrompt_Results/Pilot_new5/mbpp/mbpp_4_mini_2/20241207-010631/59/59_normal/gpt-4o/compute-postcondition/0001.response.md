The `sorted_list` is assigned the value of `sorted(combined_list)`, which sorts all elements from `combined_list`. The original lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` remain unchanged, but `combined_list` contains all elements from them. Therefore, `sorted_list` will be the sorted version of `combined_list`, which is a combination of the elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.

Output State: **`list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists containing elements that can be compared to each other; `combined_list` is a list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`; `sorted_list` is the sorted version of `combined_list`.**
