The variable `combined_list` is assigned the value of the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Therefore, `combined_list` becomes a single list containing all the elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. The states of the other variables (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists containing elements that can be compared to each other; `combined_list` is a list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.**
