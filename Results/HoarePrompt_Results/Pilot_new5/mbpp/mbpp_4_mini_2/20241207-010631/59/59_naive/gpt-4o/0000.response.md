Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list, and then sorts that combined list. The provided assertions test the function with different combinations of lists, and all assertions hold true, indicating that the function behaves as expected for the given cases. Since there are no edge cases or potential issues identified, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
