Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It accomplishes this by concatenating the three input lists and then using the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the combined list. This approach will work for any valid input, including cases where the input lists are empty, contain negative numbers, or are already sorted. Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.
