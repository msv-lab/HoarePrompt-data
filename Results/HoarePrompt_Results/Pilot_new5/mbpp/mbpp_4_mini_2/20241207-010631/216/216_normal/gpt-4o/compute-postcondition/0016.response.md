The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. If `lst` is empty, the function returns `False`, indicating that there are no integers present. If the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted list `lst_sorted` is not equal to 1, the function also returns `False`. Additionally, there are other cases where the function returns `False`. Finally, if the list `lst_sorted` contains at least 2 consecutive integers, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `True` if the list contains at least 2 consecutive integers; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns True if lst contains at least 2 consecutive integers; otherwise, it returns False.**
