According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 integers. For the loop to be executed one more time, the length of `lst_sorted` must remain at least 2, and `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The condition regarding the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` being equal to 1 will still hold true for the next iteration.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1, and the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is equal to 1.**
