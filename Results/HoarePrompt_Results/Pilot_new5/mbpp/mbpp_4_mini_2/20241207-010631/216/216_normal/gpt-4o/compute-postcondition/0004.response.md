To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved, particularly `lst_sorted`. The for loop will iterate using the range from 0 to `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. 

1. For the loop to have any iterations, `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than 1. This implies that `lst_sorted` should contain at least 2 elements.
2. At the end of the last iteration of the loop, the variable `i` will hold the value of `len(lst_sorted) - 2`.

Given these considerations, the final state should reflect that `lst_sorted` has at least 2 integers and indicates the starting values for `i`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 0**
