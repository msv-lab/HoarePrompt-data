#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, as the list 'lst' is empty, indicating that there are no integers present.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers that must contain at least 2 integers, the difference between each consecutive pair of integers in `lst_sorted` is equal to 1, indicating that all integers in `lst_sorted` are consecutive.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list 'lst_sorted' is valid as it contains at least 2 consecutive integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns False if the list is empty or if the sorted list does not contain at least two consecutive integers. If the sorted list contains at least two consecutive integers, it returns True. However, it does not check for lists with fewer than two elements; hence, if `lst` has only one element, it also returns False, which is an implicit edge case not stated in the annotations.
