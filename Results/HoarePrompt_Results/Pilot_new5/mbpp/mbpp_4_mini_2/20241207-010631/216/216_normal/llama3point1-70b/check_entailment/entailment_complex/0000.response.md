Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Consecutive Numbers Check**: The function first sorts the list of integers. By doing so, it ensures that any consecutive numbers will be adjacent in the sorted order. The program then checks whether every element in the sorted list differs from its preceding element by exactly 1. This is done using the expression `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))`, which iterates through the list and verifies the condition for each pair of consecutive elements.

2. **No Duplicates**: The second part of the condition checks if the length of the original list is equal to the length of the set created from that list (`len(lst) == len(set(lst))`). This ensures that there are no duplicate numbers in the list since a set only contains unique elements.

3. **Empty List Handling**: The program correctly handles the case of an empty list. An empty list will result in the condition checking for consecutive elements to be vacuously true, but since `len(lst)` would be 0, the check for duplicates will also hold true, effectively returning `False`, which is consistent with the requirement that an empty list does not contain consecutive numbers.

By addressing all these points, the function adheres to the problem description of determining whether a list contains consecutive numbers without duplicates. Thus, the implementation is correct and fulfills the specified requirements.
