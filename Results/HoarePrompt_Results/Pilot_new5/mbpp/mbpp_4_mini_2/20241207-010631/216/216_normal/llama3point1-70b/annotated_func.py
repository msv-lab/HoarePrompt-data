#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if all consecutive elements in the sorted list 'lst' differ by 1 and if the length of 'lst' is equal to the length of the set of 'lst', indicating there are no duplicate elements; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if the sorted list contains consecutive integers (each differing by exactly 1) without any duplicates. If the list is empty or contains duplicates, or if the integers are not consecutive, it returns `False`.
