The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, if all consecutive elements in the sorted list `lst` differ by 1 and the length of `lst` is equal to the length of the set of `lst` (indicating there are no duplicate elements), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `True` if the list contains consecutive integers with no duplicates; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, returns `True` if all consecutive elements in the sorted list differ by 1 and there are no duplicates; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
