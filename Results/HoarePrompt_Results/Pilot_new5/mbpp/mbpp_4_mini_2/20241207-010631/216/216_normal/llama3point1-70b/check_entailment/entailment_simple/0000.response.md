Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to check if a given list contains consecutive numbers. However, it has a flaw in its logic that leads to incorrect results under certain conditions. 

### Explanation of the Issues:

1. **Sorting the list**: The program sorts the list first. While sorting can help in checking for consecutive numbers, it modifies the original order of elements, which may not be desired in some contexts. However, this alone does not invalidate the correctness.

2. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: The main check in the program is done using `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))`. This checks if each element in the sorted list differs from the previous one by exactly 1. This condition is correct for checking consecutive integers.

3. **Checking for duplicates**: The program also checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set of the list (`len(lst) == len(set(lst))`). This is necessary to ensure all numbers are unique, which is a requirement for them to be consecutive.

### Case Where It Fails:
The flaw arises in the case of the empty list or a list with a single element:
- An empty list `[]` or a list with one element `[5]` may be considered to contain "consecutive" numbers since there are no pairs to compare. The program would return `False` for an empty list and `True` for a single element, which is not consistent with the common definition of consecutive numbers.

Therefore, the program does not consistently fulfill the problem requirements for all potential cases, specifically when dealing with empty or single-element lists. Thus, it does not meet the problem description effectively.
