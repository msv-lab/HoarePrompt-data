Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input list contains duplicates properly. For example, the input `[1, 2, 2, 3]` should return `False` because the numbers are not consecutive (the number `2` appears twice), but the program will incorrectly return `True` because it sorts the list and checks for the difference of `1` between consecutive elements, ignoring duplicates.
