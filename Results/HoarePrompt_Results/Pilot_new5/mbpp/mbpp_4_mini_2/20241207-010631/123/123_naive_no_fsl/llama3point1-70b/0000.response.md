Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and splits the list into two parts: the first part containing the first `L` elements and the second part containing the rest of the elements. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct for all potential cases:

1. **When L is less than the length of the list**: The function correctly returns a tuple where the first element is the first `L` elements of the list and the second element is the remaining portion of the list.

2. **When L is equal to the length of the list**: The function will return the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part, which is expected behavior.

3. **When L is greater than the length of the list**: The function will return the entire list as the first part and an empty list for the second part, since slicing does not raise an error if the slice exceeds the list's length.

4. **When L is zero**: The function will return an empty list for the first part and the entire list for the second part, which is also expected and matches the problem description.

Since the function handles all these potential cases correctly, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
