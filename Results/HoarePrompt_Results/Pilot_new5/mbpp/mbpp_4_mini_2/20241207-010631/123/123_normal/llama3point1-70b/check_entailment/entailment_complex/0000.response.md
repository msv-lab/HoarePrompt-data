Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it does so:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`. The condition `0 <= L <= len(lst)` is respected as stated in the precondition.

2. **Output**: The function returns a tuple containing two lists:
   - The first part of the tuple is `lst[:L]`, which slices the list from the beginning up to index `L`. This correctly reflects the requirement to split the list such that the first part has a length of `L`.
   - The second part of the tuple is `lst[L:]`, which slices the list from index `L` to the end. This fulfills the requirement of returning the remaining elements of the list after the first part.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, the first part will be the entire list, and the second part will be an empty list. This behavior is consistent with the problem description.
   - When `L` is 0, the first part will be an empty list, and the second part will be the entire list. Again, this behavior meets the requirements.

4. **General Cases**: For any valid value of `L`, the function will produce two lists as required. 

In all potential cases, the program adheres to the problem description, thus confirming its correctness.
