Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Here's why it is correct:
1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list (`lst`) and an integer (`L`).
2. It returns a tuple consisting of two lists. The first list is derived from slicing the input list from the beginning up to index `L` (i.e., `lst[:L]`), which corresponds to the first part of the list with length `L`.
3. The second list is obtained by slicing the input list from index `L` to the end (i.e., `lst[L:]`), which represents the remaining elements after the first part.

The implementation adheres to the constraints provided:
- The function assumes that `L` is a non-negative integer and that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, ensuring that the slicing operations are valid and do not lead to index errors.
- When `L` is 0, it returns an empty list as the first part and the entire original list as the second part, which is the expected behavior.
- When `L` equals the length of the list, it returns the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part, which is also correct.

Thus, the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
