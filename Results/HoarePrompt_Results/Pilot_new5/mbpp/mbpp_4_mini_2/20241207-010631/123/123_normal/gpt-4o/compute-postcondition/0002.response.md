Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple consisting of two lists: the first list is a slice of `lst` from the start up to index `L`, and the second list is the remainder of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end. If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first list will contain all elements and the second list will be empty. If `L` is 0, the first list will be empty and the second list will contain all elements of `lst`.**
