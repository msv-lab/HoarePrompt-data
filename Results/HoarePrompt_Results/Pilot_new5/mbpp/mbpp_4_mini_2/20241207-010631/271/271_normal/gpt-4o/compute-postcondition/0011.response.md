The variable `elements_at_position` is assigned a new list that contains the second element (index `i`, which is 2) of each inner tuple in `tuples`. Given that `tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing at least one non-empty inner tuple, and `num_elements` is greater than 2, this means `elements_at_position` will be updated to include the second elements of each inner tuple. The value of `avg` is not directly affected by this line of code, but it will likely change when the averages are recalculated later. The state of the other variables remains valid.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is now a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` includes the new value of `avg`.**
