The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length. After executing the function body, it calculates the average of numeric values from the inner tuples by grouping values based on their positions and dividing the sum of each group by the number of inner tuples. The function then returns a list of these averages. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and return a list of averages for these values calculated positionally. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples (a tuple of tuples of numeric values) and returns a list of averages calculated from the inner tuples.**
