To assess the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the code against the problem description and consider the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        averages.append(avg)
    return averages
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and returns a list of average values for each position across all inner tuples. However, if any inner tuple is empty or if there are no inner tuples, a division by zero error may occur when calculating the averages, which is not handled in the code.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code calculates the number of elements in the first inner tuple (`num_elements = len(tuples[0])`), which assumes that at least one inner tuple exists and is non-empty. If `tuples` is empty or contains an empty inner tuple, this will raise an `IndexError`.
   
2. The code then iterates over the range of `num_elements`, calculating the average for each position by collecting values from all inner tuples at that position. It computes the average by summing the collected values and dividing by the total number of inner tuples.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Input**: If `tuples` is empty, the code will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `tuples[0]`.
2. **Inner Tuple Empty**: If any inner tuple is empty, this will also lead to an error when accessing indices, specifically `IndexError`.
3. **Different Length Inner Tuples**: If inner tuples have different lengths, accessing an index that doesn't exist in shorter tuples will raise an `IndexError`.

### Output Hints Validity:
The output hints correctly identify that the function does not handle division by zero errors that may occur if there are no tuples or any empty tuples. They also mention the potential for encountering an `IndexError`, which aligns with my initial assessment.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not handle various edge cases, including empty input, empty inner tuples, or inner tuples of different lengths. Therefore, it does not conform to the problem description in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
