The variable `avg` is assigned the value of the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. The variable `elements_at_position` contains the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, and since `num_elements` is greater than 0 and `tuples` contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, the length of `tuples` will also be greater than 0. Hence, the average can be computed. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**.
