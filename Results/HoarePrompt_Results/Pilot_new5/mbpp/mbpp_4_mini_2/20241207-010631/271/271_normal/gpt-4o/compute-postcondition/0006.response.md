According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `num_elements`. Since `num_elements` is greater than 0 and `i` is currently 0, the loop can execute for the first time.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. The loop can continue executing as long as `i` is less than `num_elements`. Therefore, `num_elements` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, `averages` now includes `avg`.**
