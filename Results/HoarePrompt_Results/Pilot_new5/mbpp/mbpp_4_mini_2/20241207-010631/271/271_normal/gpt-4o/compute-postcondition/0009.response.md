The code `averages.append(avg)` appends the current value of `avg` to the list `averages`. The previous values of the affected variables are `avg`, which is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages`, which now includes `avg`. Since the operation only modifies `averages` by adding `avg` to it, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` now includes the new value of `avg`.**
