The value of `avg` is calculated by taking the sum of `elements_at_position` and dividing it by the length of `tuples`. Since `elements_at_position` already contains the second elements of each inner tuple from `tuples`, and `len(tuples)` is guaranteed to be greater than 2 (as per the initial state), the updated value of `avg` will reflect the average of those second elements. The states of the other variables are not altered. 

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is now a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is now equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` includes the new value of `avg`.**
