The variable `avg` is assigned the value of the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. Given that `num_elements` must be greater than 1, and `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, the value of `avg` would be calculated based on these elements. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` now includes `avg`.**
