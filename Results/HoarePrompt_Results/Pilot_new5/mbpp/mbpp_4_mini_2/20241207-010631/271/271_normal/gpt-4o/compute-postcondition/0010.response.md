According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the `num_elements` variable. If `i` is less than `num_elements`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `num_elements` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `num_elements` must be greater than 2.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` now includes the new value of `avg`.**
