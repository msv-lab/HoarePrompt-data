The code `averages.append(avg)` adds the value of `avg` to the list `averages`. The previous states of the other variables are not affected, and `avg` is still equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` is now a list that includes the previously existing elements plus the newly appended `avg`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, `averages` now includes `avg`.**
