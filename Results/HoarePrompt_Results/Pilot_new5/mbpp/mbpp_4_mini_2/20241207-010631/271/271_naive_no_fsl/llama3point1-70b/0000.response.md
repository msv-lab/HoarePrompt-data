To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The function must take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension along with `zip` to transpose the tuples, summing the corresponding values and dividing by the number of tuples to compute the averages.

Here is the process:
1. `zip(*tuples)` will aggregate the elements of the input tuples by their index.
2. For each group of indexed values, it computes the sum and divides it by the number of tuples to find the average.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Input**: If `tuples` is empty, `zip(*tuples)` will yield an empty iterator, and the list comprehension will return an empty list. This behavior aligns with the expectations since averaging an empty set doesn't have a defined value.
2. **Single Tuple**: If `tuples` consists of a single tuple, the output should simply be the values of that tuple since the average of a single number is the number itself.
3. **Different Length Tuples**: If the inner tuples have different lengths, `zip` will truncate to the shortest tuple, potentially ignoring some values. This could lead to incorrect averages if not all corresponding values are available.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the case where the inner tuples are of different lengths. In such scenarios, it will not compute the average for all available values, leading to incorrect results.

For example:
```python
tuples = ((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))
# Expected behavior: Process all corresponding values.
# Actual behavior: Only processes (1, 3) and (2, 4), ignoring the value 5.
```

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
