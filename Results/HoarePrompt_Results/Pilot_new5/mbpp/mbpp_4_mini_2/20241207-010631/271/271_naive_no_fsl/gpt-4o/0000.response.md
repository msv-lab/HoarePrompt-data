Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of corresponding values from a tuple of tuples, as required by the problem description. 

Explanation:
1. It first determines the number of elements in the first tuple to establish how many positions need to be processed (i.e., `num_elements`).
2. It then iterates over each position (from `0` to `num_elements - 1`), collecting the values from each tuple at the current position `i`.
3. It calculates the average by summing the values collected from all tuples at that position and dividing by the total number of tuples.
4. The computed average is appended to the list `averages`, which is returned at the end.

All provided test cases correctly return the expected outputs, and no edge cases in the current implementation are evident that would lead to incorrect results, such as varying lengths of inner tuples or empty outer tuples. Thus, the function performs as specified for the potential inputs based on the problem description.
