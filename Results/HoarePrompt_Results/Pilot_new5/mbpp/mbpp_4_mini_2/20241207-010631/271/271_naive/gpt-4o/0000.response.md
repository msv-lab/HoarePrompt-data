To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code in detail.

### Problem description:
Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        averages.append(avg)
    return averages
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The function takes a tuple of tuples and calculates the average for each index across all inner tuples. 
2. **Indexing**: It assumes that all inner tuples have the same length as the first tuple, which is not explicitly checked. If the inner tuples vary in length, this will raise an `IndexError`.
3. **Return Values**: The function correctly calculates the average using `sum()` and division for the elements at each index.

### Test Cases Provided:
- The given assertions cover multiple scenarios, including both positive and negative numbers:
    - `(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4)))` results in `[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]`
    - `(((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3)))` results in `[25.5, -18.0, 3.75]`
    - `(((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40)))` results in `[305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]`

### Potential Edge Case:
- If the function is called with tuples of different lengths, for example:
    ```python
    func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6,)))
    ```
  This will raise an `IndexError` because not all inner tuples have the same number of elements.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle cases where the inner tuples have different lengths. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly for every potential input.

Correctness: **False**.
