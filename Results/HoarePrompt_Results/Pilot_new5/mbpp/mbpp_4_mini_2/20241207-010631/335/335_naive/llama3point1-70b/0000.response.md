Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the substring occurs multiple times in the main string. According to the problem description, it is expected to find the occurrence and position of all instances of the substring within the string. For example, if the input string is "banana" and the substring is "ana", the expected output should include both occurrences, but the current implementation only returns the first occurrence. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
