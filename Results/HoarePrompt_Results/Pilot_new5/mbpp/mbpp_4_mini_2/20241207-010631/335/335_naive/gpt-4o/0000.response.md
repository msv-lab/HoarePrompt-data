Correctness: **False**. 

The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the substring appears multiple times in the main string. For example, in the input string `'python programming, python language'` with the substring `'python'`, the function only returns the first occurrence and its positions (0, 6). However, the problem description does not specify that only the first occurrence should be returned. Additionally, there is no handling for cases where the substring might appear consecutively or multiple times, which can lead to confusion or incorrect assumptions about the function's implementation. 

For instance, if we call `func_1('python python python', 'python')`, the expected behavior is ambiguous based on the problem description. The current implementation will return only the first occurrence, missing the intent of finding all occurrences and positions. Hence, the function does not meet the problem requirements fully.
