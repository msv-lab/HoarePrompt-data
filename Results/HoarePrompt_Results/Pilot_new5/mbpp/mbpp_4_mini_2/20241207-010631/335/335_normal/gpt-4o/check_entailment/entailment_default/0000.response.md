To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code itself.

**Problem Description:**
The function is required to find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string and return `None` if there is no match.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. 
2. If `sub_string` is found, it calculates the starting position and the ending position correctly.
3. If `sub_string` is not found, it returns `None`, which matches the problem description.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- What if `sub_string` appears multiple times? The function will only return the first occurrence, which seems correct as per the description.
- What if `sub_string` is an empty string? The behavior of the `find` method in this case would return `0`, which might not be the intended use case since the problem states that `sub_string` should be non-empty.

### Verification with Output Hints:
**Output Hints:**
The hints confirm that the function returns the `sub_string`, the starting index of `sub_string` in `main_string`, and the ending index. If `sub_string` is not found, it returns `None`.

The hints provided seem to align well with the function behavior. The output cases in the hints also confirm the expected outputs and edge cases. Here's a breakdown of the assertions from the output hints:

1. `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python')` returns `('python', 0, 6)` — Correct.
2. `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming')` returns `('programming', 7, 18)` — Correct.
3. `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language')` returns `('language', 31, 39)` — Correct.
4. `func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python')` returns `None` — Correct.

### Conclusion:
The main point of concern is the edge case regarding an empty `sub_string`, but it is implied in the problem description that `sub_string` should be non-empty. 

Given the analysis, since the code handles multiple scenarios correctly as described, and the output hints support the function's behavior without introducing contradictions, I conclude that the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
