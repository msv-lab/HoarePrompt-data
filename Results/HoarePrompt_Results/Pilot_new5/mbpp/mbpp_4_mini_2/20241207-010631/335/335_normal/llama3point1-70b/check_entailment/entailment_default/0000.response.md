The program is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting index, and its ending index if the substring is found. If the substring does not exist within the string, it returns None.

Looking at the code:

```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)
```

1. The `find` method correctly locates the starting index of the substring; if it returns -1, the logic correctly returns None.
2. The ending index is calculated as `start + len(substring)`, and it correctly uses `end - 1` to provide the inclusive ending index.
3. The function does not check for multiple occurrences of the substring, but the problem description does not specify that all occurrences need to be found, only that it must find at least one occurrence.

Now, let's check the output hints:

- The output hints correctly state that the function checks for the existence of `substring` within `string`, returns None if not found, and returns a tuple with the substring and its indices if found.

Next, considering edge cases:

- If the `substring` is at the very beginning of `string`, it should return `(substring, 0, len(substring) - 1)`.
- If the `substring` is at the very end of `string`, the function should also work correctly and return `(substring, start, end - 1)`.
- If the `substring` is longer than the `string`, `string.find(substring)` will return -1, so it should return None.
- If `substring` appears multiple times in `string`, only the first occurrence is returned, which aligns with the problem description.

Upon review, I do not see any scenarios where the code fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the hints also corroborate that the function behaves correctly for the cases mentioned.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code accurately identifies the position of a substring within a string, returning None when not found, and returns the correct start and end indices when found, fulfilling the problem's requirements in all examined cases.
