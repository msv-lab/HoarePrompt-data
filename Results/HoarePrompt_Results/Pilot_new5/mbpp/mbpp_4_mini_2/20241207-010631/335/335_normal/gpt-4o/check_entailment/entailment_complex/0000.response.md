The program provided does not meet the problem description requirements correctly in all cases. Here's the analysis:

1. The function `func_1` is designed to find the first occurrence of a substring (`sub_string`) within a main string (`main_string`) and return a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

2. The function correctly returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the requirement of returning `None` in such cases.

3. However, the problem description states that it should "find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string." This implies that the function should be able to identify multiple occurrences of `sub_string` in `main_string`, not just the first one. The current implementation only finds the first occurrence and does not provide any information about subsequent occurrences.

For example, in the case of the input `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python')`, it successfully finds the first occurrence of 'python', but it does not handle the second occurrence of 'python' after the comma. According to the problem description, the function should ideally return information about all occurrences.

Given this analysis, since the function does not fulfill the requirement of finding all occurrences of the substring, it fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
