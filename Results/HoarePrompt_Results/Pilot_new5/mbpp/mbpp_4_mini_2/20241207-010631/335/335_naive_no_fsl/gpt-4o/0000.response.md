To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description closely.

### Problem Description:
We need to write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and return `None` if there is no match.

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)
```

### Test Cases Provided:
1. `assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)`
2. `assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)`
3. `assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)`
4. `assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None`

### Analysis of the Code:
- The function `find()` is used to get the starting position of the substring. If the substring is not found, it returns `-1`, and the function will return `None`, which is correct.
- If the substring is found, the function calculates the ending position by adding the length of the substring to the starting position.
- The return value is a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case Sensitivity**: The function is case-sensitive. For example, `func_1('Python programming', 'python')` should return `None` but would not be tested by the provided assertions.
2. **Empty Substring**: The function does not handle the case where `sub_string` is an empty string. The expected behavior in such a case is unclear from the problem description. Typically, finding an empty substring should return `(sub_string, 0, 0)` indicating that it occurs at every position in the string.
3. **Substrings at the end**: There are no tests for substrings that occur at the very end of `main_string`, but this is technically covered in the assertions since the end index calculation is done correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, I found that the program does not handle the case of an empty substring. Since the problem description does not specify how to handle empty substrings but the typical behavior would be to return the start and end as `(0, 0)`, this inconsistency indicates a flaw in the program.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly handle the case of an empty substring.
