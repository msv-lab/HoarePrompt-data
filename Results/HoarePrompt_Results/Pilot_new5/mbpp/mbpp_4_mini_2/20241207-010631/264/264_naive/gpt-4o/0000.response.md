Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. The assert statements provided test specific angles (90, 60, and 120 degrees) and confirm that the function returns the expected results. Since there are no apparent edge cases or additional inputs that would cause the function to fail, and it correctly handles the inputs tested, the code is correct.
