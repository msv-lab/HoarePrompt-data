Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function (`func_1`) that converts degrees to radians, which is exactly what the problem description requires. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Conversion Formula**: The function uses the formula for converting degrees to radians: \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right) \). This formula is accurate and universally accepted in mathematics for this conversion.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a numeric value `degrees` as input, which aligns with the problem description stating that `degrees` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the program test the function with various degree inputs (90, 60, and 120) and compare the outputs to the expected radian values. These assertions confirm that the function works correctly for these cases, reinforcing that it adheres to the problem requirements.

Overall, the program fulfills the task of converting degrees to radians effectively and accurately, as specified in the problem description.
