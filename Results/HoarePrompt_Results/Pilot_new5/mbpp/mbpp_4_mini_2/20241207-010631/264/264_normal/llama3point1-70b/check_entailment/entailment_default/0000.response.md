The program described is a function to convert degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). 

Looking at the code:
```python
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
```
This implementation correctly applies the formula for converting degrees to radians and should work for positive and negative numeric values.

However, the problem description does not specify any limitations on the input values. The function does not handle non-numeric inputs (e.g., strings, None) or inputs that could lead to undefined behavior (like complex numbers). This is a potential issue. For example, calling `func_1("90")` would raise a TypeError.

Now examining the output hints:
- The hints state that the function accepts a numeric value `deg` and returns the equivalent angle in radians. 
- It also mentions that the function does not handle non-numeric inputs or angles outside the typical range of degrees, but will compute the conversion for any numeric input.

The output hints confirm that the function does not consider edge cases regarding input type or value. Since the function will indeed produce an error for non-numeric inputs and does not explicitly handle this case, it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.

Based on this analysis, since the program does not correctly handle all potential input cases described:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails when given non-numeric inputs, like a string or None, which the problem description does not account for.
