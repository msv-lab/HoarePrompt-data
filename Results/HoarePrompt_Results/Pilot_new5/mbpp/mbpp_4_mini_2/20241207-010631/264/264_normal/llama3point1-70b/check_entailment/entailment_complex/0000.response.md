Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a numeric input `deg`, representing an angle in degrees, and applies the formula for converting degrees to radians, which is `deg * Ï€ / 180`. 

The annotations clearly outline that:
- The function accepts a numeric value (`deg`) and is expected to return the equivalent angle in radians.
- The formula used for the conversion is accurate and in line with mathematical principles.

Although the function does not handle non-numeric inputs or angles outside the typical range of degrees, the problem description does not specify any constraints regarding input validation or the range of angles. The program performs the conversion correctly for any numeric input, thus fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. 

Therefore, the program meets the defined task, and the assertion that it converts degrees to radians is validated.
