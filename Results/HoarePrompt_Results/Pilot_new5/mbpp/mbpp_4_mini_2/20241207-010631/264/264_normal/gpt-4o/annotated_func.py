#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns the value of degrees multiplied by (math.pi / 180), converting the angle from degrees to radians.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a numeric parameter `degrees` and returns the value of `degrees` converted from degrees to radians by multiplying it with (math.pi / 180). It handles all numeric inputs, including negative values and zero, properly converting them to radians.
