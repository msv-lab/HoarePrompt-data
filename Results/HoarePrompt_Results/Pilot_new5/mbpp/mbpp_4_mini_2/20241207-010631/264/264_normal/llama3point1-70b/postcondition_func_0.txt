The function accepts a numeric value `deg`, representing an angle in degrees, and returns the equivalent angle in radians by multiplying `deg` by Ï€ and dividing by 180. The function does not handle non-numeric inputs or angles outside the typical range of degrees, but it will compute the conversion for any numeric input.
