Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if the specified list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of the list using the `sorted()` function. The comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` evaluates to `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order and `False` otherwise. It handles all the cases, including empty lists and lists with identical elements. Each potential case where a list might be sorted or not is correctly addressed by this implementation.
