Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the original list `nums` to a sorted version of the same list using `sorted(nums)`. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the function works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Empty list**: An empty list (`[]`) is considered sorted. The function will return `True` for this case because both `[]` and `sorted([])` (which is also `[]`) are equal.
   
2. **Single element list**: A list with one element (e.g., `[1]`, `[3]`, or `['a']`) is also sorted. The function will return `True` since the list and its sorted version are identical.

3. **Already sorted lists**: For lists that are already sorted (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `[1, 1, 1]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']`), the function will return `True`, as the original and sorted lists will be the same.

4. **Unsorted lists**: For lists that are not sorted (e.g., `[3, 2, 1]`, `[1, 3, 2]`, or `['b', 'a', 'c']`), the function will return `False`, correctly indicating that they are not sorted.

5. **Lists with mixed types**: Python's sorting behavior can handle lists with mixed types, but if an error were to arise (e.g., comparing integers with strings), it would throw a `TypeError`. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases.

Overall, the function behaves as stipulated in the problem description across all tested cases. Thus, there are no identified edge cases where it fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
