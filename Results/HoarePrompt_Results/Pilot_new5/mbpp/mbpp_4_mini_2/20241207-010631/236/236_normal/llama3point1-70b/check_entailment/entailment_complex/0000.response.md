Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether the specified list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. The function `func_1` takes a list of elements that can be compared and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise. It also appropriately handles an empty list by returning `True`, as an empty list is considered sorted.

The return statement `return nums == sorted(nums)` effectively compares the original list to its sorted version. If they are the same, it means the list is already sorted, and thus the function returns `True`. If not, it returns `False`. 

This behavior aligns with the problem description, fulfilling the requirement to check if the list is sorted and confirming that it handles all potential cases, including lists with any number of elements, including zero. Therefore, the program meets the problem description's specifications.
