#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that are comparable to each other.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that must be sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, and the function does not return False if all comparisons are valid; otherwise, if any `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False, indicating the list is not sorted.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list 'lst' is sorted in non-decreasing order, since all comparisons are valid and no element 'lst[i]' is greater than 'lst[i + 1]'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` of elements that are comparable to each other and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns True if the list is sorted, and False if any element is greater than the subsequent element. The function does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or contains a single element, which would logically be considered sorted as well.
