The given problem description asks for a function to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The provided implementation iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next one.

### Initial Assessment:
The code checks each pair of adjacent elements in the list. If it finds any instance where an element is greater than the next one, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the loop without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

However, the implementation does not handle edge cases where the list is empty or contains only one element. According to the problem description, both an empty list and a list with a single element should logically be considered sorted. Therefore, these edge cases represent a flaw in the implementation.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints confirm that the function checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order and returns `True` or `False` based on the comparisons made. The hints also mention that the function does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains a single element, which aligns with the initial assessment of the code's shortcomings.

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not cover all potential cases specified in the problem description (specifically, it does not return the correct result for empty lists or single-element lists), it cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**.
