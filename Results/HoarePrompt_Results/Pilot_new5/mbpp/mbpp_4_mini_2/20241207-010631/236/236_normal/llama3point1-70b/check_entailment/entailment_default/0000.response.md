To evaluate the provided code and its correctness against the problem description, let's break down the analysis.

**Problem description:** Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns True if the list is sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it returns False. It correctly handles an empty list by returning True, as an empty list is considered sorted.

### Initial Assessment:
The code checks if the list `nums` is equal to its sorted version. This approach is valid:
- It will return `True` for an already sorted list.
- It will return `False` for a list that is not sorted.
- It will return `True` for an empty list, which aligns with the notion that an empty list is considered sorted.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List**: As mentioned, `func_1([])` should return `True`.
- **Single Element List**: A list like `[1]` should also return `True` since a single-element list is trivially sorted.
- **Lists with Duplicate Elements**: A list like `[1, 1, 1]` should return `True`. 
- **Lists with Negative and Positive Numbers**: A list like `[-3, -1, 0, 2]` should return `True`, whereas `[-1, -3, 0, 2]` should return `False`.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints state that the function returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and correctly handles an empty list. All of these assertions are consistent with the behavior of the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
There are no edge cases or scenarios where the function does not meet the problem description. The function effectively checks if the list is sorted for all potential cases, including empty lists and single-element lists.

Correctness: **True**.

The code correctly implements the functionality described by the problem statement, and there are no identified issues with its logic or handling of edge cases.
