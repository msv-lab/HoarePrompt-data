Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must be sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, and the function does not return False if all comparisons are valid; otherwise, if any `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False, indicating the list is not sorted.**
