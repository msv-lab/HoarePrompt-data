Correctness: **False**.

The function is supposed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. However, there is a potential case where the function does not work correctly. 

For instance, consider the input `sorted_list = [1, 2, 4, 5]` and `value = 3`. The expected insertion point for `3` is `2`, as it would be inserted between `2` and `4`. However, the function correctly returns `2` in this case. 

Now consider the input `sorted_list = []` (an empty list) and `value = 3`. The function returns `0`, which is technically correct as there are no elements in the list. But if we check with another value, for example, `value = 0`, it correctly returns `0` as well, which points to the right insertion point.

However, a more critical oversight is that if `value` is equal to the last element in the list, for example, `sorted_list = [1, 2, 3]` and `value = 3`, it returns `2`, which is the position of the last `3` (not an insertion point but an index). The correct behavior should return the index `3` since the insertion would happen after the last element.

Thus, the program does not always locate the correct insertion point, particularly when the `value` is equal to the last item in the sorted list. This inconsistency leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
