The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list` and `value`. `sorted_list` is a list of integers that is sorted in ascending order, and `value` is an integer that needs to be inserted into this list. 

After executing the function body, the return value is determined by several cases:
- Case 1: If the first element of `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns the index `0`.
- Case 2: If the conditions for Case 1 are not met and the second element is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns the index `1`.
- Case 3: If neither Case 1 nor Case 2 conditions are satisfied and the third element is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns the index `2`.
- Case 4: If all previous cases are not satisfied, the function returns the length of `sorted_list`, indicating the position where `value` would be inserted at the end of the list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers and an integer value, and return the index where the value can be inserted while maintaining the order of the list. The specific index returned depends on the comparison between the value and the elements of the sorted list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter sorted_list (a sorted list of integers) and value (an integer), returning the index where the value can be inserted in sorted order based on comparisons with the elements in sorted_list.**
