According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `sorted_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `sorted_list` has at least 2 elements, so `len(sorted_list)` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be 2, and `sorted_list` must have at least 3 elements to allow for the next iteration.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order with at least 3 elements, `value` is an integer, and `i` is 2**
