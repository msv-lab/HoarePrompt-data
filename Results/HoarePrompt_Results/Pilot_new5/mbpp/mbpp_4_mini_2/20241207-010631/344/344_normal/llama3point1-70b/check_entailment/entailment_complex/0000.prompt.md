You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers in sorted order, and value is an integer that needs to be inserted.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order, `value` is an integer that needs to be inserted, `i` is the index where `value` can be inserted while maintaining sorted order, or `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list` if `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`. If the loop does not execute, then `i` is 0 and `sorted_list` is unchanged, meaning it has at least 0 elements.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of 'sorted_list', which is the number of integers it contains in sorted order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, returning the index at which the value can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If the value is less than or equal to any of the integers in the list, it returns the index of the first such integer. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which indicates that the value should be appended at the end of the list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
