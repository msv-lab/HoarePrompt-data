Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria for locating the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order:

1. **Input Specifications**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers in sorted order, and `value`, which is the integer that needs to be inserted. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Insertion Logic**: The program iterates through each element of the `sorted_list`. It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `value`. If it finds such an element, it returns the index `i` of that element, which is the correct insertion point to maintain the sorted order.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If `value` is less than the smallest element in `sorted_list`, the loop will not execute, and `i` will be `0`, which correctly indicates that the value should be inserted at the beginning.
   - If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, the loop will complete, and the function will return `len(sorted_list)`, which correctly indicates that the value should be appended at the end.

4. **Return Value**: The return values of the function (either the index of the first element greater than or equal to `value` or the length of the list) are all valid and correctly identify the position for insertion, ensuring that the sorted order is maintained.

Therefore, the function correctly meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, and the correctness of the implementation can be confirmed.
