Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order. Here's the explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers (`sorted_list`) and an integer value (`value`) that needs to be inserted.

2. **Iterating through the list**: The `for` loop iterates through each element in `sorted_list`. For each element, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the value that needs to be inserted.

3. **Return the insertion point**: 
   - If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the `value`, it returns the current index `i`. This index is the correct position to insert `value` while maintaining the sorted order.
   - If the loop completes without finding an element greater than or equal to `value`, it returns `len(sorted_list)`, which indicates that `value` is greater than all elements in the list and should be inserted at the end.

4. **Handling edge cases**: 
   - The function handles the case where `sorted_list` is empty (returns 0) correctly.
   - It also properly deals with scenarios where `value` is less than the smallest element or greater than the largest element.

Overall, the logic correctly identifies the insertion point for any integer value in the provided sorted list, thus fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
