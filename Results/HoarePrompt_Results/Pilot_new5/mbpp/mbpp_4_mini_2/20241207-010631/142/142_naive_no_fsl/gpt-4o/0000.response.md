Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` does not handle the case when the input list is empty. According to the problem description, if the list is empty, it should return whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. However, the current implementation will return `True` for an empty list, as there are no items to compare, which is logically inconsistent with the requirement.

For example:
- `func_1([], 'blue')` should reasonably return `False` since there are no items in the list that can be equal to 'blue', but it currently returns `True`.

Thus, since the program does not handle this scenario correctly, the correctness is **False**.
