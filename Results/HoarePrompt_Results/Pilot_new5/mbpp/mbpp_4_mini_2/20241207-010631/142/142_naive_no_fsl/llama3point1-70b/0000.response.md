Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst, element)` checks if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the specified `element`. It uses the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression that iterates through each `item` in `lst` and checks if `item` is equal to `element`.

This logic correctly implements the requirement of the problem description. Here are a few potential cases to validate its correctness:

1. **Case with all equal elements**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, 1, 1], 1)` returns `True`.
   
2. **Case with at least one different element**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 1], 1)` returns `False`.

3. **Case with an empty list**: 
   - Input: `func_1([], 1)` returns `True` since there are no elements in the list to contradict the condition.

4. **Case with a single element list**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1], 1)` returns `True`.

5. **Case with different types**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, '1', 1], 1)` returns `False` since the string and integer are not equal.

All potential edge cases have been considered, and the function behaves as expected in each case. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
