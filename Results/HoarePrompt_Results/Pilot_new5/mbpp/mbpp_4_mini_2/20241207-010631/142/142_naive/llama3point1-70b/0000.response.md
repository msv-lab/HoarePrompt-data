Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The use of the `all()` function combined with a generator expression efficiently checks each item in the list against the specified element. 

Let's evaluate potential cases:
1. If `lst` is an empty list, the function will correctly return `True` since there are no items to contradict the condition.
2. If all elements in `lst` are the same as `element`, it will return `True`.
3. If at least one element in `lst` is different from `element`, it will correctly return `False`.

Thus, the function covers all scenarios as described in the problem statement.
