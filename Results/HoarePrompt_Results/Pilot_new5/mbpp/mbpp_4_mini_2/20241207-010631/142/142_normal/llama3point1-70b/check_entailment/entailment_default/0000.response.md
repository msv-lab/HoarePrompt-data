The given program checks if all items in a list are equal to a specified element. Let's analyze the code and see if it meets the problem description:

```python
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all((item == element for item in lst))
```

### Initial Assessment
- The function utilizes the built-in `all()` function, which returns `True` if all items in the iterable are `True`.
- The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` checks if each item in `lst` is equal to `element`.
- If the list is empty (`lst = []`), the `all()` function will return `True` because there are no elements that contradict the condition (this aligns with the definition of vacuous truth).

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
1. An empty list should return `True` because there are no items to check against the element.
2. A list with a single element should return `True` if that element equals `element` and `False` otherwise.
3. A list with multiple elements should return `True` if all elements equal `element`, and `False` if at least one does not.

### Output Hints
The output hints state:
- The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`.
- It returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`, otherwise `False`.
- It correctly handles the edge case of an empty list.

The output hints accurately reflect the behavior of the code. They confirm that:
- An empty list returns `True`.
- The function checks for equality for all items in the list.

### Conclusion
The program works correctly according to the provided problem description and handles edge cases as described. There are no examples provided that demonstrate the function failing to meet the specifications.

Therefore, after confirming that the output hints align with the code and the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code accurately checks if all items in the input list are equal to the specified element, including handling an empty list correctly.
