According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If the list `lst` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `item` is defined as the first element of the list `lst` and that `lst` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `lst` must have at least 1 element, and `item` should be set to the first element of the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `item` is the first element in the list**
