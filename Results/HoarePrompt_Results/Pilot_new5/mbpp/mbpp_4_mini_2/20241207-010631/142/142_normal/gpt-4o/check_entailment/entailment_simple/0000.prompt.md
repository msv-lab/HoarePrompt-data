You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value that can be of any type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list where all elements are equal to `element`, or the function has returned False if any element was not equal to `element`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list 'lst' are equal to 'element'

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
