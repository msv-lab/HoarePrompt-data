Initial State: `lst` is a list of elements, and `element` is a value that can be of any type.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` is a list of elements that has at least 1 element, `item` is the first element in the list, and `item` is equal to `element`.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, and `item` is the second element in the list. If `item` is not equal to `element`, the function returns False. If `item` is equal to `element`, there is no return value from the function.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `lst` is a list with at least 3 elements and `item` is the third element of the list. If `item` is not equal to `element`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no return value specified.

Output State after the loop executes fully: `lst` is a list where all elements are equal to `element`, or the loop exits early due to the first element that is not equal to `element` causing the function to return False. If the loop completes, all items in `lst` match `element`. If the loop does not complete, it means at least one item in `lst` is different from `element`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list where all elements are equal to `element`, or the function has returned False if any element was not equal to `element`.**
