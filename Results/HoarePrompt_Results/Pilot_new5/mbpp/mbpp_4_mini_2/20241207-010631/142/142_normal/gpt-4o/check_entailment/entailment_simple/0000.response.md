Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and a value `element`. This aligns with the requirement to check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

2. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each item in the list `lst`. For each iteration, it checks if the current item (`item`) is not equal to the `element`. If it finds any item that does not match the `element`, it immediately returns `False`.

3. If the loop completes without finding any differences, the function returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list are equal to the specified `element`.

4. The assertions provided test various scenarios:
   - When the list contains different strings and the element is a string that is not in the list, it returns `False`.
   - When the list contains different integers and the element is a value not present in the list, it also returns `False`.
   - When all elements in the list are the same as the `element`, it correctly returns `True`.

The logic ensures that any potential case is covered, and the program behaves as intended according to the problem description. Thus, it is accurate and complete.
