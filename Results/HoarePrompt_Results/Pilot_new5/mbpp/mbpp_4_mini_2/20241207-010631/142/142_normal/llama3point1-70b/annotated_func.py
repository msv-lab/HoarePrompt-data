#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is an item that can be of any type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all items in the list 'lst' are equal to 'element', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where `lst` is empty, which will return `True` because all (zero) elements trivially equal `element`. There are no exceptions or errors accounted for in the implementation, making it straightforward and robust for the purpose described.
