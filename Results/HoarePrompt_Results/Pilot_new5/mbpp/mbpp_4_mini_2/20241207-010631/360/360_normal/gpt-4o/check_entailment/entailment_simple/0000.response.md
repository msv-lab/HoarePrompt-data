Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Sum Calculation**: Inside the function, it iterates through each sublist in the input list. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements using the `sum()` function. This is exactly what is needed to determine which sublist has the highest sum.

3. **Comparison Logic**: The program maintains a variable `max_sum` initialized to negative infinity, ensuring that any valid sublist sum will be larger. The program updates `max_sum` and `max_list` whenever it finds a sublist with a sum greater than the current `max_sum`. This ensures that at the end of the iteration, `max_list` contains the sublist with the highest sum.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum. If the input list is empty, `max_list` will remain an empty list, which is a valid output given that there are no sublists to evaluate.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves correctly for various cases, including:
   - A case with multiple sublists where one clearly has the highest sum.
   - A case with only one sublist.
   - Multiple sublists with varying sums.

Given these points, the program consistently meets the problem requirements and correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum, thus fulfilling the problem description.
