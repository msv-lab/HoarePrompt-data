The code assigns the value of `sublist` to `max_list`. Given that `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists` and that `current_sum` (the sum of this sublist) is greater than the original `max_sum`, we establish that `max_list` now contains the values of that first sublist. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist; `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`; `max_list` is equal to the first sublist in `list_of_lists`; `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`; `current_sum` is the sum of the first sublist and is greater than the original `max_sum`.**
