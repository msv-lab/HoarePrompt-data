The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value of negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This means that `max_sum` is now set to the lowest possible floating point value. The other variable, `list_of_lists`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, and `max_sum` is now negative infinity.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_sum` is negative infinity**.
