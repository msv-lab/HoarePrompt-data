Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, and `max_list` is set to `sublist`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
