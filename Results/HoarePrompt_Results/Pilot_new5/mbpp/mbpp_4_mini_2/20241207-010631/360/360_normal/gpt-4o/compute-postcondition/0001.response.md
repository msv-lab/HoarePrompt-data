The code initializes `max_list` as an empty list. The previous values of `list_of_lists` and `max_sum` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables and the new state of `max_list`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list.**
