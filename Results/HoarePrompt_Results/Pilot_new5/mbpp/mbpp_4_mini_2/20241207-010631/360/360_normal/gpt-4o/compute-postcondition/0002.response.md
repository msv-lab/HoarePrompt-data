According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list contains at least one sublist, the loop will execute. Given that `max_sum` is negative infinity and `max_list` is an empty list, these values are not relevant to whether the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list must contain at least one sublist. Additionally, `sublist` should be the first sublist in `list_of_lists` during the first iteration.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**
