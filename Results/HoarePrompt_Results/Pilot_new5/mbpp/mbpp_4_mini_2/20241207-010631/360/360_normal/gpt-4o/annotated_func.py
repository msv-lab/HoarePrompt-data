#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (integers or floats).
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_sum` is the maximum sum of elements from any sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the sublist from `list_of_lists` that has the maximum sum, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_sum` remains negative infinity and `max_list` remains an empty list.
    return max_list
    #The program returns the sublist `max_list` from `list_of_lists` that has the maximum sum, which could be an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists containing numerical elements and returns the inner list that has the maximum sum of its elements. If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns an empty list.
