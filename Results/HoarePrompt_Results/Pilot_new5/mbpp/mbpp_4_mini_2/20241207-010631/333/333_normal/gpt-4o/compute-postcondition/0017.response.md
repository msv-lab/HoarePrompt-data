Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `stack` remains unchanged or has `char` appended to it. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, then `char` is appended to `stack`. Otherwise, if `char` is in `matching_pairs` and `stack` is empty or the top element of `stack` does not match the corresponding pair for `char`, the function returns False; in all other cases, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
