The variable `stack` is initialized as an empty list. The `expr` remains unchanged, as it is a string containing various types of parentheses and other characters. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialized value of `stack`.

Output State: **`expr` is a string that may contain various types of parentheses (such as '()', '{}', '[]') and other characters; `stack` is an empty list.**
