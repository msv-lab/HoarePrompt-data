The `stack` variable is modified by appending the `char` variable to it. The initial state indicates that `expr` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, and `char` is the next character in `expr`. The `stack` variable is unchanged except for the addition of `char`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `stack` now includes the new `char`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string with at least one remaining character, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` has `char` appended to it.**
