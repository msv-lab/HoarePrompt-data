Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string with at least one remaining character, `char` is the next character in `expr`. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, then `stack` has `char` appended to it. Otherwise, if `char` is in `matching_pairs` and `stack` is empty or the top of `stack` does not match the corresponding character in `matching_pairs` for `char`, the function returns False. If neither condition applies, the function maintains its current return value, and `stack` remains unchanged or has `char` appended to it.***
