Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a non-empty list, `char` is the first character of `expr`, `char` is not a value in the `matching_pairs` dictionary, and the current value of `char` is in `matching_pairs`. The top element of `stack` matches the value of `matching_pairs[char]`, and the value of `char` is successfully matched with the last added element from `stack` after popping.***
