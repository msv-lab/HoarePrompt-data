The function accepts a string `expression` and checks if all types of brackets (parentheses '()', curly braces '{}', and square brackets '[]') are correctly matched and nested. It returns True if all brackets are matched and there are no unmatched opening brackets left; otherwise, it returns False. Additionally, if the expression contains any characters that are not brackets, they are ignored in the matching process.
