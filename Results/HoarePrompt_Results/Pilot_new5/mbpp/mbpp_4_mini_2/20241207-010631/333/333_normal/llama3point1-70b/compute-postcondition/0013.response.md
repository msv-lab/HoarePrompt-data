The code `stack.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the `stack`. The initial state indicates that `stack` is an empty list and `char` is the second character of the `expression`. After executing the code, `stack` will contain one element, which is the value of `char`.

Since `stack` was initially an empty list, after execution, it will have one element which is `char`. The value of `expression` and the fact that `char` is derived from it remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stack` is a list containing the second character of `expression`, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the second character of the expression**.
