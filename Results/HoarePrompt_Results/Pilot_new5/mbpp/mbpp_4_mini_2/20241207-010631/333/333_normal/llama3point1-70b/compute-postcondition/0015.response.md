Postcondition: ***`stack` is an empty list, `expression` is a non-empty string, and `char` is the second character of the expression. If `stack` is empty or the popped character from `stack` does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping, the program returns False. Otherwise, there are no changes and the program continues execution.***
