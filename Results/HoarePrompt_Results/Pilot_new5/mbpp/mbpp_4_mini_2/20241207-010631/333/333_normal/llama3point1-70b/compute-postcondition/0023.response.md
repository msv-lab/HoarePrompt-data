Postcondition: ***`stack` is an empty list, `expression` is a non-empty string, and `char` is the third character of `expression`. If `char` is a bracket, then `stack` contains `char`. If `char` is not a bracket, there are no changes to the state of the program. If `char` is in `brackets.values()` and `stack` is empty or the character corresponding to the popped element from `stack` does not match `char`, the function returns False; otherwise, there is no return value.***
