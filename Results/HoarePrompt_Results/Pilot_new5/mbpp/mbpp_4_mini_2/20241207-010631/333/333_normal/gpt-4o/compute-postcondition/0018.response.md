According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `expr`. If `expr` has at least one more character remaining, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `expr` is a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining, and `char` is the next character in `expr`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `char` must be the next character in `expr`, which means that `char` will change to the next character, and the length of `expr` must decrease by one. Therefore, the state should reflect that `char` is now the next character in the string and that there is still at least one character remaining in `expr`.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string with at least one remaining character, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `stack` remains unchanged or has `char` appended to it.**
