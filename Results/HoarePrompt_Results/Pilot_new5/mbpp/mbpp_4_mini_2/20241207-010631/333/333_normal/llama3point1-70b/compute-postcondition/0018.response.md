According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `expression`. Since `char` is the second character of `expression`, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the third character in `expression`. Given that `stack` is currently empty, it is unaffected by the previous iteration because `char` was not in `brackets` in the last iteration. Therefore, `char` will be updated to the next character in `expression`, which is the third character.

State: **`stack` is an empty list, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the third character of `expression`**
