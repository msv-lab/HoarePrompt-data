Postcondition: ***`stack` is an empty list, `expression` is a non-empty string, and `char` is the first character of the expression which is not in brackets. If `char` is found in the values of `brackets`, then it corresponds to the value in `brackets` after popping from `stack` (if `stack` were not empty). There is no else part to consider.***
