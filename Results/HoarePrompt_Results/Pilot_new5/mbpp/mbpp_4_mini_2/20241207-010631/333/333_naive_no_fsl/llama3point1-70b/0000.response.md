Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check if the given expression is balanced in terms of brackets. It handles three types of brackets: parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:
1. A stack is used to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the expression.
2. The program iterates through each character in the input expression:
   - If it encounters an opening bracket (one of `(`, `{`, `[`), it pushes it onto the stack.
   - If it encounters a closing bracket (one of `)`, `}`, `]`), it checks:
     - If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns `False`.
     - If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element and checks if it matches with the current closing bracket using the `brackets` dictionary.
3. Finally, it returns `True` if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets were matched), and `False` otherwise.

The function handles various edge cases, such as:
- An empty string returns `True`, as there are no unmatched brackets.
- Expressions with no brackets return `True`.
- Nested and mixed types of brackets are correctly matched.

Given all these considerations, the program adheres to the problem description and successfully identifies balanced expressions.
