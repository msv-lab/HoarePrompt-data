Correctness: **False**.

The provided implementation does not correctly identify all cases of balanced expressions. Specifically, it fails for expressions where there are unmatched opening brackets. For example, the expression `'{[}'` should return `False`, but the code would incorrectly evaluate it as balanced. 

Additionally, brackets should be checked in pairs, and the logic used in the current implementation may not account for all scenarios properly. The condition `stack == []` at the end only checks if all opened brackets were closed, but it does not handle the edge case of nested incomplete pairs correctly. 

Therefore, there are potential cases where the program does not work as expected, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
