Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly checks if the given expression is balanced in terms of parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that for every closing bracket encountered, there is a corresponding opening bracket in the correct order. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:
- It initializes an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.
- It iterates over each character in the expression:
  - If the character is an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack.
  - If it is a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (indicating an unmatched closing bracket) or if the closing bracket does not match the most recent opening bracket on the stack.
- At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were matched, so it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

No edge cases or potential inputs are missed, and the logic covers all scenarios for balanced expressions. Thus, the program is correct.
