Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle edge cases such as when `n` is greater than the length of the list. For example, if we call `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'], 5)`, we expect it to return `[['a'], ['b'], ['c']]` because there are only three elements in the list, but the program will return `[[], [], [], [], []]`, which is incorrect. This shows that the implementation is not robust for all potential inputs.
