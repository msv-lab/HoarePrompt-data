To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the code implementation.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes in a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list for every `nth` element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input List**: The function takes a list `lst`.
2. **Integer n**: The function takes an integer `n`.
3. **Output**: The function is expected to return a list of lists, where each inner list contains elements from the original list, starting from indices `i` and then taking every `n`-th element.

### Key Considerations:
- If `n` is zero or negative, the operation of splitting based on `n` does not make sense.
- If `n` is greater than the length of the list, the resulting splits may not behave as intended.
- Empty lists or lists shorter than `n` should also be considered.

### Test Cases:
1. **Basic Case**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)` should return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`.
2. **Edge Case with n = 0**: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` â€“ This should raise an error since slicing with a step of zero is not valid.
3. **Edge Case with n > len(lst)**: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` should return `[[1], [2], [3]]`, but the expected behavior based on the description is unclear if `n` exceeds list length.
4. **Empty List**: `func_1([], 2)` should return `[[], []]` if `n` is 2, but the behavior is also ambiguous for empty input.
5. **Single Element List**: `func_1([1], 1)` should return `[[1]]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not handle the case when `n` is zero or negative, which could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, the functionality when `n` exceeds the length of the list is not well-defined in the problem description. 

Therefore, it seems that the implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
