To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem statement, the code, and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that takes in a list and an integer `n`, then splits the list into sublists for every nth element, returning a list of these resulting lists.

### Provided Code
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Initial Assessment of the Code
The code uses list comprehension to create a new list where each element is a sublist of `lst`, starting from index `i` and taking every `n`-th element. It iterates `i` from `0` to `n-1`. 

#### Potential Edge Cases:
1. If `n` is `0`, this would raise a division by zero error in a real case, but the code does not handle this situation.
2. If `n` is greater than the length of the list `lst`, according to the description, it should still return sublists, and the code appears to handle this correctly by not raising an error, but we should check if it behaves as expected.
3. An example input where `lst` is empty (`[]`) with any `n` should also return an empty list, but we need to see if that is handled correctly.
4. If `n` is `1`, it should return the original list as a list of one sublist.

### Output Hints
The hints state the function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, returning sublists starting from each index `i` in the range of `n`. It also mentions that if `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still operate correctly without errors.

### Agreement of Hints with Code
1. The hints indicate the function will split the list correctly according to the description, which aligns with the code's logic.
2. The hints do not mention how the function behaves when `n` is `0`, nor when `n` is greater than the length of the list, which could lead to confusion.

### Conclusion
- The code does not handle the case when `n` is `0`, meaning an input like `([], 0)` would not work as expected and would result in an error.
- The program lacks checks for `n` being zero or negative, which is critical for robustness.

Since there is at least one case (when `n` is `0`) that the code does not handle correctly, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
