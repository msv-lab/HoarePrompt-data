Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` taken every `n` elements starting from each index `i` in the range of `n`. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the resulting sublists may contain fewer elements, but the function will still operate as intended without errors.**
