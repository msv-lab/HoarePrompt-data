The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. The parameter `lst` is a list of elements, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. After executing the function body, the program returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` taken every `n` elements starting from index `i`, for each `i` in the range of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of sublists formed by grouping elements of `lst` at intervals of `n` for all starting indices from 0 to `n-1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists containing elements from `lst`, taken every `n` elements starting from each index `i` in the range of `n`.**
