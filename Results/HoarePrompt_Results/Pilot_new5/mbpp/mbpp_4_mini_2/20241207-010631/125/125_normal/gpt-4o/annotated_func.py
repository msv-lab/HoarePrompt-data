#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that must contain at least `n` elements, `result` is a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` distributed cyclically based on their original order.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result', which consists of 'n' sublists created by distributing the elements of 'lst' cyclically based on their original order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, where `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `lst`. It returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` distributed cyclically based on their original order. If `lst` contains fewer than `n` elements, the behavior is undefined as per the given code, since it assumes that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. However, the code will correctly distribute the elements if `n` is valid.
