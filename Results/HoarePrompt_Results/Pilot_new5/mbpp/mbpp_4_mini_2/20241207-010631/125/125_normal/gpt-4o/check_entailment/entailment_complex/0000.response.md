Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst, n)` correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and it splits the list into `n` sublists such that the elements are distributed cyclically based on their original order.

### Explanation:

1. **Functionality**: The function initializes a list called `result` with `n` empty sublists. It iterates over the elements of `lst` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index (`i`) and the element itself. By using the expression `i % n`, the function determines which sublist to append the current element to. This effectively distributes the elements of `lst` into `n` different lists, cycling through them.

2. **Correctness Against the Problem Description**:
   - The program satisfies the requirement to split the input list into `n` lists for every `nth` element.
   - The provided assertions confirm that the function produces the expected outputs for multiple test cases, including both strings and integers.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function assumes `n` is always less than or equal to the length of `lst`, as stated in the precondition. Therefore, it does not need to account for cases where `n` could be greater than the length of `lst`. This assumption is validated by the constraints given in the problem statement.

Overall, the function accurately fulfills the problem description by cyclically distributing elements into sublists, and the additional assertions demonstrate its correctness across various scenarios.
