The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. `lst` is a list of elements, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. The output of the function is a list `result`, which consists of `n` sublists. These sublists are created by distributing the elements of `lst` cyclically based on their original order. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of `n` sublists formed by cyclically distributing the elements of `lst`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a positive integer n, returns a list of n sublists formed by cyclically distributing the elements of lst.**
