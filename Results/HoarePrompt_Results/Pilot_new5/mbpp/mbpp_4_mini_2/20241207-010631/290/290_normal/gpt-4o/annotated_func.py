#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the substring of 's' from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, and the substring `s[1:-1]` does not contain the character 'z'.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the condition was met as 's[1:-1]' does not contain the character 'z'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and checks if the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z'. It returns True if 'z' is found; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle cases where the length of `s` is less than 3, which would result in incorrect behavior since `s[1:-1]` would return an empty string, and the function would return False without any indication of the input's length.
