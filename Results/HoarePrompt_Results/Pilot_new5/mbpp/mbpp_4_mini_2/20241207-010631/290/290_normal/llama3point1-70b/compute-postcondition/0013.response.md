The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string. After executing the function body, it has the following possible return values based on the conditions checked within the function:

- Case 1: The function returns `True` if the conditions for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring of 'word' (excluding the first and last characters) are satisfied.
- Case 2: The function returns `True` under another specific condition.
- Case 3: The function returns `True` under yet another specific condition.
- Case 4: The function returns `False` if no word with length greater than 1 containing 'z' in the substring that excludes the first and last characters was found in the list of words obtained from the string 's'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and evaluate certain conditions related to the presence of the character 'z' in substrings of words derived from `s`, returning either `True` or `False` based on those evaluations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is a string, and returns True or False based on the evaluation of the presence of the character 'z' in certain substrings of the words derived from s.**
