The code `words = s.split()` assigns a list of words to the variable `words`, which is generated by splitting the string `s` at whitespace. The original state of `s` remains unchanged, but `words` will now contain the individual words from `s` as elements of a list. 

Output State: **`s` is a string; `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`**.
