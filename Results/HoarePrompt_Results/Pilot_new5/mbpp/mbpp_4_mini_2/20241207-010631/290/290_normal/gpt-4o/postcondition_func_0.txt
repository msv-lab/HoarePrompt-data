The function accepts a string `s` and checks if the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z'. It returns True if 'z' is found; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle cases where the length of `s` is less than 3, which would result in incorrect behavior since `s[1:-1]` would return an empty string, and the function would return False without any indication of the input's length.
