The program is designed to check if the string `s` contains the letter 'z' anywhere except at the start and end of the string. Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input.
2. The condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` checks if 'z' is present in the substring of `s` that excludes the first and last character.
3. If 'z' is found in this substring, it returns `True`.
4. If 'z' is not found, it returns `False`.

### Test Cases:
- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True`: This is correct because 'z' is found in the substring `pythonzabc.` (which is `ythonzabc`).
- `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False`: This is correct because 'z' is at the start of the string, and hence should not count.
- `func_1('  lang  .')` returns `False`: This is correct because there is no 'z' in the substring ` lang `.

### Conclusion:
The implementation satisfies the problem description correctly. It successfully checks for the presence of 'z' in the substring of `s` that excludes the first and last characters, thus adhering to the requirement. 

No edge cases have been missed, and all specified conditions are correctly implemented in the function.

Correctness: **True**
