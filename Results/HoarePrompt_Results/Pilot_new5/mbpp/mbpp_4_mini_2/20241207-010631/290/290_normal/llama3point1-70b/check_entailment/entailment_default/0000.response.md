To assess the correctness of the provided program, we start by analyzing the problem description and the actual code.

**Problem Description:**  
The program is supposed to check if a string contains the character 'z', but only in the middle of words (i.e., not at the start or end of any word). 

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False
```

**Initial Assessment:**
The function `func_1` splits the input string into words and checks for the presence of the character 'z' within each word, but only between its first and last characters (i.e., it checks `word[1:-1]`). If a word has a length greater than 1 and contains 'z' in that range, it returns `True`. If no such word exists, it returns `False`. 

The implementation seems to match the problem description for typical cases. However, we need to consider edge cases:
1. Single-character words should not be counted but will not cause any issues since the check for length `> 1` handles this.
2. If a word does not have a 'z' in the specified range, it correctly continues to the next word.
3. The function will return `False` if the string is empty or consists solely of one-character words without 'z'.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints describe that the function returns `True` if any word (with length greater than 1) contains 'z' within its substring that excludes the first and last characters. This aligns with what the code does and confirms our previous assessment.

**Final Verification:**
We need to ensure that all potential cases are covered by the program:
- A word with 'z' at index 1 or -1 should not lead to a `True` return.
- A string with multiple words, where at least one contains 'z' in the middle, should return `True`.
- A string with multiple words, where none have 'z' in the middle, should return `False`.

Upon checking these potential cases, the function appears to correctly implement the logic as described, and no edge cases where the function would fail to meet the specifications of the problem description can be identified.

Based on this thorough analysis, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly implements the requirement to check for 'z' in the middle of words (not at the start or end) and handles all relevant edge cases as per the problem description.
