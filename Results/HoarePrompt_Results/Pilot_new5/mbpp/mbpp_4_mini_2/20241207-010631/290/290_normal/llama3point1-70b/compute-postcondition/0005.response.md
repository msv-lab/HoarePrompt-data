According to the code, for the loop to execute again, it depends on the `words` list. Since `words` must have at least 1 word for the loop to run, and `word` is currently the first word in the list, we need to check the length of `words`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `word` is the first word in the list, and since the loop iterates over each word in `words`, the next word would be the second word in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `words` must have at least 2 words. 

The condition about the first and last characters of `word` will determine the next word, but since we are focused on the next iteration, we only need to update `word` to the second word in the list and ensure `words` has at least 2 words.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `words` is a list of words that must have at least 2 words, `word` is the second word in the list.**
