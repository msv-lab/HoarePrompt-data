According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `words` list. If the list contains at least 3 words, the loop will execute one more time for the third word. At the end of the last iteration, `words` contains at least 2 words and `word` is the second word in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `words` must contain at least 3 words, and `word` will be updated to the third word in the list.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `words` is a list containing at least 3 words, `word` is the third word in the list.**
