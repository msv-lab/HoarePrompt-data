Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `words` is a list containing at least 2 words, and `word` is the second word in this list. If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and 'z' is present in the substring of `word` from index 1 to the second last index, the function returns True. If these conditions are not met, the function does not return any value.***
