Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly sums the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts them back to integers, and then sums them. 

For example:
- For the input `123`, the digits are `1`, `2`, and `3`, and their sum is `6`.
- For the input `0`, the only digit is `0`, and the sum is `0`.
- For larger numbers like `4567`, the digits `4`, `5`, `6`, and `7` will sum to `22`.

The function handles all non-negative integers as required by the problem description, and there are no edge cases that it fails to address. Thus, the implementation meets the specifications, confirming its correctness.
