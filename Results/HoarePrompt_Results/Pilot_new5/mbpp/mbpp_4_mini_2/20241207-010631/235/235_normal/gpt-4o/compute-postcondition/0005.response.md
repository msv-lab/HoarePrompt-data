The value of `total` is updated by adding `n % 10` to it. Given that `total` is initially equal to `n % 10`, the effect of this operation is that `total` is doubled. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the precondition holds as `n` is still greater than or equal to 10. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `total` is equal to `2 * (n % 10)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 10; `total` is equal to `2 * (n % 10)`**.
