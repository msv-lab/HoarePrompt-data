According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is equal to `n // 10`, which means it has been reduced to the integer division of its previous value by 10. Since `n` is greater than 0, it must have been at least 1 before the integer division took place.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 after the integer division. The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` must be at least 1 before the division. Hence, the previous value of `n` needed to be greater than or equal to 10 (since if it was 10 or higher, `n // 10` would result in at least 1).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 10 and `total` is equal to `n % 10`**
