According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than 0. Since `n` is currently at least 1, no adjustments are necessary for `n`. 

The other state, `total`, does not affect the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `total` is equal to `2 * (n % 10)`**
