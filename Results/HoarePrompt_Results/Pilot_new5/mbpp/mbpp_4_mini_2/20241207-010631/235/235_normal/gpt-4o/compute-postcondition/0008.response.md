The variable `total` is updated by adding `n % 10` to its previous value. The initial value of `total` is `2 * (n % 10)`. Therefore, after the operation, the new value of `total` will be:

```
total = total + (n % 10)
total = 2 * (n % 10) + (n % 10)
total = 3 * (n % 10)
```

The value of `n` remains unchanged, and it is still greater than or equal to 1. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `total` is equal to `3 * (n % 10)`**
