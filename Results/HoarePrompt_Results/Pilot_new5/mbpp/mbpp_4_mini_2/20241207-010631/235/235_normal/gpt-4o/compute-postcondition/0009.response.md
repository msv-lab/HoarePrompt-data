The value of `n` is updated by performing an integer division by `10`. Since `n` is initially greater than or equal to 1, the new value of `n` will be at least `0` after the operation. The value of `total` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. 

The previous value of `n` can be expressed as `n` (where `n >= 1`), and after the operation, `n` is reduced to `n // 10`, which will be a non-negative integer. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is now `n // 10`, `total` is equal to `3 * (n % 10)`.

Output State: **`n` is now `n // 10`; `total` is equal to `3 * (n % 10)`**.
