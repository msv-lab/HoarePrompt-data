Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization**: The function begins by initializing a variable `total` to 0. This variable will hold the cumulative sum of the digits as they are processed.

2. **While Loop**: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. This ensures that it processes each digit of `n`.

3. **Digit Extraction and Summation**: Inside the loop:
   - The expression `n % 10` extracts the last digit of `n`.
   - This digit is then added to `total`.
   - The statement `n //= 10` effectively removes the last digit from `n` for the next iteration.

4. **Termination**: When `n` becomes 0, the loop exits. At this point, `total` contains the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the value of `total`, which represents the sum of the digits.

The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function behaves correctly for the given test cases, and it will work for any non-negative integer. If the input `n` is 0, the function returns 0, which is also correct as the sum of the digits of 0 is indeed 0.

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description, confirming its correctness.
