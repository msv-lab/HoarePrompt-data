To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the behavior of the loop in terms of `n` and `total`.

- **Initial State**: `n` is a non-negative integer; `total` is 0.
- The loop continues as long as `n > 0`.
- During each iteration, the last digit of `n` (given by `n % 10`) is added to `total`, and `n` is divided by 10 (effectively removing the last digit).

After all iterations of the loop have executed:
- **Final State of `n`**: `n` will be 0, as all digits of the original value of `n` would have been processed, and eventually removed through integer division by 10.
- **Final State of `total`**: `total` will be the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`.

To ensure the loop executed:
- The original value of `n` must have been greater than 0.

Thus, the output state incorporates these facts:

Output State: **'n' is 0, 'total' is the sum of all digits of the original value of 'n' (if original 'n' was greater than 0); if 'n' was 0 initially, 'total' remains 0.**
