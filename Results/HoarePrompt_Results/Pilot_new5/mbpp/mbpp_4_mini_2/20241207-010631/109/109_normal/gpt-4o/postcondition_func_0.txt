The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list that includes all elements of `list1` except the last one, concatenated with all elements of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it will return an empty list concatenated with `list2` and if `list2` is also empty, it will return all elements of `list1` except the last one. If both lists are empty, it returns an empty list.
