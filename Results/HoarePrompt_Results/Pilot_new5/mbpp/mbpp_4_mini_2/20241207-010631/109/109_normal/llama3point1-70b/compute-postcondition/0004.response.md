Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are both lists. If `list1` is non-empty, its last element is replaced by `list2`, while `list2` remains unchanged and `list1` is still a non-empty list. If `list1` is empty, then `list1` becomes equal to `list2`, containing the same elements as `list2`, and `list2` remains unchanged.***
