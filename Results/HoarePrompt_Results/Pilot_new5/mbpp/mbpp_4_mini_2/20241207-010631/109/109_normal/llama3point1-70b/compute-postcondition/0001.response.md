The code `list1[-1:] = list2` modifies the last element of `list1` to be the elements of `list2`. Since `list1` is a non-empty list, this means that the last element of `list1` will be replaced by the entire `list2` list.

- If `list2` is empty, the last element of `list1` will be removed.
- If `list2` has one or more elements, the last element of `list1` will be replaced with the first element of `list2` (if `list2` has at least one element).

The output state will reflect this change while keeping the other aspects of the initial state intact.

Output State: **`list1` is modified such that its last element is replaced by `list2`, `list2` remains unchanged, and `list1` is still a non-empty list.**
