Correctness: **False**.

The program incorrectly handles the case when `list1` is an empty list. When `list1` is empty and `list2` has elements, the line `list1 = list2` creates a new local reference to `list2`, but it does not modify `list1` in the caller's scope. Consequently, `list1` remains empty when it should be replaced by `list2`. 

For example:
- Input: `list1 = []`, `list2 = [1, 2, 3]`
- Expected output: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Actual output: `[]` (since `list1` remains unchanged) 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this potential case.
