Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character. It uses the `ord()` function, which is designed specifically for this purpose. Since the problem description specifies that the function should take a single character as input and return its ASCII value, the implementation meets all requirements. 

I cannot think of any potential cases where the function would not work as expected, as it handles valid single character inputs correctly. For example, if I input 'A', it returns 65, and if I input 'a', it returns 97. Thus, the function will work correctly for any valid single character input.
