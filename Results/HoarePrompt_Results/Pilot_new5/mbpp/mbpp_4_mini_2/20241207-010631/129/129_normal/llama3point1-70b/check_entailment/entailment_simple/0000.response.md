Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `char`, which is specified as being a single character string. This aligns with the problem description's requirement to find the ASCII value of a character.

2. **ASCII Value Calculation**: The function uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the character. The `ord()` function in Python is specifically designed to return the ASCII (or Unicode) value of a character, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

3. **Return Type**: The function's return type is an integer, as it returns the value produced by `ord()`, which is consistent with the specification in the docstring stating that the return value will be an integer representing the ASCII value.

Overall, since the function takes a single character as input and correctly returns its ASCII value, it fully adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
