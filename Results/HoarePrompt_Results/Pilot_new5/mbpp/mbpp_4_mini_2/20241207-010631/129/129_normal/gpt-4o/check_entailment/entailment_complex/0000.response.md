Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string. While the function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII (or Unicode code point) value for valid single character strings, it is vulnerable to errors if the input is either empty or contains more than one character. For example, calling `func_1('')` or `func_1('AB')` would lead to unexpected behavior, as those inputs do not comply with the requirement of a single character string. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential inputs.
