Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input character string is not a single character. The function `func_1` is expected to return the ASCII value of a single character, but if the input is an empty string or a string with more than one character, it will still attempt to call `ord(char)`, which will not behave as intended based on the problem description.

For example:
1. `func_1("")` would cause a ValueError since `ord()` expects a character and an empty string is not valid input.
2. `func_1("ab")` would return the ASCII value of the first character 'a' (97), which does not reflect the requirement of the function returning the ASCII value of a single character.

These cases demonstrate that the function does not cover all potential inputs as described in the problem statement, thus confirming its incorrectness.
