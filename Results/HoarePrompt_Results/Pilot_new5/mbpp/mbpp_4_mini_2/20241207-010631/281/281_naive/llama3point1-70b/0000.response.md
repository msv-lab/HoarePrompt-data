Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list and checks if it is even (i.e., if the number modulo 2 equals zero). This logic will work for all integer inputs, including negative numbers, zero, and large numbers. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
