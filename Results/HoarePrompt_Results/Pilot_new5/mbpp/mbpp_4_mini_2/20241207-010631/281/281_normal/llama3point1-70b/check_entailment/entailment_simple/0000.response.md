Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers, named `numbers`, as input and uses a list comprehension to iterate through each integer in the list. The condition `num % 2 == 0` checks if a number is even. If the condition is satisfied, the number is included in the resulting list.

Here are the reasons why the program is correct:

1. **Input Type**: The function is designed to accept a list of integers, which aligns with the problem description.
2. **Even Number Identification**: The program accurately identifies even numbers by checking the modulus of each number with 2. If the result is zero, the number is even.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list that contains all the even numbers from the input list, which is the expected output as per the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases: it will correctly return an empty list if there are no even numbers and will include all even numbers present in the input list. Thus, it fulfills the requirements of the problem description in every scenario.
