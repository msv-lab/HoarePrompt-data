Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find even numbers from a list of numbers. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(numbers)` takes a list of integers as input, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. For each `num`, it checks if `num % 2 == 0`, which is the condition for a number to be even.

3. **Returning Even Numbers**: The list comprehension constructs a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list, effectively fulfilling the requirement of the problem description.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test the function with multiple lists of integers, and in each case, the output matches the expected list of even numbers. This confirms that the function behaves as intended for those test cases.

Overall, the function accurately identifies and returns all even numbers from the input list, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
