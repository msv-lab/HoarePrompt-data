The provided program is a Python function designed to filter and return even numbers from a list of integers. 

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```

### Initial Assessment
The problem description specifies that the function should find even numbers from a list of numbers. The code utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over the `numbers` list and includes only those integers that are even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder). 

This approach seems to meet the requirements of the problem description. However, I should consider potential edge cases. For example:
- An empty list should return an empty list, which the code handles correctly.
- A list containing only odd numbers should also return an empty list, which the code handles correctly.
- A list with both odd and even numbers should return only the even numbers, also handled correctly.
- Negative even numbers should also be included, which is handled appropriately by the code.

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints state that the function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. This statement agrees with the logic of the code.

### Conclusion
Since the function correctly identifies even numbers from all potential cases (including the edge cases considered) and aligns with the output hints, I conclude that the function adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code is robust against various input scenarios, including empty lists, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with negative integers, which confirms its correctness in finding even numbers as described in the problem statement.
