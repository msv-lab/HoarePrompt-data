Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list of integers, which aligns with the problem's requirement to work with a list of numbers.

2. **Even Number Filtering**: The list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` effectively filters the input list to include only even numbers. This directly addresses the problem of finding even numbers from the provided list.

3. **Output**: The function returns a new list that contains the even numbers, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

4. **Behavior with Edge Cases**: While the program does not explicitly handle cases where the list might be empty or contain non-integer types, it naturally returns an empty list if there are no even numbers or if the input list is empty. This behavior is consistent with the expectation of returning a list of even integers.

In summary, the program correctly implements the functionality of finding and returning even numbers from a list, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
