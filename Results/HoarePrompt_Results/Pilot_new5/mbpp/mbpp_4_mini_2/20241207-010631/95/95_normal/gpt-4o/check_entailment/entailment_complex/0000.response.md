Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` takes a single argument `s`, which is a string, as required.
   
2. **Count Method**: The use of `s.count('std')` is appropriate and directly fulfills the requirement to count occurrences of the substring 'std'. The `count` method of a string in Python returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring, which is exactly what is needed here.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The comments in the code mention that the function does not specifically handle edge cases, such as when the input string is empty or when 'std' does not occur in the string. However, this is not an issue because the `count` method will correctly return 0 in these scenarios. For example:
   - If `s` is an empty string (`''`), `s.count('std')` will return 0, which is the expected outcome.
   - If 'std' does not exist in the string, `s.count('std')` will also return 0.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided check various cases, including multiple occurrences, single occurrences, and an empty string, all of which produce the expected results.

Since the function adheres to the problem description and behaves correctly under all tested scenarios, the overall conclusion is that the program is correct.
