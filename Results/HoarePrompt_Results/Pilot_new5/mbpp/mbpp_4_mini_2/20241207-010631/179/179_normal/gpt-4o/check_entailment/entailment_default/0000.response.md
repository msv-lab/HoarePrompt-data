The problem description specifies that the function should find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The provided code generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers and calculates the sum of their cubes. 

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the first `n` even natural numbers using the list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. For `n = 2`, it generates `[2, 4]`, for `n = 3`, it generates `[2, 4, 6]`, etc.
   - It then computes the cube of each even number and sums them, which adheres to the requirement of finding the cube sum.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - An important edge case to consider is when `n = 0`. The function does not handle this explicitly, but according to the output hints, it should return `0` since the sum of cubes of an empty list (which would be the case when there are no even natural numbers to sum) is indeed `0`.
   - If `n` is negative, the function will not behave correctly because the range will be invalid. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle negative inputs. If we assume `n` is always non-negative, then this is not an issue.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints state that if `n` is `0`, the function will return `0`, which is consistent with the understanding that the sum of cubes of an empty list is `0`. Thus, this hint agrees with the code's logic.
   - The output hints do not mention negative values, which is a potential issue if negative inputs were to be considered.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function appears to correctly implement the required functionality for non-negative integers, specifically returning the correct cube sum for the specified examples and handling `n = 0` correctly by returning `0`.
   - Given the assessment and the output hints, there is no valid input case where the function fails based on the description provided.

Correctness: **True**.
