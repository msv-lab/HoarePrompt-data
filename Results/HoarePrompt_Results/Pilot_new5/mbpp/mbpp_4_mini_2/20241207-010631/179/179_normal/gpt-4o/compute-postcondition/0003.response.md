The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even numbers, which are represented in a list as [2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]. The output of the function is `cube_sum`, which is the resulting sum. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even numbers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns the sum of the cubes of the first n even numbers.**
