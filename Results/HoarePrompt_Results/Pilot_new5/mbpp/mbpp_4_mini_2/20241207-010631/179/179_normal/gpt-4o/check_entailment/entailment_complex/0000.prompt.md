You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is the sum of the cubes of the first n even numbers, where even_numbers is a list containing the first n even numbers (i.e., [2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even numbers. If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, as the sum of cubes of an empty list is 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
