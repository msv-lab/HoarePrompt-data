#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is the sum of the cubes of the first n even numbers, where even_numbers is a list containing the first n even numbers (i.e., [2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even numbers. If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, as the sum of cubes of an empty list is 0.
