To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the problem description, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description:
The function must calculate the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
```
- The code uses a generator expression to iterate over even integers starting from 2 up to `2*n`. The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., up to `2*n`.
- It computes the cube of each even integer and sums them up using `sum()`.
- If `n` is 0, `range(2, 1, 2)` results in an empty range, so `sum()` returns 0, which is correct since there are no even integers to sum.

### Analysis:
1. **Even Natural Numbers**: The first `n` even natural numbers are 2, 4, ..., 2*n. The function correctly generates this sequence.
2. **Cube Calculation**: For each even number generated, it computes the cube, which aligns with the requirement to sum the cubes.
3. **Summation**: It sums these cubes correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It handles the case where `n` is 0 correctly as well, returning 0.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
