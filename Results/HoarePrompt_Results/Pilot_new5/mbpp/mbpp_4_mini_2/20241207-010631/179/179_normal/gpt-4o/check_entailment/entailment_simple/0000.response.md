To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the given requirements and the implementation.

**Problem Description:** We need to write a function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

**Annotated Program:**
```python
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
```

### Analysis of the Function:

1. **Generating Even Numbers:**
   - The line `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]` correctly generates the first n even natural numbers:
     - For `n=1`, it generates `[2]`
     - For `n=2`, it generates `[2, 4]`
     - For `n=3`, it generates `[2, 4, 6]`
     - For `n=4`, it generates `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - This is consistent with the definition of even natural numbers.

2. **Calculating the Cube Sum:**
   - The line `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` computes the sum of the cubes of the generated even numbers:
     - For `n=1`, it computes `2 ** 3 = 8`
     - For `n=2`, it computes `2 ** 3 + 4 ** 3 = 8 + 64 = 72`
     - For `n=3`, it computes `2 ** 3 + 4 ** 3 + 6 ** 3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`
     - For `n=4`, it computes `2 ** 3 + 4 ** 3 + 6 ** 3 + 8 ** 3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`
   - This matches the expected outputs given in the assertions.

3. **Assertions:**
   - The assertions provided at the beginning of the program (`assert func_1(2) == 72`, etc.) verify the correctness of the function for specific cases.

### Conclusion:

Since the implementation generates the first n even natural numbers correctly and computes their cube sum according to the problem description, the function adheres to the requirements specified.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified as follows:

Correctness: **True**
