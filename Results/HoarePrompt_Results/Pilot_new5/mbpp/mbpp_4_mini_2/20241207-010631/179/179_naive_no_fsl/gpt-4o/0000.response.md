To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to ascertain that it accurately calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   The first `n` even natural numbers are: 
   - For `n = 1`: [2]
   - For `n = 2`: [2, 4]
   - For `n = 3`: [2, 4, 6]
   - For `n = 4`: [2, 4, 6, 8]

   The cube of these numbers would be:
   - For `n = 1`: \(2^3 = 8\)
   - For `n = 2`: \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\)
   - For `n = 3`: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\)
   - For `n = 4`: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\)

2. **Examining the program**:
   The function `func_1(n)` generates the first `n` even natural numbers and calculates their cubes' sum:
   ```python
   even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
   cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))
   return cube_sum
   ```

   The assertions provided in the program correctly check the results for `n` equal to 2, 3, and 4:
   - `func_1(2)` returns 72.
   - `func_1(3)` returns 288.
   - `func_1(4)` returns 800.

3. **Testing edge cases**: 
   Let's consider a couple of edge cases:
   - If `n = 0`: The function should return 0 since there are no even natural numbers to sum. However, the program does not handle this case explicitly.
   - If `n = 1`: The function should return 8 as discussed.

   Given these edge cases:
   - For `n = 0`, the program will return `0`, which is reasonable since there are no even natural numbers to sum. However, it does not explicitly handle this case, which could lead to ambiguity.
   - For negative values of `n`, the program does not have restrictions, hence this will likely result in an empty list and return `0`, which is also not handled explicitly.

Since the function does not handle the case when `n` is zero or negative explicitly, it could be argued that it is partially correct depending on how one interprets the expected behavior of the function for these inputs.

Since the function fails to provide expected behavior for all potential cases, such as `n = 0`, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function should ideally return a defined value or raise an exception for inputs where `n` is less than or equal to 0 to be considered fully correct.
