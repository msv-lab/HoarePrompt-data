Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It does this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the input array and returning the difference between them. 

The assertions provided also test various cases:

1. For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`, resulting in a difference of `4`.
2. For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `9`, resulting in a difference of `8`.
3. For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `3`, resulting in a difference of `2`.

All of these cases correctly reflect the maximum difference as specified in the problem description. Since I cannot find any case where the function does not perform as expected, the program is confirmed to be correct.
