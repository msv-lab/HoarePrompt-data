Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It uses Python's built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to determine the largest and smallest elements in the array, respectively, and then calculates the difference between these two values.

The program will work correctly for the following cases:
1. **Empty array**: The program will raise a `ValueError` because both `max()` and `min()` cannot be called on an empty list. However, since the problem description does not specify handling for an empty array, this is not an issue regarding correctness in the context given.
2. **Single element array**: The difference will be `0` since `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` will return the same value.
3. **Multiple elements**: The program will correctly find the maximum and minimum values and compute their difference.

Since I cannot find an input case where the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.
