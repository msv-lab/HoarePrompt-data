The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it calculates the maximum value and the minimum value in the list `arr`, and returns the maximum difference between these two values, denoted as `max_diff`, which is equal to `max_val - min_val`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values found in that list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers arr and returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list.**
