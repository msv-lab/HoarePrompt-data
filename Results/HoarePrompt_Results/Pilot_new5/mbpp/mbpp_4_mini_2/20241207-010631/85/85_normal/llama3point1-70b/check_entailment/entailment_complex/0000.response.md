Correctness: **False**

The program is not correct because it does not handle the case where the input list `arr` is empty. According to the problem description, the function is required to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. However, if the input list is empty, the current implementation will raise a `ValueError` when trying to compute `max(arr)` and `min(arr)`.

The problem description implies that the function should be able to gracefully handle all cases, including an empty list, and provide a valid result. Since the function does not provide a result or handle the scenario of an empty list, it fails to meet the requirement stated in the problem description.
