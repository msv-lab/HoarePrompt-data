The value of `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`, where `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `low` is one more than the previous value of `mid`. Since the values of `arr`, `target`, `high`, and `mid` are not changed, they remain the same in the output state. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is equal to `mid + 1`, `high` must be less than or equal to `high, mid is equal to (low + high) // 2.**
