The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2`, it points to an element in `arr` that is less than `target`. Therefore, the new value of `low` will be `mid + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is equal to `mid + 1`, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is equal to (0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2, and `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`.**
