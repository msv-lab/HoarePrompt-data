The given program is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, upon reviewing the function `func_1`, it is evident that the function is intended to return the index of the last occurrence of the target number in the array, rather than the first occurrence as specified in the problem description.

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function uses a binary search approach where it continuously narrows down the range of indices to search for the `target`.
- When the `target` is found at `arr[mid]`, it sets `result` to `mid` and continues searching in the left half of the array by adjusting `high` to `mid - 1`. This ensures that the last occurrence of the target is recorded, not the first.
- The program will return the index of the last occurrence of `target` if found, or -1 if the `target` is not present in the array.

### Conclusion:
Since the problem description specifically asks for the index of the **first** occurrence of the target number, and the function is designed to return the index of the **last** occurrence, the program does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
