Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers and `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, and `high` remains equal to `len(arr) - 1`, while `result` is still -1, and `mid` is recalculated as (0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2, maintaining that `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, while `low` remains 0, `result` is still -1, and `mid` is recalculated as (0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2, maintaining that `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`.***
