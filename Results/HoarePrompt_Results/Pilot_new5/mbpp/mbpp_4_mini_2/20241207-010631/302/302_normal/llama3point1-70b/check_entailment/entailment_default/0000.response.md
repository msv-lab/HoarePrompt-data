The code provided in the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through the sorted array `arr` and checks each element against the target number `num`. If it finds a match, it returns the index of that first occurrence. If the number is not found, it returns -1, which matches the expected behavior outlined in the problem description.

Next, we need to consider the edge case where the input array `arr` is empty. The output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where `arr` is empty, but it will correctly return -1 in such instances. This statement implies that the function will indeed return -1 when given an empty list, which is the correct and expected behavior according to the problem description. Therefore, this hint aligns with the functionality of the code.

Thus, the function appears to handle all specified cases correctly, including the scenario of an empty input array.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array as described in the problem statement. It will return -1 if the number is not present, and the behavior with an empty list is also correct.
