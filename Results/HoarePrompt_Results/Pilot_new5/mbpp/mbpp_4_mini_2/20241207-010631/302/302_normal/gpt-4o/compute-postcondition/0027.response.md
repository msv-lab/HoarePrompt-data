The value of `high` is updated to be `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, and since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, after the assignment, `high` will be one less than the current value of `mid`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `high` is equal to `mid - 1`.**
