`result` is assigned the value of `mid`. The variable `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and since no changes are made to `arr`, `target`, `low`, or `high`, their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` is equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `result` is equal to `mid`**.
