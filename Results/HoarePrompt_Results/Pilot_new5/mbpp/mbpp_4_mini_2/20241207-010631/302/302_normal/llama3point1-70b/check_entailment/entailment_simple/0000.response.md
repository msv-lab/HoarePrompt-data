Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Specifications**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num`, which is an integer whose first occurrence we want to find in `arr`.

2. **Logic of the Function**: 
   - The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through each element of the sorted array `arr` along with its index using `enumerate()`.
   - During each iteration, it checks if the current element `x` is equal to `num`. 
   - If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index `i` of that first occurrence.

3. **Handling Absence of `num`**: 
   - If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function returns `-1`, indicating that `num` is not present in the list, which is consistent with the requirement that we should return a negative value when the number is not found.

4. **Correctness with Sorted Arrays**: 
   - Since `arr` is guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order, the implementation is correct as it will always find the first occurrence of `num` if it exists.

Thus, the function meets all the requirements of the problem description: it finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array correctly and handles the case where the number is not present.

Therefore, the program is correct as it adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.
