Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it fulfills the task:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. The goal is to find the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`.

2. **Iteration through the list**: The function uses a for loop with `enumerate` to iterate through each element of `arr`. It checks each element `x` to see if it matches `num`.

3. **Return condition**: If a match is found (i.e., `x == num`), the function immediately returns the index `i` of that occurrence. This ensures that it always returns the index of the first occurrence, as required.

4. **Handling absence of `num`**: If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function returns `-1`, which indicates that `num` is not present in `arr`. This behavior is also in line with the problem requirements.

5. **Edge case for empty arrays**: The function effectively handles the case where `arr` is empty. In such a case, the for loop will not execute, and the function will return `-1`, which correctly indicates that `num` is not found.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and correctly handles various scenarios, including the case when the array is empty or when `num` is not present. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
