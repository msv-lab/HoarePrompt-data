Let's analyze the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description and output hints.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The problem requires a function to find the index of the **first occurrence** of a given number in a sorted array. The examples given indicate that the function should return the index of the first instance of the target number if it exists, or -1 if it does not.

### Program Analysis:
Here's the provided function:
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1  # This ensures we continue searching to the left for the first occurrence
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

The logic of the function correctly handles finding the first occurrence of the target number by:
1. Using binary search to efficiently locate the target.
2. Updating `result` whenever a match is found, and then adjusting `high` to `mid - 1` to ensure that we continue searching to the left of the current mid element.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints state that the function returns the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr`, which is misleading. The function is actually designed to find the first occurrence due to the manipulation of `high` when a match is found.

### Consistency Check:
There is a contradiction between the output hints and what the function is intended to do:
- The hints say it returns the index of the last occurrence, but the function is intended to return the first occurrence.
- Thus, if the output hints are taken at face value, they suggest that the function does not fulfill the problem's requirement of returning the first occurrence.

### Conclusion:
The function does indeed attempt to find the first occurrence of the target, but the output hints incorrectly state that it finds the last occurrence. This inconsistency indicates that the function does not meet the problem description as a whole if we strictly adhere to the hints.

Therefore, the assessment concludes that the function does not satisfy the problem requirements correctly given the misleading hints.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function aims to find the first occurrence of the target, but the output hints state that it finds the last occurrence, leading to confusion and indicating a failure to adhere to the problem description accurately.
