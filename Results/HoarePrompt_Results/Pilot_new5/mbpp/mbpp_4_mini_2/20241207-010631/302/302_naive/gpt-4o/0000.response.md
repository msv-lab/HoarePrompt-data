Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted array. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The `func_1` function initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, which represent the current search range in the array.
2. It uses a `while` loop to continue searching as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
3. Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and checks if the number at that index (`arr[mid]`) is equal to the target.
   - If it is equal, it updates `result` with `mid` and continues searching in the left half of the array (`high = mid - 1`) to ensure it finds the first occurrence.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, it narrows the search to the right half of the array by updating `low`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, it narrows the search to the left half by updating `high`.
4. The function finally returns the index of the first occurrence of the target, or `-1` if the target is not found.

The assertions provided before the function also validate that the function returns the expected indices for the target values in the sorted arrays, confirming the correctness of the implementation for those test cases. 

Since all potential cases (such as duplicates and edge cases) are handled correctly, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
