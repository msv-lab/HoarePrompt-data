Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

### Explanation:
1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` uses a binary search approach, which is appropriate since the array is sorted. The primary goal is to find the first occurrence of the target number.
2. **Logic**:
   - The `result` variable is initialized to `-1`, which will be used to indicate that the target is not found if it remains unchanged.
   - The search continues while `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - If the middle element `arr[mid]` equals the target, the index is stored in `result`, and the search continues by adjusting `high` to `mid - 1` to potentially find an earlier occurrence.
   - If the middle element is less than the target, the search space is adjusted to the right half of the array by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, the search space is adjusted to the left half of the array by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the target is not present by returning `-1`.
   - It also correctly identifies the first occurrence in arrays with duplicates, as demonstrated in the test assertions.

All provided test cases match the expected outputs, and I cannot identify any edge case where the function fails based on the problem description. Hence, the code is correct.
