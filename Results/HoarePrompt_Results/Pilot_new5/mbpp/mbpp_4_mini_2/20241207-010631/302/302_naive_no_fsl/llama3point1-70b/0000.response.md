Correctness: **True**

The provided program iterates through the sorted array and returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified number. If the number is not found, it returns -1. 

Key points regarding the correctness:
1. The function correctly uses a loop to go through each element of the array.
2. When it finds the target number (`num`), it returns the index of that occurrence immediately, ensuring it is the first match.
3. If the number is not present in the array, it correctly returns -1, indicating that the number does not exist in the array.

Since the array is sorted, the program's logic effectively meets the requirement of finding the first occurrence. There are no edge cases that are not handled, such as:
- An empty array, which will correctly return -1.
- A number at the beginning, middle, or end of the array, which will all be handled appropriately.

Thus, based on the problem description and the implementation, the code works correctly for all relevant cases.
