Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not address the scenario when the list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should check whether every odd index contains odd numbers. However, in the case of an empty list, there are no indices to check, and the function will return `True` by default, which is misleading. An empty list can be argued to not violate the condition, but it does not explicitly fulfill the requirement of checking every odd index, as there are none to check. Thus, it fails to meet the requirement of the problem description for this edge case.
