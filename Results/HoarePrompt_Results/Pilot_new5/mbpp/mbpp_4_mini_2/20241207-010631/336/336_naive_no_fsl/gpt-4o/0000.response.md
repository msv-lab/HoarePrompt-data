Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` checks whether every odd index of the given list contains odd numbers. However, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the list is empty. When an empty list is passed to the function, it would return `True` since there are no odd indices to check, but this does not meet the expectation set by the problem description, which implies that all odd indices must contain odd numbers. 

For example:
```python
assert func_1([]) == False  # This case should return False, but it will return True instead.
```

Thus, the function does not correctly handle all potential cases as outlined in the problem description.
