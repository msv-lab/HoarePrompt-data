To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem description:** 
The task is to check whether every odd index in the given list contains odd numbers.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

**Analysis:**
1. The loop iterates through all indices of the list `lst`.
2. For each index `i`, it checks:
   - If `i` is an odd index (`i % 2 != 0`)
   - If the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`)
3. If both conditions are satisfied, it returns `False`, indicating that there's at least one odd index that does not contain an odd number.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such instance, it returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices contain odd numbers.

**Potential Cases:**
To check for the correctness, let's consider a few cases:

- If `lst` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
  - At index 1 (odd), the value is 2 (even) → should return `False`.

- If `lst` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`:
  - At index 1 (odd), the value is 3 (odd) → continues checking.
  - At index 3 (odd), the value is 7 (odd) → should return `True`.

- If `lst` is `[0, 2, 4, 6]`:
  - At index 1 (odd), the value is 2 (even) → should return `False`.

- If `lst` is `[1]`:
  - No odd indices to check → should return `True`.

- If `lst` is `[]` (empty list):
  - No odd indices to check → should return `True`.

**Conclusion:**
The program behaves as expected for the above cases. However, there is an edge case to consider:

- If the list contains non-integer types (e.g., strings or floats), the program would raise a `TypeError`. For example:
  - If `lst` is `[1, 'a', 3]`, at index 1, it would try to evaluate `'a' % 2`, which is invalid.

Since the program does not handle such cases and can break with non-integer inputs, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
