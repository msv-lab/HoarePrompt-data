The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function evaluates the contents of the list through a series of checks, returning `False` if any of the conditions in Cases 1, 2, or 3 are met. If none of those conditions are met and the checks complete successfully, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list contains at least 2 integers with all integers at odd indices being odd. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `True` if the list meets certain conditions regarding its contents; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns True if the list contains at least 2 integers and all integers at odd indices are odd; otherwise, it returns False.**
