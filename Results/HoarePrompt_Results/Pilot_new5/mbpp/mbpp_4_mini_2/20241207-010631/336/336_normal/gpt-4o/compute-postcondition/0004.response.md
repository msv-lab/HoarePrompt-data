According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst`. The loop starts at index `1` and increments `i` by `2` each time, meaning it will access the odd indices of `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`, which means the next value of `i` will be `3`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `lst` must have at least `4` integers since the loop will attempt to access `lst[3]`. At this point, `lst` contains at least 2 integers and the integer at index `1` is odd. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, the conditions are:
- `lst` must have at least `4` integers.
- The value of `i` becomes `3`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that contains at least 4 integers, `i` is 3, and the integer at index `i` of `lst` is at least 3.**
