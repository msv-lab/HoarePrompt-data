To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both.

### Problem Description:
The function needs to check whether every odd index of a given list contains odd numbers. This means that for any index `i` in the list, if `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`), then `lst[i]` must also be odd (`lst[i] % 2 != 0`).

### Program Analysis:
Let's look at the provided program:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    return True
```

1. The program iterates over each index `i` of the list `lst`.
2. It checks if `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
3. If `i` is odd and the number at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), it returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any odd index containing an even number, it returns `True`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic as follows:
- It checks every odd index.
- It verifies that each number at these indices is odd.
- If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`, which aligns with the requirement.
- If no even numbers are found at odd indices, it returns `True`.

**Conclusion:** The program does exactly what the problem description asks for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
