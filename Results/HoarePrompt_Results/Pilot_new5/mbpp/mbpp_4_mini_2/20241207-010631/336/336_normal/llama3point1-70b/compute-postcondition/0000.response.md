According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. The loop will execute if the length of `lst` is at least 1. At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0, and it will iterate up to `len(lst) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `lst` must not be empty, and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
