The code defines a set `months_with_30_days` that contains the months with 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). This does not change the initial state of the variable `month`, which is still an integer in the range from 1 to 12, inclusive. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`month` is an integer in the range from 1 to 12, inclusive; `months_with_30_days` is {4, 6, 9, 11}.**
