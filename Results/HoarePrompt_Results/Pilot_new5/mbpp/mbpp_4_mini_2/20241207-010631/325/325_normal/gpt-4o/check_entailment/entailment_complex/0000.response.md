Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description. According to the problem description, the function must check whether the given month number (from 1 to 12) has 30 days. The months that contain 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

However, there are a couple of issues with the implementation:

1. The assertions provided in the code do not cover all months. Specifically, the assertion `assert func_1(2) == False` checks February, which indeed has 28 or 29 days (but is not relevant to the requirement of having 30 days). The function should return `False` for February, which is correct. However, it also needs to handle the other months (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) correctly by returning `False` for those as well.

2. The function directly checks if the month is in the `months_with_30_days` set. While this part is correct, it does not handle cases for months outside the valid range of 1 to 12. If a user passes an invalid month (e.g., 0 or 13), the function will incorrectly return `False` instead of potentially raising an error or defining specific behavior for invalid input.

Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and does not handle all edge cases specified in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it does not meet the requirements correctly for every potential case.
