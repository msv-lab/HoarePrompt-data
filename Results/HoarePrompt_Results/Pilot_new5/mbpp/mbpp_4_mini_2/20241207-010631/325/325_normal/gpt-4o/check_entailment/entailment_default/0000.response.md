To evaluate the provided program against the problem description and output hints, letâ€™s break down the requirements and the implementation.

**Problem Description:** The function should check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that contains 30 days. 

**Program Code:**
```python
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
```

**Output Hints:** The function accepts an integer `month` and returns True if it corresponds to a month with 30 days (April, June, September, November); otherwise, it returns False.

### Initial Assessment:

1. **Checking Month Numbers:**
   - The function defines a set `months_with_30_days` containing the months 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), and 11 (November).
   - The function checks if the given `month` is in this set and returns `True` if it is; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - For input 6, it should return `True` (June has 30 days).
   - For input 2, it should return `False` (February does not have 30 days).
   - For input 12, it should return `False` (December does not have 30 days).

### Edge Cases:
- The function does not handle invalid inputs such as numbers outside the range 1-12. For instance:
  - If `month` is 0 or 13, the function would return `False`, but according to the problem description, months should only be within 1 to 12. 

### Output Hints Evaluation:
The output hints state that the function correctly identifies the months with 30 days. They align with the code's logic as they mention that it returns `True` for April, June, September, and November, and `False` otherwise. 

### Conclusion:
The code works correctly for the valid inputs of 1 to 12 as it correctly identifies the months with 30 days based on the set defined. However, it fails to handle the edge case of invalid month numbers (e.g., 0 or 13), which should not be considered valid inputs according to the problem description.

Thus, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically regarding valid month numbers, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**.
