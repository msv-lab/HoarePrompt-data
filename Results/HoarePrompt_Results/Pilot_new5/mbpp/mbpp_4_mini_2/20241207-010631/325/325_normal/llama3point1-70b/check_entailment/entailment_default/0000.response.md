The task requires a function that checks whether a given month (represented as an integer from 1 to 12) has 30 days. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

The provided program checks if the input month is in a predefined list of months that have 30 days:

```python
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
```

### Initial Assessment:
The function correctly identifies the months that have 30 days by checking if the month is in the list `[4, 6, 9, 11]`. However, the program does not account for out-of-bounds inputs (e.g., if someone inputs 0 or 13), as it assumes the input will always be a valid month number between 1 and 12.

### Output Hints:
According to the output hints, the function returns `True` for months 4, 6, 9, and 11, and `False` for all other valid months. The hints also state that the function does not have additional error handling for inputs outside the 1-12 range, which implies that the function may not be robust against unexpected inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle edge cases where the input month is less than 1 (e.g., 0) or greater than 12 (e.g., 13). Thus, it could return `False` for invalid inputs without any indication that the input was out of bounds. Since the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to lack of error handling, the correctness of the program is in question.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function fails to account for out-of-bounds month numbers (e.g., 0 or 13), which is a potential case that could cause the program to return misleading results.
