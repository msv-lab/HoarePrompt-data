Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the given month number contains 30 days. According to the problem description, months 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), and 11 (November) have 30 days, which the program correctly identifies. However, it fails to handle the following edge cases:

1. It does not account for invalid month numbers, such as `0` or `13`, which are outside the range of valid month numbers (1 to 12). For these inputs, the function should ideally return `False` since they do not correspond to any real month.

2. It does not return `False` explicitly for input months that do not have 30 days, such as `1` (January), `3` (March), `5` (May), `7` (July), `8` (August), `10` (October), `12` (December). While the function returns `False` for these numbers implicitly because they are not in the `thirty_days_months` list, the function could provide clearer return values for all valid month inputs.

For example, calling `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` would return `False`, but these are not valid inputs as per the problem description. 

Thus, the program does not meet the complete requirements laid out in the problem description, resulting in a determination of correctness being **False**.
