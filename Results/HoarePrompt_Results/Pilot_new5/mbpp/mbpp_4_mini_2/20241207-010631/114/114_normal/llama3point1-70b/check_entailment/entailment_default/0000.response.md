The program provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and uses the built-in `.count()` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. 

Upon reviewing the problem description, the code correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The built-in `.count()` method is specifically designed for this purpose, and it will handle various data types as elements within the tuple, including integers, strings, lists, or even other tuples.

Next, looking at the output hints, they state that the function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` of any data type, then returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This aligns perfectly with the implementation of the function, confirming that the output hints accurately reflect the functionality of the code.

Considering both the problem description and the output hints, there aren't any edge cases or scenarios indicated where the function would fail to work as expected. The `.count()` method will correctly account for all instances of `elem`, including cases where `elem` does not exist in `tup`, in which case it will return `0`.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases and effectively counts occurrences of the specified element in the tuple.
