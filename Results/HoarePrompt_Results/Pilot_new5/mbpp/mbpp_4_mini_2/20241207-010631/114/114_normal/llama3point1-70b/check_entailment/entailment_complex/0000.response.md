Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`. It uses the built-in method `count()` of the tuple, which accurately counts the occurrences of the specified `elem` within `tup`.

Hereâ€™s why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a tuple (`tup`) and any element (`elem`), adhering to the requirement that `elem` can be of any data type. This versatility allows for counting occurrences of integers, strings, floats, and other data types.

2. **Counting Logic**: The method `tup.count(elem)` directly returns the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`, which is precisely what the problem description asks for.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns this count as an integer, which is the expected output according to the problem.

Since the program consistently satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem description for all potential input cases, it is deemed correct.
