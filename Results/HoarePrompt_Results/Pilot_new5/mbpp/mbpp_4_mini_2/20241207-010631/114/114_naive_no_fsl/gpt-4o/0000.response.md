Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as arguments and uses the `count` method of the tuple to determine the number of occurrences of the specified element in that tuple.

The assertions given in the program demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for multiple test cases:
1. It returns `0` when counting the occurrences of `4`, which is not in the tuple.
2. It returns `3` for the element `10`, which appears three times in the tuple.
3. It returns `4` for the element `8`, which appears four times in the tuple.

Since the function correctly handles these cases and the logic is robust for counting the occurrences of any element in a tuple, there are no identified edge cases or missing logic. Therefore, the function is correct for the provided problem description.
