Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The problem description states that the function must remove "all whitespaces" from a string. However, the implementation of `func_1(s)` only removes spaces (the `' '` character) by using `s.replace(' ', '')`. 

This approach fails to remove other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`'\t'`), newlines (`'\n'`), and other whitespace characters defined by Unicode. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirement of removing all whitespace characters from the input string. 

For example, if the input string contains a tab or newline character, those characters would not be removed, and the output would not be as expected. Hence, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
