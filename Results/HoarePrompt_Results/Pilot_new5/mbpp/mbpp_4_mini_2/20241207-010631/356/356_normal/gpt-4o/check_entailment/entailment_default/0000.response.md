The function `func_1` is designed to remove all whitespaces from a string. The code uses the `replace` method to replace spaces with empty strings, effectively removing them. 

Initial assessment based on the problem description:
- The function aims to remove all whitespaces from a string. However, it only replaces spaces (' ') and does not account for other types of whitespace characters, such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or any other whitespace characters that may be present in the input string. Thus, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

Now analyzing the output hints:
- The output hints state that the function "removes all whitespace characters" but the implementation only addresses spaces. This discrepancy suggests that the output hints are inaccurate with respect to what the code actually does.

Given this analysis, the code does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case since it fails to remove all whitespace characters present in the string. For instance, if the input string contained tab characters or newlines, they would remain in the output.

Correctness: **False**. 
The function does not handle cases where the string contains whitespace characters other than spaces, which contradicts the problem description.
