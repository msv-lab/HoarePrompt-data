Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which states that the function must remove all whitespaces from a string. The implementation of the function `func_1(s)` only replaces space characters (' ') with an empty string, effectively removing regular spaces but neglecting other whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and other forms of whitespace.

For example, if the input string is:
- `s = "python\tprogram"` (which includes a tab character), the function would return `python\tprogram`, leaving the tab intact. This means that not all whitespace characters are being removed, which contradicts the requirement to remove "all whitespaces" from the string.

Since the program does not correctly handle all types of whitespace, it does not fulfill the problem description as required.
