You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as length multiplied by width, where length and width are non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, both of which are expected to be non-negative integers or floats. It calculates and returns the area of a rectangle by multiplying `length` by `width`. However, the function does not handle negative input values or check for invalid data types, so if negative values or non-numeric types are passed, it may lead to erroneous results or exceptions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
