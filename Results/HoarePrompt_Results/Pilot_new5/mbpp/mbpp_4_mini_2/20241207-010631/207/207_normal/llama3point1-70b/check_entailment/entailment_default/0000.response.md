The code provided is a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. 

Initially assessing the code based on the problem description, it seems to correctly implement the calculation of the area. However, it's crucial to consider edge cases, such as:

1. Negative values for length or width: The area should not be calculated with negative dimensions, as it is physically meaningless and would lead to erroneous results.
2. Non-numeric inputs: If the function receives non-numeric types (like strings or None), it would raise a `TypeError` since multiplying non-numeric types would not yield a valid area.

Now, examining the output hints, they state that the function expects both parameters to be non-negative integers or floats and that it does not handle negative inputs or invalid data types. This agrees with the initial assessment of the code's limitations, confirming that the function lacks necessary input validation.

Since the function does not account for negative values or non-numeric types, it fails to follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not handle negative input values or check for invalid data types, which could lead to erroneous results or exceptions when such inputs are provided. For example, calling `func_1(-5, 10)` would return -50, which is incorrect for an area calculation.
