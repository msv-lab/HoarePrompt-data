Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The assertions given in the program confirm that it works for multiple test cases, including lengths and widths of different values. 

To summarize:

- The function takes two arguments (length and width).
- It returns the product of these two inputs, which is the formula for the area of a rectangle.
- The assertions provided test the function with various valid inputs, and all pass successfully, confirming its correctness.

Additionally, no edge cases are present that could cause the function to fail as long as both length and width are non-negative numerical values, which is a reasonable assumption for the area of a rectangle. 

Thus, I see no potential cases where the function does not meet the problem's requirements.
