Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the parity of `n` is odd. 

Here's the breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function accepts an integer `n`, which aligns with the problem statement.
2. **Operation**: The expression `n % 2 != 0` checks if `n` is not divisible by 2. In mathematical terms, this means that if `n` is odd (i.e., has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2), the expression evaluates to `True`. If `n` is even, it evaluates to `False`.
3. **Output**: The function returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, which directly corresponds to determining the parity of the number.

Since the function accurately identifies whether the parity of the given integer is odd, it fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is validated.
