Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`) and `False` if `n` is even. 

The assertions provided in the code test the function with the following inputs:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct since 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True`, which is correct since 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False`, which is correct since 10 is even.

Since all assertions are satisfied and the function handles the parity check correctly for the tested cases, the program is correct for this problem description. There are no potential cases identified where the program fails to meet the requirements.
