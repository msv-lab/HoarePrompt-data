Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. It uses the modulo operator `%` to check if `n` is not evenly divisible by 2, which accurately identifies odd numbers. The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function returns `True` for odd numbers (like `7`) and `False` for even numbers (like `12` and `10`). Since the logic holds for all integers, including edge cases like negative numbers or zero (where `0` would return `False` and negative odd numbers would return `True`), the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
