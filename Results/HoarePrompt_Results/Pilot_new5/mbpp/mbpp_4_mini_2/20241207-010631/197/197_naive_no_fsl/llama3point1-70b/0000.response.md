To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its function against the problem description: counting the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

The program defines a function `func_1(tup, lst)` that does the following:
1. For each element in the list `lst`, it uses `tup.count(element)` to count how many times that element appears in the tuple `tup`.
2. It sums these counts to return the total number of occurrences of all elements in `lst` within `tup`.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and whether the code handles them correctly:

1. **Empty Tuple and Empty List**: 
   - Input: `func_1((), [])`
   - Expected Output: `0` (since both the tuple and the list are empty)
   - The code should return `0`, which it does.

2. **Empty Tuple with Non-empty List**:
   - Input: `func_1((), [1, 2, 3])`
   - Expected Output: `0` (since the tuple is empty, there are no occurrences)
   - The code returns `0`, which is correct.

3. **Tuple with No Matching Elements**:
   - Input: `func_1((4, 5, 6), [1, 2, 3])`
   - Expected Output: `0` (none of the elements in the list exist in the tuple)
   - The code returns `0`, which is correct.

4. **Tuple with Some Matching Elements**:
   - Input: `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), [2, 3])`
   - Expected Output: `3` (2 appears twice and 3 appears once)
   - The code returns `3`, which is correct.

5. **All Elements in the List Present in Tuple**:
   - Input: `func_1((1, 1, 1, 2, 2), [1, 2])`
   - Expected Output: `5` (1 appears three times and 2 appears twice)
   - The code returns `5`, which is correct.

6. **Handling Non-hashable Types**: 
   - Input: `func_1((1, 2, 3), [[1], [2], [3]])`
   - This will raise a `TypeError` because lists are not hashable and cannot be counted.

Given the analysis above, we can conclude that the code does not handle the case where the elements in the list are non-hashable (like lists themselves). Thus, the function would raise an error in such cases instead of returning a count.

Correctness: **False** 

Explanation: The code fails with non-hashable types in the list, such as lists themselves or dictionaries, which means it does not correctly count occurrences for all possible inputs as required by the problem description.
