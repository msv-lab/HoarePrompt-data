The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of how many times each element in `lst` appears in `tup`. This includes handling cases where `lst` may contain elements not present in `tup`, as they will contribute a count of 0. The function does not handle empty inputs explicitly but will return 0 if `lst` is empty, as there are no elements to count.
