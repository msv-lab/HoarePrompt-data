The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elements`. `tup` is a tuple, and `elements` is a list containing elements that may be present in `tup`. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of occurrences of each element in `elements` that are found in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and return the total count of how many times the elements in `elements` appear in the tuple `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup (a tuple) and a parameter elements (a list), returning the sum of occurrences of each element in elements found in tup.**
