Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, returning the total count of how many times each element in `elements` appears in `tup`. It counts occurrences for all elements in `elements`, including duplicates, but does not handle cases where `elements` might be empty, in which case it will return 0, which is a valid outcome.**
