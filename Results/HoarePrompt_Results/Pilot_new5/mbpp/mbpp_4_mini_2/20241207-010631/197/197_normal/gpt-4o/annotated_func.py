#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and elements is a list containing elements that may be present in tup.
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
    return count
    #The program returns the sum of occurrences of each element in 'elements' found in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, returning the total count of how many times each element in `elements` appears in `tup`. It counts occurrences for all elements in `elements`, including duplicates, but does not handle cases where `elements` might be empty, in which case it will return 0, which is a valid outcome.
