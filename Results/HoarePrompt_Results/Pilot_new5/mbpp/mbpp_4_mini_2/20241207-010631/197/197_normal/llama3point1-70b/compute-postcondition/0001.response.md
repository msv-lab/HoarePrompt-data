The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `lst`. `tup` is a tuple, and `lst` is a list. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of the counts of each element in the list `lst` that is found in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and return the total count of occurrences of elements from `lst` that are present in `tup`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the sum of the counts of each element in `lst` found in `tup`.**
