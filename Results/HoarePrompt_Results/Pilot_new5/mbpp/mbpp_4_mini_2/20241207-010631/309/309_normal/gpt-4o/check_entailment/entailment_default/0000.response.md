To determine the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1`, we will first analyze the problem description and the code itself.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem states that we need to write a function to check whether all characters in a string are the same. 

### Code Analysis
The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(s):
    if not s:
        return True
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
    return True
```
- If the string `s` is empty, the function returns `True`. 
- If the string is non-empty, it checks each character against the first character. If any character is different, it returns `False`. If all characters match, it returns `True`.

### Edge Case Consideration
1. An important edge case is when the string is empty. The problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle empty strings. The function currently returns `True` for an empty string, which is debatable.
2. However, the output hints state that the function does not handle the case of an empty string correctly. It suggests that the function should not return `True` for an empty string, implying that the expected behavior for an empty string is to return `False`.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints state:
- The function accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, it returns `False.
- It does not handle the case of an empty string correctly, as it only checks if `s` is not empty at the start and doesn't return a value for that case.

### Conclusion
The hints indicate that the function does not rightly handle the case of an empty string. Since the problem description is ambiguous about how to treat an empty string, the function's handling of it (returning `True`) contradicts the output hints which suggest it should return `False`. 

Thus, the function does not meet the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to correctly address the case of an empty string according to the hints provided, indicating a lack of adherence to the problem requirements.
