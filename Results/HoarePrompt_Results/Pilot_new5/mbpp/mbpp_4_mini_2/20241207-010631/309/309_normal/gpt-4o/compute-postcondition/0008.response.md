According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with a length greater than 0, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the same as `first_char`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `char` would then take the value of the next character in the string after `first_char`.

State: **`s` is a string with a length greater than 1, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character in the string**
