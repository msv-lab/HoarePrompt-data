Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to check whether all characters in a given string are the same. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(s)` utilizes the `set()` function to create a set of characters from the string `s`. A set inherently removes duplicate values. If all characters in the string are the same, then the set will contain exactly one unique element.

2. **Return Value**: The expression `len(set(s)) == 1` checks if the length of the set is 1. This will only be true if all characters in the string are identical. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all characters are the same, and `False` otherwise.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function also handles edge cases correctly. For instance:
   - If the input string is empty (though the problem states that `s` has at least one character), the set would be empty, and `len(set(s))` would be 0, returning `False`.
   - If the string consists of a single character (e.g., "a"), the set will contain one element, and the function will return `True`.

Overall, since the function satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
