To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the program.

### Problem Description:
The function must check whether all characters in a given string are the same or not.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Function Signature**: `def func_1(s):`
   - The function takes a single string argument `s`.

2. **Initial Check**: 
   ```python
   if (not s):
       return True
   ```
   - The function checks if the string is empty. If it is empty, the function returns `True`. 
   - This is problematic because an empty string does not have all characters the same, so it should return `False` instead.

3. **Character Comparison**:
   ```python
   first_char = s[0]
   for char in s:
       if char != first_char:
           return False
   ```
   - The function initializes `first_char` to the first character of the string and then iterates through each character in the string comparing it with `first_char`.
   - If any character differs from `first_char`, it returns `False`, indicating not all characters are the same.

4. **Final Return**:
   ```python
   return True
   ```
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it returns `True`, indicating all characters in `s` are the same.

### Conclusion:
The key issue arises from the function's handling of empty strings. According to the problem description, an empty string should not be considered as having all the same characters. Therefore, the function should return `False` for empty strings.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program does not handle the case of an empty string correctly. 

Therefore, the conclusion is:
Correctness: **False**
