Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between the two input lists. It converts both lists into sets to utilize the set intersection operation, which efficiently finds common elements. The resulting set is then converted back into a sorted tuple. The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. 

There are no missing logic or edge cases that could lead to incorrect results based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
