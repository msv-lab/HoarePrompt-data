Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are both lists. It returns a tuple containing the intersection of the elements from the two lists, meaning it includes only the elements that are present in both lists. If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple. **
