Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two lists. It converts both input lists into sets, computes the intersection (shared elements) using the `&` operator, and then returns the common elements as a sorted tuple.

The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function works correctly for the specified test cases. Additionally, the function will work for any other valid inputs, including:

- Empty lists (e.g., `func_1([], [])` returns `()`)
- Cases where one list is completely contained in the other (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4])` returns `(1, 2, 3)`)
- Lists with no common elements (e.g., `func_1([1, 2], [3, 4])` returns `()`)

Since the function handles these cases and adheres to the problem description, the correctness is confirmed to be true.
