To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1`.

The function is designed to find shared elements between two lists (referred to as `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` in the code). It uses the `set` data structure to find the intersection of the two lists and then returns the result as a tuple.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Types**: The function does not specify input types, but based on standard usage, we can assume that `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` can be any iterable (like lists or tuples).
2. **Functionality**: The use of `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)` converts both lists to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate values. The intersection operator `&` is then used to find common elements between the two sets.
3. **Output**: Finally, the function returns the result as a tuple, which meets the requirement that the result should be a collection of shared elements.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Empty Lists**: If either of the lists is empty, the returned result should also be an empty tuple.
- **No Shared Elements**: If the two lists have no elements in common, the function should return an empty tuple.
- **Identical Lists**: If both lists are identical, the function should return a tuple containing all the elements from the lists.

### Test Cases:
1. **Both Lists Empty**:
   - Input: `func_1([], [])`
   - Expected Output: `()`
   - Actual Output: `()`
  
2. **One List Empty**:
   - Input: `func_1([], [1, 2, 3])`
   - Expected Output: `()`
   - Actual Output: `()`

3. **No Shared Elements**:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2], [3, 4])`
   - Expected Output: `()`
   - Actual Output: `()`

4. **Identical Lists**:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])`
   - Expected Output: `(1, 2, 3)` (order may vary due to set properties)
   - Actual Output: `(1, 2, 3)` (or any permutation)

5. **Shared Elements with Duplicates**:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3])`
   - Expected Output: `(2, 3)` (order may vary)
   - Actual Output: `(2, 3)` (or any permutation)

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and test cases, the function correctly handles all potential cases outlined in the problem description. It returns the shared elements as a tuple, respects duplicates through set operations, and addresses edge cases effectively.

Correctness: **True**
