Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. 

While the code correctly iterates through the sorted array in reverse to find the last occurrence of the specified `target`, the comments suggest that there may be behavior related to returning not just the last index but possibly the second-last or third-last index under certain conditions. However, the actual code only returns the last index of `target` or -1 if not found. 

The discrepancy between the comments and the logic in the code indicates a lack of clarity and correctness in the implementation. The problem description clearly states that the function must find the last position of an element in a sorted array, but the way the comments are structured could lead to misunderstandings about the intended functionality of the program. 

Additionally, the function's behavior could be perceived as ambiguous due to the misleading comments, and thus it fails to meet the expectations of the problem description in a clear and unambiguous way.
