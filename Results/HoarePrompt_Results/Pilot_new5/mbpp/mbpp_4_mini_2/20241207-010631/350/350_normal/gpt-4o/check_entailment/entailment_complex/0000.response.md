Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the specifications:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the last position (index) of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. It correctly handles the requirement to search for the last occurrence of `x`.

2. **Iteration from End**: The function iterates through the array `arr` starting from the last index down to the first index. This approach ensures that the function can locate the last occurrence of `x` effectively.

3. **Return Value**: When the function finds an occurrence of `x`, it immediately returns the index. If the loop completes without finding `x`, it returns `-1`, indicating that `x` is not present in the list.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function is robust in handling edge cases, such as:
   - When `x` is the first element or the last element in the list.
   - When `x` appears multiple times in the list, the function will always return the last index.
   - If `x` is not present in the list at all, it correctly returns `-1`.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions provided at the beginning of the program serve as tests that demonstrate the functionâ€™s correctness for various scenarios, including cases where `x` is present multiple times and where it is absent.

Overall, the function reliably fulfills the requirements set out in the problem description, making it correct.
