According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index of `arr` minus 1 (len(arr) - 2). If the loop runs again, `i` will be decremented by 1, so it will be `len(arr) - 2 - 1`, which is `len(arr) - 3`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 0, meaning that `len(arr)` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 3 elements, `i` is len(arr) - 3**
