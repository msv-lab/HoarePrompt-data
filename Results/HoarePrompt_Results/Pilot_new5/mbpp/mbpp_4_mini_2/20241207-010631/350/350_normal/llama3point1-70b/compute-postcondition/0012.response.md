The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function returns:

- Case 1: The last index `i` of the list `arr` where the current value equals `target`, indicating that `target` is present at the last position of the sorted list.
- Case 2: The last index `i` of the list `arr`, where `i` is `len(arr) - 2` and the last element of `arr` at that index is not equal to `target`.
- Case 3: The value of `i`, which is the length of `arr` minus 3, where `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 3 elements.
- Case 4: -1, indicating that the target integer is not found in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and return the last index of `target` if found, the index of the second last element if the last element is not equal to `target`, the index of the third last element if the list has at least three elements, or -1 if `target` is not in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`, returning the last index of `target` if found, the index of the second last element if the last element is not equal to `target`, the index of the third last element if the list has at least three elements, or -1 if `target` is not in the list.**
