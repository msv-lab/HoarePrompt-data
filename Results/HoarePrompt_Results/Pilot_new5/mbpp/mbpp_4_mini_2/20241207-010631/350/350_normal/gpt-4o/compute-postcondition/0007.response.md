According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as the index `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop is iterating from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`, which means in the next iteration it will be decremented to `len(arr) - 3`. 

Given that `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order containing at least 2 integers, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `0`. As `i` is currently `len(arr) - 2`, for the loop to run again, `i` will be `len(arr) - 3`, and `arr` will still be a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that contains at least 2 integers, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 3`**
