According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the array. The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.

Since `i` is currently `len(arr) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be decremented to `len(arr) - 2`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be greater than or equal to 0; thus, `len(arr)` must be at least 2 so that `len(arr) - 2` is a valid index.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`**
