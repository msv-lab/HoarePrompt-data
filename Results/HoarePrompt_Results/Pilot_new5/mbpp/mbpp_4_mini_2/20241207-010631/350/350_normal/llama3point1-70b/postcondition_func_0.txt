The function accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It returns the index of the last occurrence of `target` if found. If `target` is not found, it returns -1. The comments incorrectly suggest returning the second last or third last index under certain conditions, but the actual code does not implement this behavior.
