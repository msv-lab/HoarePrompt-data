The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `x`. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on certain conditions:

- In Case 1, if the conditions are met, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, indicating the position of the last element in the sorted list `arr`.
- In Case 2, the function returns the value of `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 2`, applicable when `arr` contains at least 2 integers.
- In Case 3, the function returns the value of `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 3`.
- In Case 4, the function returns -1, indicating that the value `x` is not found in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`, and return specific indices based on the conditions outlined, or -1 if `x` is not present in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`, and returns an index based on conditions or -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`.**
