Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's the explanation of why the code works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Iterating from the End**: The function iterates through the array starting from the last element and moving backward. This ensures that the first time it finds the target, it is indeed the last occurrence.

2. **Return Statement**: As soon as it finds the target element, it returns the index. If the target is not found after checking all elements, it returns -1, which is the expected behavior if the element is not present in the array.

3. **Sorted Array Handling**: Although the problem specifies a sorted array, the implementation does not rely on the sorting property to locate the last position; it checks each element in reverse order, making it valid regardless of the sorting of the array.

Considering these points, the function behaves correctly for various scenarios, including:
- The target is present at the end of the array.
- The target is present at the beginning of the array.
- The target is present multiple times.
- The target is not present in the array.
- The array is empty.

Thus, I cannot find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected given the problem description.
