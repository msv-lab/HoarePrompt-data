Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst, tpl)` correctly adds the given tuple to the given list. It converts the tuple into a list using `list(tpl)` and then concatenates it with `lst` using the `+` operator. The provided assertions confirm that the function works for those specific cases:

1. `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`
2. `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`
3. `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`

Since there are no apparent edge cases or alternative scenarios that the program fails to handle, the implementation is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
