Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description requires the function to add the contents of a tuple to a list, but the function provided returns a new list that combines the original list and the elements of the tuple converted into a list. 

The issue lies in the word "add." In many programming contexts, "add" implies modifying the original list in-place (i.e., appending elements to it), rather than returning a new list. The current implementation returns a new list instead of modifying the original `input_list`. 

Additionally, there is no operation within the function that directly modifies `input_list` itself. Although it returns the correct representation of the combined values, it does not fulfill the intent of "adding" the tuple to the existing list.

For example, if `input_list` is `[1, 2]` and `input_tuple` is `(3, 4)`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, but it does not modify `input_list` to become `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which would be the more expected behavior if using "add" in an in-place sense.

Thus, the function does not strictly adhere to the requirements of the problem description, and therefore, the correctness evaluation is false.
