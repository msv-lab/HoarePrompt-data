Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl` converted into a list. It does not handle any edge cases related to the types of elements in the list or tuple, assuming they are compatible for concatenation.**
