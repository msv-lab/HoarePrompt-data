Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description states that the function should "add the given tuple to the given list," which implies that the function should modify the original list in place by adding the elements of the tuple to it.

However, the annotated program returns a new list that combines `input_list` and the elements of `input_tuple`, rather than modifying `input_list` directly. This behavior does not satisfy the requirement of adding the tuple to the list, as it does not change the original list and instead creates a new list.

For example, if the input is `input_list = [1, 2]` and `input_tuple = (3, 4)`, the program will return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, but `input_list` will remain unchanged as `[1, 2]`. This indicates that the function does not fulfill the intent of "adding" the tuple to the list as specified in the problem description. 

Thus, the function does not behave as required, making it incorrect.
