Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as input parameters and returns a new list that combines the elements of the input list with the elements of the input tuple, which is done by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it to the input list.

Here are the reasons why the program is correct for all potential cases:

1. **Empty List and Tuple**: If both the input list and tuple are empty (`func_1([], ())`), the result will be an empty list, which is expected.

2. **Non-Empty List and Empty Tuple**: If the input list is non-empty and the tuple is empty (`func_1([1, 2, 3], ())`), the output will be the original list `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

3. **Empty List and Non-Empty Tuple**: If the input list is empty and the tuple is non-empty (`func_1([], (4, 5, 6))`), the output will be the elements of the tuple as a list `[4, 5, 6]`, which is also correct.

4. **Non-Empty List and Non-Empty Tuple**: For a non-empty list and a non-empty tuple (`func_1([1, 2], (3, 4))`), the function correctly combines both to return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

5. **Different Data Types**: The function will handle tuples and lists containing different data types (e.g., strings, numbers, etc.) without any issues.

Since the program behaves correctly for all these cases and meets the problem description requirements, it is deemed correct.
