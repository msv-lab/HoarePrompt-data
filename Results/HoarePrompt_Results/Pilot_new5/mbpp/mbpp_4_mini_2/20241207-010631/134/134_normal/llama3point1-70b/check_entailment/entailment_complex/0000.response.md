Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement from the problem description by defining a function that takes a positive integer `n` and computes the sum of the even index binomial coefficients. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Specification**: The function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input. The annotated comments confirm that `n` is assumed to be a positive integer before the function call, which satisfies the problem's requirements.

2. **Sum of Even Index Binomial Coefficients**: 
   - The program uses a `for` loop that iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive). 
   - It checks if the index `i` is even (`if i % 2 == 0`), and if so, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the cumulative `sum`. 
   - This correctly implements the requirement to sum the binomial coefficients at even indices.

3. **Return Value**: After the loop, the program returns `sum`, which by the end of the loop contains the total of all binomial coefficients at even indices from 0 up to `n`. 

4. **Annotation Accuracy**: The annotations provided in the code are consistent and accurately describe the states of variables and what the function ultimately computes. The final comment confirms that the function achieves the stated goal of summing combinations of the even index, which aligns with the problem description.

Overall, every aspect of the function is carefully constructed to meet the specified requirements, ensuring that it correctly computes the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for the provided positive integer `n`.
