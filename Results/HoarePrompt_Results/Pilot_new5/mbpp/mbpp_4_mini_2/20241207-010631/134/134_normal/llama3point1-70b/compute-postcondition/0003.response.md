In this case, `sum` is assigned the value of `sum + math.comb(n, i)`. The function `math.comb(n, i)` computes the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose `i` elements from `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 0 (an even number), `math.comb(n, 0)` will always return 1, since there is exactly one way to choose 0 elements from any set.

So, the update to `sum` will be:
- The previous value of `sum` is 0.
- `math.comb(n, 0)` computes to 1.

Thus, `sum` becomes `0 + 1`, leading to `sum` being 1.

The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 0, and `i` is an even number (i % 2 == 0)**
