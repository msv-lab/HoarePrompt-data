To determine the correctness of the provided program, we analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description, which requires checking if a number is undulating.

### Definition of Undulating Numbers:
An undulating number is defined as a number where the digits alternate, meaning:
- The first digit must not be the same as the second.
- The digits at even indexes (0-based) should be the same as the first digit.
- The digits at odd indexes should be the same as the second digit.

### Examination of the Program:
The program starts by converting the integer `n` into a string `s` for easier digit manipulation. It performs the following steps:
1. Checks if the length of the string representation of `n` is less than 3, returning `False` if so.
2. It stores the first and second digits and checks if they are equal, returning `False` if they are.
3. It then iterates over the remaining digits, ensuring that even-indexed digits match the first digit and odd-indexed digits match the second digit.
4. If all conditions are met, it returns `True`.

### Testing Cases:
- `func_1(1212121)` should return `True` (it alternates between 1 and 2).
- `func_1(1991)` should return `False` (the digits do not alternate correctly).
- `func_1(121)` should return `True` (it alternates between 1 and 2).

### Potential Edge Case:
Consider the input `func_1(111)`. This number has three digits, but they are all the same. According to the rules of undulating numbers, this should return `False` because the first digit (1) is the same as the second digit (1), violating the requirement for the first two digits to be different.

This test case shows that the program does not correctly handle input where all digits are the same, even if the length condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
Since we have identified a case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
