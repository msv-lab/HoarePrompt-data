Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string with at least 4 characters, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i` is 4, and `i` is even while `s[i]` is not equal to `first_digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no return value from the function.***
