The variable `first_digit` is assigned the value of the first character of the string `s`, which represents the integer `n`. Since `s` is the string representation of a positive integer `n`, and its length is at least 3, `first_digit` will be the first character of `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`.**
