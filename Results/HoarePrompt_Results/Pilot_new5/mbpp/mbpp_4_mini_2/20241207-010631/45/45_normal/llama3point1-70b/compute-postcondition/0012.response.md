The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `undulating` is False, `i` is `len(n) - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
