Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits. If the digit at index `i` is part of an undulating sequence (either increasing or decreasing), `undulating` remains True. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
