You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3.
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the comparison of `first_digit` and `second_digit` is false, even though their current values are equal.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`; `second_digit` is the second character of `s`; the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`.
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer; `s` is a string with an even length; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`; `second_digit` is the second character of `s`; `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`; `i` is the length of `s` (which is even); all characters at even indices of `s` are equal to `first_digit`; all characters at odd indices of `s` are equal to `second_digit`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that the conditions of the string 's' are met, where all characters at even indices are equal to 'first_digit' and all characters at odd indices are equal to 'second_digit', with 'first_digit' not equal to 'second_digit'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if it has at least 3 digits. If it does not, it returns False. If it does, it checks that the first two digits are different and confirms that all characters in the string at even indices are equal to the first digit and all characters at odd indices are equal to the second digit. The function returns True only if all these conditions are satisfied; otherwise, it returns False. If the string representation of `n` has an even length, it will only validate characters against the first and second digits.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
