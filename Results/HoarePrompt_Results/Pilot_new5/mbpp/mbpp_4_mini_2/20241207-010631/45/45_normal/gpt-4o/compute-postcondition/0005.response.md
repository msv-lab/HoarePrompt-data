The variable `second_digit` is assigned the value of the second character in the string `s`. Since `s` is the string representation of the positive integer `n`, the value of `s` will have its second character correspond to the second digit of `n`, assuming `n` has at least two digits. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`; and `second_digit` is the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`; `second_digit` is the second character of `s`.**
