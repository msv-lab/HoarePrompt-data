Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string with at least 4 characters, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, and `i` is 3. Since `i` is odd, the program does not return False, and the output remains False.***
