Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly filters a dictionary based on the values compared to the integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary that only contains key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

Hereâ€™s why the function works correctly for all potential cases:

1. If the dictionary is empty, it will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected behavior.
2. If all values in the dictionary are less than `n`, the function will return an empty dictionary, which is also correct.
3. If some values are equal to or greater than `n`, it will include those key-value pairs in the result.
4. The function handles any type of comparable value (as long as they can be compared to an integer) and works for various dictionary structures.

Since there are no identified edge cases where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, the implementation is correct.
