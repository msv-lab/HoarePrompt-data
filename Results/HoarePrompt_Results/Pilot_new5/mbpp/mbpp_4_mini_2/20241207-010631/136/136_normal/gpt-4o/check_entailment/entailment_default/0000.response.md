The provided program aims to filter a dictionary based on whether its values are greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`. The implementation uses a dictionary comprehension to achieve this.

Examining the problem description and the code:
- The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs.
- It returns a new dictionary containing only those key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
1. If the input dictionary `d` is empty, the expected output should be an empty dictionary, which is correctly handled by the comprehension returning an empty dictionary.
2. If `n` is negative, all positive integers in the dictionary will be included, and this is also correctly handled.
3. If all values in the dictionary are less than `n`, the output should be an empty dictionary, which is also correctly handled.

Now let's review the output hints:
- They state that the function returns a dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, and also that it returns an empty dictionary if `d` is empty.

The output hints align perfectly with the function's logic. The function correctly filters the dictionary according to the given criteria and handles all the mentioned edge cases appropriately.

Since I cannot find any example or case where the code does not work as expected according to the problem description, and the output hints agree with the code's functionality, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
