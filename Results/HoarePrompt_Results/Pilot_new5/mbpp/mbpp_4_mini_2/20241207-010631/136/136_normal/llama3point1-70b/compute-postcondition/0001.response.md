The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `d`, which is a dictionary with values that are integers, and a parameter `n`, which is an integer. After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary containing keys from `d` where the corresponding values are integers that are greater than or equal to the integer `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and return a new dictionary with keys from `d` that have values greater than or equal to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter d (a dictionary with integer values) and a parameter n (an integer), and returns a dictionary with keys from d where the values are greater than or equal to n.**
