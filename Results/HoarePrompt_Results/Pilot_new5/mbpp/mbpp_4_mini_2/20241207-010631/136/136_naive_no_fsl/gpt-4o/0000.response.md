Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and filters the dictionary to include only those entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

The provided assertions test the function with several inputs:
1. For the first assertion, the function is tested with `n = 170`, and it correctly returns entries with values 175, 180, and 190.
2. The second assertion checks with `n = 180`, and it returns the correct entries with values 180 and 190.
3. The last assertion uses `n = 190`, and it correctly returns only the entry with the value 190.

The function uses a dictionary comprehension that accurately filters the input based on the specified condition (`v >= n`). 

I couldn't think of any potential edge cases or inputs that would lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all tested scenarios and meets the requirements in the problem description.
