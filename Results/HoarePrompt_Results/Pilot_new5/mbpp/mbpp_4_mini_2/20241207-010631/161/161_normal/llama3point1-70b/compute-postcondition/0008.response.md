The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, where `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. Therefore, after the assignment, `a` becomes 1 and `b` becomes 2 + 1 = 3. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the first value of the loop iteration is still 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1 and at least 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, the first value of the loop iteration is 2.**
