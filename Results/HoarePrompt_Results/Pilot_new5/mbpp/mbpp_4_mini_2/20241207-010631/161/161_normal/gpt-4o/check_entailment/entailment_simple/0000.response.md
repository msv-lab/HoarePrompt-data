Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the calculation of the n-th Lucas number as specified in the problem description. Instead, it mistakenly calculates the n-th Fibonacci number. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:
1. The Lucas numbers are defined similarly to the Fibonacci numbers, but with different initial conditions:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

2. The program correctly returns 2 for the input `0` and 1 for the input `1`, which aligns with the Lucas number definition.

3. However, the computation in the `for` loop does not correctly compute the next Lucas number (it computes Fibonacci numbers instead). It initializes `a` and `b` to the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1) but uses a logic that ultimately produces the Fibonacci sequence.

4. The provided assertions also verify against incorrect expected values for the Lucas sequence:
   - For `n = 9`, the correct Lucas number is 76, which is expected, but this is coincidentally correct due to the wrong implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.
   - For `n = 4`, the expected Lucas number is 7, which is again correct, but this is due to the erroneous logic that produces the Fibonacci numbers.

Thus, while it may return correct values for some inputs, the underlying logic does not reflect the requirements of the Lucas number sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
