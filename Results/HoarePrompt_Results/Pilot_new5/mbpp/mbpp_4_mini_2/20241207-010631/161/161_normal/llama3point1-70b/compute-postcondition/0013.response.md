To analyze the provided code and determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider how the values of `a` and `b` change throughout the loop. 

Initially:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.
- `a` starts at 2.
- `b` starts at 1.

The loop iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), which means it will execute `n - 1` times. 

The relationship established in the loop is:
- In each iteration, `a` takes the value of `b` (the previous `b`), and `b` takes the value of the sum of the original `a` and `b`.

After analyzing the iterations:
- After the first iteration (when `_` is 2), `a` becomes 1 (the original value of `b`), and `b` becomes 3 (the original values of `a + b` which is 2 + 1).
- After the second iteration (when `_` is 3), `a` becomes 3 (the previous value of `b`), and `b` becomes 4 (1 + 3).
- After the third iteration (when `_` is 4), `a` becomes 4 (the previous value of `b`), and `b` becomes 7 (3 + 4).

Continuing this process, we can see that `b` is effectively generating a Fibonacci-like sequence, starting from initial values of 2 and 1 (ignoring the first 2 iterations for the Fibonacci sequence).

After all iterations of the loop execute `n - 1` times:
- `a` will hold the (n-1)th value of the sequence, and `b` will hold the nth value of the sequence.

To summarize:
- If the loop executes `n - 1` times, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- After completing the loop:
  - `a` will be the (n-1)th value in this new series.
  - `b` will be the nth value in this new series.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the (n-1)th value of the sequence defined by the loop, `b` is the nth value of the sequence defined by the loop.**
