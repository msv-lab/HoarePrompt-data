Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to find the n-th Lucas number based on the provided problem description. Let's break down how it meets the requirements:

1. **Lucas Numbers Definition**: The Lucas numbers are defined similarly to the Fibonacci sequence but with different initial values. The first two Lucas numbers are L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, and for n â‰¥ 2, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2).

2. **Implementation**:
   - For `n == 0`, the function correctly returns 2, which is the first Lucas number.
   - For `n == 1`, it correctly returns 1, which is the second Lucas number.
   - For `n >= 2`, the function initializes `a` and `b` to the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1, respectively) and iteratively computes the subsequent Lucas numbers using the relation L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2).

3. **Logic Flow**: The program uses a for loop to calculate the Lucas numbers starting from 2 up to n, ensuring that it covers all non-negative integers. The variable `b` holds the current Lucas number being computed and is returned as the result after the loop.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description by correctly implementing the logic to compute the n-th Lucas number for all non-negative integers n.
