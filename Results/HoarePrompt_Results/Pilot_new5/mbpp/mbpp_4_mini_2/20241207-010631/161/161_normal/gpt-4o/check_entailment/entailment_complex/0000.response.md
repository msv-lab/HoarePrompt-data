The provided program is intended to calculate the n-th Lucas number, as specified in the problem description. However, upon reviewing the implementation, it becomes clear that the function does not fulfill this requirement.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Lucas Numbers Definition**: The Lucas numbers form a sequence similar to the Fibonacci numbers, where:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The function correctly returns 2 for `n = 0` and 1 for `n = 1`, which aligns with the Lucas number definition.
   - However, for `n > 1`, the function computes what it describes as the n-th Fibonacci number instead of the n-th Lucas number. The Fibonacci series begins with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., while the Lucas series is 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ...

3. **Incorrect Logic for n > 1**: 
   - The loop calculates Fibonacci numbers by initializing `a` and `b` to 2 and 1, respectively. The variables `a` and `b` are then updated in a way that does not reflect the Lucas number generation.
   - Specifically, `a` and `b` should be updated based on the Lucas numbers rather than Fibonacci numbers.

4. **Failure to Meet Problem Description**: The program fails to produce correct outputs for inputs such as `n = 2` (it should return 3 for Lucas but would return 2) and higher values like `n = 3` (it should return 4 for Lucas but would return 4 for Fibonacci).

Based on this analysis, the program does not meet the problem description requirements.

Correctness: **False**
