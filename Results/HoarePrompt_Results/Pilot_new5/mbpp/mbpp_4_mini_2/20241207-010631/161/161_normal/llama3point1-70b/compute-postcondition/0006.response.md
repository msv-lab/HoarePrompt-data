The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the constants 2 and 1, respectively. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b`, while keeping the condition of `n` intact.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1**
