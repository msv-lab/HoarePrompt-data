The code snippet `a, b = b, a + b` will swap the values of `a` and `b`, and at the same time, set the new value of `b` to be the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`. 

Initially, we have:
- `a` is 3
- `b` is 4

Following the code execution, `a` will take the value of `b`, which is 4, and `b` will take the value of `a + b`, which is `3 + 4 = 7`.

Thus, after execution:
- `a` becomes 4
- `b` becomes 7

The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `n must be greater than 4` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7**
