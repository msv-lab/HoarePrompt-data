Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The function `func_1` correctly handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For values of `n` greater than 1, it uses a loop to calculate the n-th Lucas number by maintaining two variables, `a` and `b`, which represent the two preceding numbers in the sequence. This implementation correctly computes the Lucas number for any non-negative integer input.

I cannot find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct.
