Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly calculate the n-th Lucas number for all potential input cases. Specifically, the assertion `assert func_1(9) == 76` is expected to pass, but if we evaluate `func_1(9)`, we find that it actually returns `46`, which is incorrect according to the Lucas number sequence. 

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The program accurately calculates the Lucas numbers for smaller values of n (0 to 8), but it fails for n = 9. The correct value for L(9) should be 76, not 46. Therefore, the code does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
