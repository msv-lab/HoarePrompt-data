To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the implementation of the function `func_1` which is intended to calculate the n-th Lucas number.

The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n > 1, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

The assertions given in the program are:
- `func_1(9) == 76`
- `func_1(4) == 7`
- `func_1(3) == 4`

Now, verifying the function against the Lucas sequence:
- L(0) = 2 (Correct)
- L(1) = 1 (Correct)
- L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3 (Not directly checked but correct)
- L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4 (Matches the assertion)
- L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7 (Matches the assertion)
- L(5) = L(4) + L(3) = 7 + 4 = 11 (Not directly checked)
- L(6) = L(5) + L(4) = 11 + 7 = 18 (Not directly checked)
- L(7) = L(6) + L(5) = 18 + 11 = 29 (Not directly checked)
- L(8) = L(7) + L(6) = 29 + 18 = 47 (Not directly checked)
- L(9) = L(8) + L(7) = 47 + 29 = 76 (Matches the assertion)

Now let's check if there are any edge cases or potential issues:
1. **Negative Values**: The function does not handle negative inputs. If we call `func_1(-1)`, it will not return a valid output.
2. **Non-integer Inputs**: The function does not validate the type of `n`. If it receives a float or a string, the program will raise an error.
3. **Large Values**: Although the current implementation can calculate large values, it would be prudent to test boundary values. However, that does not strictly negate correctness, since the function operates correctly for non-negative integers based on the logic.

Since the function fails to handle negative inputs and non-integer types, it does not meet the requirement of being correct for "every potential case."

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it does not handle negative inputs, which should be considered as an invalid case. For example, calling `func_1(-1)` will not give a valid output according to the definition of the Lucas numbers.
