The provided program is intended to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the implementation does not actually meet the requirement stated in the problem description.

The function `func_1` uses `set(lst)` to remove duplicate elements from the list, and then it calculates the sum of these unique elements. However, this approach does not correctly identify non-repeated elements. For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`. The sum of these non-repeated elements should be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`. However, the function would return `21` because it includes `1` once as part of the unique set, which is incorrect as `1` is repeated.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements.

Correctness: **False** 

An example where the program does not work correctly is with the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, where the expected output is `20`, but the program would output `21`.
