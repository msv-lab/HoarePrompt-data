To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and how the code behaves.

**Problem description:** The task is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

**Analysis:**
1. The code uses a generator expression to iterate through each element `i` in the list `lst`.
2. For each element, it checks if its count in the list is exactly 1 using `lst.count(i)`.
3. If the element is non-repeated (count equals to 1), it is included in the sum.
4. Finally, the function returns the sum of all such elements.

**Potential Cases to Consider:**
1. An empty list `[]`: The sum of non-repeated elements should be `0`. The code would correctly return `0`.
2. A list with all repeated elements, e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`: The sum of non-repeated elements should again be `0`. The code would correctly return `0`.
3. A list with a mix of repeated and non-repeated elements, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`: The only non-repeated element is `3`, so the sum should be `3`. The code would correctly return `3`.
4. A list with non-repeated elements only, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`: The sum should be `6`. The code would correctly return `6`.

**Edge Cases:**
- The performance of `lst.count(i)` could be inefficient for large lists because it iterates through the list for each element, which could lead to a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case. However, the problem description does not specify performance constraints, so this does not affect correctness.

Given that the function correctly sums non-repeated elements in all potential cases reviewed and adheres to the problem description:

Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all tested cases.
