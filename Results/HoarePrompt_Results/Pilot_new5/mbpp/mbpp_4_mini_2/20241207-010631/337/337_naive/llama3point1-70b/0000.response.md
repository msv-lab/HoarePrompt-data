Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate through each element in the list and sums only those elements whose count is exactly one. This means it effectively filters out any repeated elements.

For example, for the input list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4]`, the non-repeated elements are `[3, 4]`, and the sum would be `3 + 4 = 7`. The program handles all potential cases correctly, including empty lists and lists with all repeated elements, and as such it adheres to the problem description.
