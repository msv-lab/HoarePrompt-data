The provided Python function `func_1` is intended to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. 

Upon initial examination of the code:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```
The function uses a generator expression to iterate through each element `i` in the list `lst`, checking if the count of that element is equal to 1. It sums up those elements that are unique (i.e., appear exactly once).

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
1. An empty list: The function would return 0 because `sum([])` is 0.
2. A list where all elements are repeated (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`): The function would return 0.
3. A list with a mix of repeated and non-repeated elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3]`): It would return 4 (1 + 3).
4. A list with negative numbers and non-repeated elements (e.g., `[-1, -1, 2]`): It would return 2.

The output hints state that the function will return 0 if there are no unique integers, and since the sum of an empty list is also 0, the function would handle an empty input appropriately.

Examining the output hints:
- The hints confirm that the function returns the sum of integers that appear exactly once in the list.
- They also state that the function does not explicitly handle empty lists but will return 0, which is consistent with the behavior of the `sum()` function in Python.

Both the problem description and the output hints align with the code functionality. I cannot find any input cases where the function would fail to meet the description's requirements.

Therefore, the code appears to correctly handle all defined cases as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly sums the elements that occur exactly once in the list, returns 0 for empty lists, and behaves as expected based on the problem description and output hints.
