#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of unique integers in the list 'lst', where each integer appears exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of integers that appear exactly once in the list. If there are no unique integers, it returns 0. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty explicitly, but in such cases, it will also return 0 as the sum of an empty list is 0.
