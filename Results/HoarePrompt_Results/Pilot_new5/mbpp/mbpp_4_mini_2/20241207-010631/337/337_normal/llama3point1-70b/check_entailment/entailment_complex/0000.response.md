Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and calculates the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in that list. 

Here's the explanation of why it meets the problem description:

1. The function uses a generator expression to iterate through each element `i` in the list `lst`.
2. It checks the condition `lst.count(i) == 1`, which ensures that the element `i` appears exactly once in the list.
3. The `sum` function then computes the total of these unique elements.
4. As a result, if there are no unique integers, the sum would naturally be 0, which is correctly handled by the `sum` function when applied to an empty input.

Since the function meets the requirement of summing only the non-repeated elements, it satisfies the problem description effectively. Therefore, the correctness of the program can be affirmed.
