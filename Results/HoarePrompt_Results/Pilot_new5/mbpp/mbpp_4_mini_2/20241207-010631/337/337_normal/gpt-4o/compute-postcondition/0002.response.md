The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` as a parameter. It calculates and returns the sum of unique integers found in that list by first converting the list to a set, which removes any duplicates, and then calculating the sum of the resulting unique integers. The functionality does not account for any non-integer values that might be present in the list, which could lead to a TypeError if such values exist. However, the provided annotations accurately describe the function's purpose as it sums the unique integers from the input list.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of the unique integers from that list. Note that if the list contains non-integer values, a TypeError may occur. **
