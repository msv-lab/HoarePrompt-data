According to the code, this is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to run indefinitely unless interrupted by a break statement or an exception. Since there are no conditions in the loop that would prevent it from executing again, the program state does not need to be modified for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 8, if `func_1(num)` returns true, then `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
