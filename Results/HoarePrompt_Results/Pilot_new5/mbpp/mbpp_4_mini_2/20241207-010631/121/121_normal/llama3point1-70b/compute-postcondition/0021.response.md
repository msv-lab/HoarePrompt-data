Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 or 3; `num` is 8. If `func_1(num)` returns true, then `count` is updated to 3, and if `count` becomes equal to `n`, the function returns the value of `num`, which is 8. If `count` is not equal to `n`, no value is returned. If `func_1(num)` returns false, the state remains unchanged.***
