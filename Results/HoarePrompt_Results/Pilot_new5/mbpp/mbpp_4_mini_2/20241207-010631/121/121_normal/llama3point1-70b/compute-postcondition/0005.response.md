The variable `num` is assigned the value `7`. The initial states of `n` and `count` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State retains both the original conditions for `n` and `count`, while updating the value of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 7**
