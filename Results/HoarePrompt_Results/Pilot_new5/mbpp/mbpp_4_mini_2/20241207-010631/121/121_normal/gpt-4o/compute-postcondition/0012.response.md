In the given code, the values of `S0` and `S1` are updated based on the assignment `S0, S1 = S1, S_next`. This means `S0` will take the value of `S1`, which is currently 7, and `S1` will take the value of `S_next`, which is currently 17. 

The initial values are:
- `S0` is 3
- `S1` is 7
- `S_next` is 17

After the execution of the code:
- `S0` will be updated to the value of `S1`, which is 7.
- `S1` will be updated to the value of `S_next`, which is 17.

The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 7, `S1` is 17, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 7, `S1` is 17, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**.
