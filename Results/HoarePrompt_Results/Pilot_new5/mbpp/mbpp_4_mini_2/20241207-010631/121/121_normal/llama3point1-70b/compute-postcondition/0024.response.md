The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` is either 2 or 3, after the execution, `count` will be either 3 or 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 3 or 4; `num` is 9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 3 or 4; `num` is 9**.
