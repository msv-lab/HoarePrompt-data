`S_next` is assigned the value of `2 * S1 + S0`. The values of `S0` and `S1` are both 1, leading to the calculation: `S_next = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3`. The variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, and `S_next` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**.
