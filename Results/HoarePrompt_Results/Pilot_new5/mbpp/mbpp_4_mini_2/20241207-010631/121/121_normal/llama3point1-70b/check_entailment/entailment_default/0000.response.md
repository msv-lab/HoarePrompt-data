To evaluate the provided code against the problem description, let's break down the functions step-by-step.

### Function Analysis

**Function 1: `func_1`**
```python
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
- **Description**: This function checks if a number `n` is prime.
- **Logic**: 
  - Returns `False` for numbers less than 2.
  - Checks for factors from 2 to the square root of `n`.
  - Returns `True` if no factors are found and `n` is prime.
  
**Output Description**: The hints correctly describe this function's behavior, noting the handling of non-negative integers and the focus on prime checking.

**Function 2: `func_2`**
```python
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
```
- **Description**: This function finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
- **Logic**:
  - Returns 7 for `n == 1`.
  - Iterates from 7, checking if each number is prime and if it is 1 or 5 modulo 6.
  - If both conditions are met, it increments the count until it reaches `n`, at which point it returns the found prime.

**Output Description**: The hints align with the code, stating that the function calculates primes starting from 7 and checks specific conditions to return the nth prime.

### Edge Case Considerations
1. **Initial Input**: The function `func_2` assumes `n` is positive but does not explicitly handle cases where `n <= 0`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function will enter an infinite loop since it won't hit the return condition for positive integers.
2. **Prime Numbers**: The logic for checking the condition of being 1 or 5 modulo 6 is correct for Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, but since `func_1` is only checking for primes from 7 upwards, it does not handle the scenario where it may encounter numbers before 7, which could potentially cause issues if modified or used incorrectly.

### Conclusion
While the functions appear to implement the functionality as described, the lack of handling for non-positive integers in `func_2` leads to potential infinite loops or incorrect behavior. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, which could lead to infinite loops in the `func_2`.
