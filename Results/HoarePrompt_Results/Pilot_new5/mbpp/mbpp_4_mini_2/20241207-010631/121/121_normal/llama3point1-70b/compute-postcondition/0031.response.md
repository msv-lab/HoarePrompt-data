The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on conditions evaluated within it:

- In Case 1, the function returns the integer 7.
- In Case 2, the function returns the value of `num`, which is 7.
- In Case 3, the function returns the value of `num`, which is 8.
- In Case 4, the function returns the value of `num`, which is 9.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return specific integer values (7, 8, or 9) based on the conditions evaluated within the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer greater than 0, and returns either 7, 8, or 9 based on certain conditions evaluated within the function.**
