The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 2, so after the increment, `count` becomes 3. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 8, if `func_1(num)` returns true, then `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 8, if `func_1(num)` returns true, then `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
