`num` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 7 to 8. The variable `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, and `count` is 2, which remains unchanged. The condition regarding `func_1(num)` still holds as it has not been affected by the code execution. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 8, if `func_1(num)` returns true, then `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
