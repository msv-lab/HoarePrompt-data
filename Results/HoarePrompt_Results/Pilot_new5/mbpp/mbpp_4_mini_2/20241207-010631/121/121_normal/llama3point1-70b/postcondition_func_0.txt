The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. It returns False if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it checks for factors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any factors are found, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not handle negative integers or other types, but since it's designed to accept only non-negative integers, this limitation is assumed to be outside its scope.
