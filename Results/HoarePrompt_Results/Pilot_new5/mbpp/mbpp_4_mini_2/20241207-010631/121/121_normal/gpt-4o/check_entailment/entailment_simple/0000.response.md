The program is supposed to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, upon analyzing the code, we can see that the function `func_1` does not compute the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes correctly.

The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are a specific sequence of primes whose indices are determined by a particular recurrence relation, and they are not given just as the return of the iterative process in the provided code. 

The logic in the function generates a sequence based on the relation \( S_{n} = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \), which is an arithmetic sequence and does not correlate with the definition of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. The expected output according to the assertions does not align with the actual prime sequence being generated.

For instance:
- `func_1(3)` returns `7` (which is correct for the 3rd prime), but this is due to coincidental output rather than an accurate representation of the 3rd Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.
- The 4th and 5th assertions also don't hold up under scrutiny as there is no proper mapping between the output from the function and the expected prime numbers.

Thus, the function does not correctly implement the logic necessary to derive the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

Correctness: **False**
