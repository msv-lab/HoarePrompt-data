According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. 

At this point, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 3**
