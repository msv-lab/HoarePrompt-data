Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is 9. If `num % 6` is either 1 or 5 and `count` equals `n`, the function returns the value of `num`, which is 9. If `count` does not equal `n`, there is no return value from the function.***
