The values of `S0` and `S1` are updated according to the tuple assignment. Given the initial state, after executing the code:

- `S0` will take the value of `S1`, which is 3.
- `S1` will take the value of `S_next`, which is 7.

The values of `n`, `i`, and `S_next` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**.
