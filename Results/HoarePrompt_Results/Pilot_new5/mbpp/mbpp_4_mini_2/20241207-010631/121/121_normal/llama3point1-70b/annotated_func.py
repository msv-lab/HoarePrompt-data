    #The program returns True, indicating that n is a prime number, as it passed the conditions where i is at least 2 and less than or equal to the integer square root of n, completing the loop without returning False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. It returns False if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it checks for factors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any factors are found, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not handle negative integers or other types, but since it's designed to accept only non-negative integers, this limitation is assumed to be outside its scope.

        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `num` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies `func_1(num)` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, `count` is equal to `n`, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 0 and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it specifically returns 7. For other values of `n`, it calculates subsequent prime numbers starting from 7, checking the conditions defined in `func_1`, and returns the nth prime number that is congruent to either 1 or 5 modulo 6. This function does not directly return 8 or 9, as implied in the annotations, but rather potentially any prime number satisfying the given conditions.
