You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, as n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0 and the current value of n is less than 2
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to the integer square root of `n`. If the loop completes without returning False, `n` is a prime number.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that n is a prime number, as it passed the conditions where i is at least 2 and less than or equal to the integer square root of n, completing the loop without returning False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. It returns False if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it checks for factors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any factors are found, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not handle negative integers or other types, but since it's designed to accept only non-negative integers, this limitation is assumed to be outside its scope.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns the integer 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1.
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `num` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies `func_1(num)` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, `count` is equal to `n`, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 0 and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it specifically returns 7. For other values of `n`, it calculates subsequent prime numbers starting from 7, checking the conditions defined in `func_1`, and returns the nth prime number that is congruent to either 1 or 5 modulo 6. This function does not directly return 8 or 9, as implied in the annotations, but rather potentially any prime number satisfying the given conditions.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
