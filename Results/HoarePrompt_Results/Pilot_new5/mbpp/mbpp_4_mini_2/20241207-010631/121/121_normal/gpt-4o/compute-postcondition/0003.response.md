The values of `S0` and `S1` are assigned to 1. The variables `n` remains unchanged as the code only affects `S0` and `S1`. The output state remains valid regarding `n` being a non-negative integer greater than 1, while both `S0` and `S1` are now equal to 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1; `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1**.
