To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop structure and the relationships among the variables. 

The loop initializes with `S0` and `S1` both set to 1, and it iteratively computes the next value `S_next` based on the previous two values. The pattern emerges that `S_next` is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0`, and then `S0` and `S1` are updated.

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute for `n - 1` times, starting from `i = 2` and ending at `i = n`.
2. **State Update**: After the loop has completed:
   - The final value of `i` will be `n + 1` (since the loop runs up to `n`).
   - The variable `S0` will hold the value of `S1` from the last iteration.
   - The variable `S1` will hold the value of `S_next` from the last iteration.

### After all iterations:
- **For n = 2**: After the first iteration, we have `S0 = 1`, `S1 = 3`.
- **For n = 3**: After the second iteration, we have `S0 = 3`, `S1 = 7`.
- **For n = 4**: After the third iteration, we have `S0 = 7`, `S1 = 17`.

Following the pattern, after `n` iterations, `S1` contains the value computed from the last iteration. The relationships show that `S0` will always be the value of `S1` from the previous computation, and `S1` will reflect the result of the last computation in the loop.

### General Pattern:
- After completing all iterations of the loop for any `n >= 2`, we can deduce that:
  - `S0` will store the value of `S1` from the last iteration.
  - `S1` will store the value of `S_next` from the last iteration.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop finish and accounting for the minimum requirement that `n` is at least 2:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is the value of `S1` from the last iteration, `S1` is the value of `S_next` from the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.**
