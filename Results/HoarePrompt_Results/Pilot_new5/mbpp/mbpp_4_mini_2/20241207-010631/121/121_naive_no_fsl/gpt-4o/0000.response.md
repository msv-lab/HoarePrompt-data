Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1(n)` aims to generate the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, the code does not actually compute the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes; instead, it calculates a sequence that appears to follow a different pattern. 

The first few Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are:
- 2 (1st)
- 3 (2nd)
- 5 (3rd)
- 7 (4th)
- 11 (5th)
- 13 (6th)
- 17 (7th)
- 19 (8th)
- 23 (9th)
- 29 (10th)
- 31 (11th)
- 41 (12th)

From the assertions in the program:
- `func_1(3)` returns 7, which is actually the 4th prime in the sequence (not 3rd).
- `func_1(4)` returns 17, which is the 7th prime (not 4th).
- `func_1(5)` returns 41, which is the 12th prime (not 5th).

None of the provided assertions match the actual nth Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, demonstrating that the function does not adhere to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
