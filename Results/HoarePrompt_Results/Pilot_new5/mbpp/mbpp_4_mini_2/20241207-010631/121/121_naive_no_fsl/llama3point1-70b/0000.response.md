Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logic flaw related to the definition of the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. Specifically, the first few Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are defined as follows: 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and so on. 

The function `func_2` is supposed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]:` is used to filter potential prime candidates. Although it is true that all Newman-Shanks-Williams primes greater than 7 are of the form 6k ± 1, the function misses some prime numbers that are not of this form but are still Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

For example:

- The second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is 11. The program will not return this correctly because it will skip over 11 when considering numbers.
  
Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
