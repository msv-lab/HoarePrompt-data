Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list of real numbers as input.
2. **Rounding**: It rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer using the `round()` function.
3. **Summation**: It calculates the sum of these rounded integers using the `sum()` function.
4. **Multiplication**: It multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list, which is the correct approach as per the problem description.
5. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed result.

The annotated assertions provide examples that demonstrate the expected behavior of the function, confirming that the implementation meets the requirements. Additionally, the explanation in the comments correctly explains that if the input list is empty, the function will return 0, which aligns with the expectations since the product of any number with 0 is 0.

Overall, the function follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases, including those with positive, negative, and zero values in the list.
