Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a list of real numbers as input, which aligns with the problem description stating that it needs to process a list of numbers.

2. **Rounding**: The program rounds each number in the list using the `round()` function inside a list comprehension. This step ensures that every number is rounded, as specified in the problem.

3. **Summation**: After rounding the numbers, the function calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers using the `sum()` function, which is consistent with the requirement to sum the rounded values.

4. **Multiplying by Length**: Finally, the program multiplies the total sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the original list (`len(numbers)`), as stated in the problem description.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns this final result, which is exactly what the problem asks for: the sum of the rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list.

The assertions at the beginning serve as test cases verifying that the function produces the expected output for various inputs, further confirming that the implementation is correct. The program will handle any list of real numbers correctly, fulfilling all requirements of the problem statement.
