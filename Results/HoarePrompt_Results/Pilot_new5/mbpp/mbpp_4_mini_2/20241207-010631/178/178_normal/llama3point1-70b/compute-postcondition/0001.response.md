The value of `total_sum` is assigned the sum of the values in the `rounded_numbers` list. The `numbers` list remains unchanged, and the `rounded_numbers` list is still a list of rounded values corresponding to the original `numbers`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of the corresponding numbers in `numbers`, and `total_sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of the corresponding numbers in `numbers`, `total_sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `rounded_numbers`.**
