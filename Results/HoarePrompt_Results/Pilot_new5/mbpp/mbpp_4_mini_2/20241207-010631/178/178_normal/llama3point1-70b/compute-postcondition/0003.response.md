The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numbers, which can be either integers or floats. The function calculates the sum of all elements in `numbers`, referred to as `total_sum`, and then returns the product of `total_sum` and the length of `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numbers and return the product of the sum of those numbers and the count of numbers in the list.
