Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly fulfills the problem description. It rounds each number in the list and calculates the total sum of those rounded numbers, which is then multiplied by the length of the original list. 

To verify its correctness:
- The rounding is correctly applied through the use of Python's built-in `round()` function.
- The sum of the rounded numbers is computed using the `sum()` function.
- Finally, the total sum is multiplied by `len(numbers)` to account for the length of the input list.

This logic correctly adheres to the problem requirements, and there are no edge cases identified that would cause it to malfunction. Thus, the program behaves as expected across various inputs.
