Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a recursive function to flatten a given nested list structure. It handles the following cases:

1. It can process lists of varying depths, as evidenced by the recursive call to `func_1(i)` when an element is itself a list.
2. It correctly appends non-list elements to the `flat_list`, ensuring that only the values from the nested structure are included in the final flat list.
3. It does not lose any elements regardless of how deeply nested they are, as each level of nesting is accounted for.

Since I cannot find any potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, it is correct.
