Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function `func_1` that flattens a nested list structure. It recursively checks each item in the input list, and if the item is itself a list, it calls `func_1` on that item to flatten it further. If the item is not a list, it directly appends it to the `flat_list`.

The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases, and they all evaluate to the expected flattened lists. 

Additionally, I examined potential edge cases:
1. An empty list (`[]`) should return an empty list (`[]`).
2. A deeply nested list structure should still be flattened correctly (e.g., `[[[1, 2], [3]], 4]` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`).

Since all of these cases are handled correctly by the function, and there are no potential cases that disrupt the expected functionality, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
