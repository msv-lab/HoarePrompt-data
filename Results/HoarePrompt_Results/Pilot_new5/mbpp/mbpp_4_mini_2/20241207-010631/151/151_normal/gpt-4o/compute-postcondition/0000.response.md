The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The original state of `nested_list` remains unchanged, as the code only affects the initialization of `flat_list`. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `flat_list` is now an empty list while `nested_list` remains as a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, and may be nested to any depth.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, and may be nested to any depth; `flat_list` is an empty list.**
