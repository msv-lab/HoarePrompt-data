According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains more than 1 item, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 1 item, and `item` is the first item in that list. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must contain at least 2 items, and `item` will be updated to the second item in the list.

State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 items, item is the second item in the list, flat_list contains the elements returned by func_1(item) if item is a list, or flat_list contains the item from nested_list if item is not a list.**
