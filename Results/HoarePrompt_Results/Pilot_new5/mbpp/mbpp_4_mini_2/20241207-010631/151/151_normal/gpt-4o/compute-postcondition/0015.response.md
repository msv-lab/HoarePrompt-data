To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the final condition and relationships of the variables involved.

The loop iterates over `nested_list`, which can contain integers, lists, or a mixture of both. Each item in `nested_list` is processed individually:

1. If the item is a list, it calls `func_1(item)` and extends `flat_list` with the result.
2. If the item is not a list, it appends the item directly to `flat_list`.

After processing all items in `nested_list`, `flat_list` will contain all integers from `nested_list` as well as the flattened contents of any inner lists. 

For it to be the case that all iterations have executed, `nested_list` must contain at least some items (i.e., it cannot be empty). If `nested_list` is empty, then `flat_list` remains empty.

Output State: **`flat_list` contains all integers and the flattened elements of any lists contained within `nested_list`, `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, lists, or a combination of both.**
