According to the code, the loop will execute again for the next element in `nested_list`. Currently, `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the third element in the `nested_list`. Thus, `nested_list` must have at least 3 elements for the next iteration to take place.

State: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list**
