The variable `item` is appended to `flat_list`. Since `item` is the third item in `nested_list`, it is directly taken from that list. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` contains at least 3 items, meaning `item` has a defined value from that list. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `item`.**
