The value of `i`, which is the third element in the `nested_list`, gets appended to `flat_list`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and `flat_list` will now contain `i` as an additional element. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` includes the value of `i`.**
