According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` must have at least 1 element, so it is currently possible that `i` is the first element of the list. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- The `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements.
- The next value of `i` should be the second element in the list.

State: **`nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list, `flat_list` is extended accordingly based on the type of `i`.**
