The code appends the value of `i` to the `flat_list`. The initial state confirms that `nested_list` has at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `nested_list`. Therefore, the value of `i` is defined and can be any type but is not a list.

The output state will reflect that `flat_list` now contains `i` as its new element, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, `i` is not a list, and `flat_list` now contains `i`.**
