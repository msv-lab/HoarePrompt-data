According to the code, the loop will execute if `nested_list` contains at least one element. The variable `i` will represent the first element of `nested_list` during the initial iteration. Since `flat_list` is empty and does not affect the execution of the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `nested_list` must contain at least one element, and `i` should be set to the first element in `nested_list`. 

State: **`nested_list` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`**
