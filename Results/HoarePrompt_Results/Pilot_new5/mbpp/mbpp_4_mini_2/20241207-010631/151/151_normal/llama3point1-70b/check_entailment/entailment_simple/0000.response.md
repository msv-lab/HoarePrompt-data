Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to flatten a nested list structure. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Recursive Traversal**: The program uses a recursive approach to traverse through the input `nested_list`. For each element in the list, it checks if the element is also a list.

2. **Flattening Logic**: If the element is a list, the function calls itself (`func_1(i)`) to flatten that sublist, effectively handling any levels of nesting. The results are then extended into `flat_list`.

3. **Handling Non-List Elements**: If the element is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`. This ensures that all elements, whether they are nested or not, are included in the final flattened list.

4. **Empty List Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where `nested_list` is empty. In this case, `flat_list` remains empty as there are no elements to process.

The function ultimately returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements from the original nested list structure in a single, flat list, thus fulfilling the requirement to flatten the nested list.

Since the program can handle any combination of lists and non-lists, as well as varying depths of nesting, it adheres perfectly to the problem description.
