#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, and may be nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` contains all integers and the flattened elements of any lists contained within `nested_list`, `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, lists, or a combination of both.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list which contains all integers and the flattened elements of any lists contained within nested_list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a nested list, which can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, and returns a flat list containing all integers and the elements from any nested lists, preserving the order of the integers. The function correctly handles arbitrary levels of nesting and ensures that all elements are included in the output list.
