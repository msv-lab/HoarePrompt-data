The function accepts a list `nested_list` that may contain integers, nested lists, or other non-list elements. It recursively flattens this list, returning a single list that contains all integers and non-list elements from `nested_list`, preserving their order. If `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function does not handle cases where non-list elements are nested within lists; it assumes any non-list element can be added directly to the flattened list.
