Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly implements a function to flatten a nested list structure. It recursively checks each element of the input list, and if the element is a list itself, it calls the same function to flatten that sublist, extending the `flat_list` with the flattened contents. If the element is not a list, it simply appends the element to `flat_list`.

The function should work for various scenarios:
1. It handles empty lists correctly by returning an empty list.
2. It correctly flattens lists of varying depths and structures, including lists containing other lists.
3. It can handle cases where non-list elements are present, such as integers, strings, and other data types.

Since I cannot find any input case where the function would not work as described, the program is considered correct.
