According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `i`. Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute for `j` values of 0 and 1. After the last iteration (when `j` was 0), it will proceed to the next iteration with `j` updated to 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still 2 but `j` is now 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be incremented to 2. The loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`, which is the case here since `j` is 1 and `i` is 2.

State: **`dp` is a list with valid entries, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `nums` has at least 3 elements**
