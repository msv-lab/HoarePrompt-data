The code snippet updates the `dp` list at the index `i`, assigning it the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The value of `dp[i]` will depend on the value of `dp[j]`, which is affected by the previous state of `j`. The initial conditions state that `i` must be greater than `j + 1`, which implies `i` is at least `j + 2`.

As `j` is incremented to `j + 1`, its previous value is updated, but the exact numerical value is not known. The impact of the code is that `dp[i]` is modified based on the value of `dp[j]`, and since `j` has changed, it influences the new value assigned to `dp[i]`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[i]` without specifying the exact numerical values, since the exact values of `dp` and the previous values of `j` and `i` were not provided.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `j` is incremented to `j + 1`, `i` is greater than `j + 1`, `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)**
