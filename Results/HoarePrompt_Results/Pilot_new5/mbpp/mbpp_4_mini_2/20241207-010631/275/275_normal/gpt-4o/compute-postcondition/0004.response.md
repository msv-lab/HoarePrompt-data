The code initializes the list `dp` with a length equal to that of `nums`, where each element is set to 1. The variable `nums` is a sorted list of integers, which remains unchanged. The variable `dp` now holds a list filled with 1s, with the same length as `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1 and the length is equal to that of `nums`.**
