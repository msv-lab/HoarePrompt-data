Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `dp[i-1]` is at least 1. `dp` will be updated such that `dp[k]` will contain the length of the longest divisible subsequence ending with `nums[k]` for all indices `k` from 0 to `i-1`.**
