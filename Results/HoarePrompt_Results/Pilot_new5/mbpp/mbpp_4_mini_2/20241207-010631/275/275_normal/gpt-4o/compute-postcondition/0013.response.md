According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the current value of `i`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is set to 0, and `i` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for each iteration, so the next value of `j` would be 1. Additionally, for the loop to run again, `j` must be less than `i`, which in this case means `i` must be greater than 1 (which it is, since `i` is at least 2).

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is at least 1, `i` is at least 2, and `j` is 1**.
