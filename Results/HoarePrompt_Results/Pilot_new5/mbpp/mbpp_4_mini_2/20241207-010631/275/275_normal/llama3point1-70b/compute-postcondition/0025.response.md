According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `i`. The loop will iterate while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `i` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 3, and `i` must remain at least 3.

State: **`dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by previous elements and `i` is at least 3, and `j` is 3.**
