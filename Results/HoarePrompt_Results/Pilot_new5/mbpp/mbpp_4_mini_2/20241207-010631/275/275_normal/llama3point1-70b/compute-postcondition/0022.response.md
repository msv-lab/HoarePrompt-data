According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. Specifically, the loop iterates for `j` from `0` to `i-1`. If `i` is greater than `1`, the loop can execute at least once more, as `j` will take the values `0` and `1`.

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that we are about to start a new iteration, and `j` must be incremented by `1` for the next loop iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `2`, at which point `j` will be `2`.

State: **`dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by previous elements, `i` must be at least 2, `j` is 2**
