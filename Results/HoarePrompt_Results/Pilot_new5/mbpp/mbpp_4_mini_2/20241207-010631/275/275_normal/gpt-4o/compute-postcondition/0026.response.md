The code assigns a new value to `dp[i]`, which is the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `i` is greater than 2 and `j` is 2, we are ensuring that we are accessing valid indices within the `dp` list. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
