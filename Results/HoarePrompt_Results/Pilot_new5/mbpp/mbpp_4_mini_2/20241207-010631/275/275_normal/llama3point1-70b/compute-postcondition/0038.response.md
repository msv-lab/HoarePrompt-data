The code snippet updates the list `dp` at index `i` (which is 2) based on the maximum value between its current value and the value at index `j` (which is also 2) plus 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `dp` is a list with valid entries,
- `i` is 2,
- `j` is 2,
- `nums` has at least 3 elements.

The operation `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` will result in updating `dp[2]` based on its current value and the value of `dp[2] + 1`. 

If we denote the value of `dp[2]` as `dp[2]` before the operation, then after executing the code:
- `dp[2]` will become `max(dp[2], dp[2] + 1)`, which will always evaluate to `dp[2] + 1` since `dp[2] + 1` is greater than or equal to `dp[2]`.

Thus, the variable `dp[2]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`dp` is a list with valid entries, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[2]` is increased by 1.**
