Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` + 1, and `dp[i-1]` is at least 1, `j` will start at 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.***
