Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if the list is empty. If the list is not empty, it returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequence from the sorted list of integers. This is accomplished by building a dynamic programming list `dp` that tracks the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each element based on its divisibility with preceding elements. **
