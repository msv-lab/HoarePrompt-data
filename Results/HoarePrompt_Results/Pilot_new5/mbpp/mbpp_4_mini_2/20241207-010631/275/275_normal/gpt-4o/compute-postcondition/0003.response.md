The `sort()` method is called on the list `nums`, which modifies `nums` in place by rearranging its elements in ascending order. Since `nums` is not empty, it will contain integers that will be sorted. The previous values of `nums` are not specified in the initial state, but we know that it is a list of integers.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers**
