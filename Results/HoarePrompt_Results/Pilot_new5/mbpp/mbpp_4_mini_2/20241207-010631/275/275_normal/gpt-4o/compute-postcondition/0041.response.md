Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of integers where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subsequence ending at that index, `dp` will contain the lengths for all indices based on the relationships defined by divisibility among the elements of `nums`. If `nums` is empty, then `dp` will also be an empty list.**
