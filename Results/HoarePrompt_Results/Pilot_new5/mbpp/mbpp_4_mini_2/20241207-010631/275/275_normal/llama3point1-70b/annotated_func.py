#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the current value of 'nums' is an empty list.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by any of the previous elements, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and the values of `dp` may vary depending on the divisibility relationships among elements of `nums`. If the loop does not execute, `dp` remains a list of `1`s.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which represents the length of the longest subsequence of 'nums' where each element is divisible by any of the previous elements. If the loop does not execute, 'dp' remains a list of 1's.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if `nums` is empty. If `nums` is not empty, it returns the length of the longest subsequence where each element is divisible by any of the previous elements in the sorted list. If no such subsequence exists, the function returns 1, as each individual element is a subsequence of length 1.
