According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to the length of `nums`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, which means the loop has completed all its iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be increased by 1, but since `i` is already equal to `len(nums)`, it cannot execute one more time. 

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to indicate that the loop has completed. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subsequence ending at that index, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, `dp[i-1]` is at least 1 (if `i > 0`)**.
