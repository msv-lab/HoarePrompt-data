The code initializes the variable `dp` as a list where each element is set to `1`, and the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`. Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the length of `dp` will be equal to the number of elements in `nums`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers with length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is `1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers with length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is `1`.**
