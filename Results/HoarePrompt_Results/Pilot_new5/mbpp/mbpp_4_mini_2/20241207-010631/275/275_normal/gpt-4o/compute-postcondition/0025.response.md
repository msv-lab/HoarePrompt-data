According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and its relation to `i`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. 

Since `i` is greater than 0, we can assume that `i` is at least 2 for the loop to potentially execute again. Hence, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be 2, and `i` must remain greater than 2.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
