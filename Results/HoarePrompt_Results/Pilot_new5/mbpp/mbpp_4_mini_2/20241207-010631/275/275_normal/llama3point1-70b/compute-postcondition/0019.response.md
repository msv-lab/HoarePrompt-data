Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by previous elements, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 elements. The current index `i` is 2 and `j` can take values 0 and 1. The current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.***
