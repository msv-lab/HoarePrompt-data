According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Given that `i` is at least 2 at the end of the last iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, and `dp` is a list corresponding to `nums`, `dp[i]` will be updated based on the division condition involving `nums[j]`.

Now, we need to ensure that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 3, and we also need to keep in mind that the state of `dp[i]` may change depending on the relationships between the elements in `nums`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers representing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`, `i` is 3**
