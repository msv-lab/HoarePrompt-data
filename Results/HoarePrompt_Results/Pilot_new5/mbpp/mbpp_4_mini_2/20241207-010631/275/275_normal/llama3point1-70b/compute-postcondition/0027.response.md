Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by previous elements. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[3]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[3] + 1` for `i >= 3.***
