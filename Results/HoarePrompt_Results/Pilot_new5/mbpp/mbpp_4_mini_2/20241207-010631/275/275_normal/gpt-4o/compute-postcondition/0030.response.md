According to the code, the loop iterates from `0` to `i - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than `0`. Given that `i` is currently set to the length of `nums` + 1, it is guaranteed to be greater than `1` as long as `nums` has at least one element. Therefore, the loop will execute with `j` starting from `0`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be `i - 1`. Since `dp[i-1]` is also given to be at least `1`, the states can remain unchanged.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` + 1, and `dp[i-1]` is at least 1, `j` will start at 0**
