Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers representing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`, and `i` is at least 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
