Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. The task is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, which implies that the function should eliminate any lowercase letters from the input string `s`. 

However, the provided program only retains uppercase letters and ignores lowercase letters entirely. This means that it does not remove lowercase substrings as required; instead, it constructs a new string that only includes uppercase letters. 

For example, given the input string "HelloWorld", the expected output according to the problem description would be "HW" (removing lowercase letters), but the program would output "HW", which is partially correct but does not align with the explicit instruction to remove lowercase substrings.

Thus, the function does not operate according to the problem requirements, making it incorrect.
