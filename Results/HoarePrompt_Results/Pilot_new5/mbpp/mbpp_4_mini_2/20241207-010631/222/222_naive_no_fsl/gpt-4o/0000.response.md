Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of removing lowercase substrings from the input string. It does so by returning a new string that consists only of the uppercase characters from the original string. 

The test cases provided:
- `func_1('PYTHon')` returns `'PYTH'`, which is correct.
- `func_1('FInD')` returns `'FID'`, which is also correct.
- `func_1('STRinG')` returns `'STRG'`, which is correct as well.

I cannot think of any potential cases where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description. It effectively handles different input scenarios, including strings with mixed case characters. Thus, the function performs correctly for the given task.
