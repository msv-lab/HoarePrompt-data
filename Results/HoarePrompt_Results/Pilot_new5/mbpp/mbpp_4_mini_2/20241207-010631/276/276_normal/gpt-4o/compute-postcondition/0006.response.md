Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the lists (n > 0), and `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is calculated as (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2. Otherwise, the median is equal to `merged_list[n]`.***
