The value of `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[mid]`. Since `mid` is equal to `n`, and considering that the length of `merged_list` is odd, this means that `median` will be the middle element of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the lists (n > 0), `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, `mid` is `n`, and `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.**
