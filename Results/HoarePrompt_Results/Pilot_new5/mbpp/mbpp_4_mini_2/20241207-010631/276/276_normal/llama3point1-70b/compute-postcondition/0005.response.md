The variable `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[middle_index]`. Since `size` is an odd integer, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`, which refers to the last index of `merged_list` divided by 2. Therefore, `median` will hold the value located at this index in `merged_list`. The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `size` is a positive odd integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all integers from `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `median` is the value at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.**
