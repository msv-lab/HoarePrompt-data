Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the median of two sorted lists of the same size. While the program attempts to merge the two lists and then calculate the median based on the merged list, there is a critical issue with the logic used to determine the median value.

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation for Odd Length**: The problem description states that the function should handle two lists of the same size, and therefore the merged list will always have an even number of elements (2n, where n is the size of each list). The program correctly handles the case when the merged list is of even length by averaging the two middle values. However, it incorrectly states that it would return `merged_list[n]` for the median when the merged list is odd. Since the merged list will never be odd (given n > 0 and both lists are of the same size), this logic is irrelevant but indicates a misunderstanding in the implementation.

2. **Unclear Return Value Logic**: The comment within the code mentions that if the length of `merged_list` is odd, it returns `merged_list[n]`. However, with the assumptions given (that both lists are of the same size), this condition will never be true. It suggests a faulty understanding of the input sizes and could lead to confusion or incorrect assumptions about functionality.

Therefore, the code does not reliably meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, specifically regarding the calculation of the median for two sorted lists of the same size. 

Thus, the conclusion is that the implementation does not meet the problem requirements, leading to the determination of correctness as **False**.
