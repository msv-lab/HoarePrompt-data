The `merged_list` variable is assigned the value of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. Since `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, the new `merged_list` will contain all elements from both lists in sorted order. The previous states of `list1`, `list2`, and `n` remain valid, but `merged_list` is newly defined.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the lists (n > 0), `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`.**
