The variable `middle_index` is assigned the value of `size - 1`. The `size` variable is stated to be a positive integer, so `middle_index` will also be a non-negative integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `size` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all integers from `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`.**
