To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the program step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
The function must find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Function Definition**:
   ```python
   def func_1(list1, list2, n):
   ```
   This function takes two lists and a positive integer representing their size.

2. **Merging and Sorting**:
   ```python
   merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
   ```
   The function combines the two lists and sorts them. This is appropriate since the median requires the entire sorted list.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   ```python
   mid = len(merged_list) // 2
   if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
       median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
   else :
       median = merged_list[mid]
   ```
   The function correctly checks if the total number of elements in `merged_list` is even or odd and calculates the median accordingly:
   - If even, it averages the two middle elements.
   - If odd, it takes the middle element directly.

4. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return median
   ```
   The function returns the computed median, which is expected.

### Assertions:
The provided assertions are tests that confirm the function behaves as intended for specific input cases. They support the correctness of the function.

### Potential Issues:
The key aspect to verify is that the function handles lists of the same size correctly, as expected. The function does not impose any restrictions on the contents of the lists, other than that they must be sorted and of the same size.

### Conclusion:
- The function correctly merges two sorted lists, calculates the median based on whether the total number of elements is odd or even, and returns the proper median value.
- All assertions pass, indicating the function performs as expected.

Thus, we conclude that the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
