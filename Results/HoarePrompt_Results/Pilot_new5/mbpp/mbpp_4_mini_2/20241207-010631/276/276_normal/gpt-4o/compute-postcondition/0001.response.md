The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the length of `merged_list` by 2. Since `merged_list` is a sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and both lists have the same size `n`, the length of `merged_list` will be `2 * n`. Therefore, `len(merged_list)` will equal `2 * n`, and `mid` will be `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the lists (n > 0), `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, `mid` is `n`.**
