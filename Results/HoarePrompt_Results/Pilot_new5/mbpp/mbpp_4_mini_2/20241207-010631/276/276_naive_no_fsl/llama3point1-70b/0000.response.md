Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logic error in how it calculates the median. Specifically, the calculation of the `middle_index` is incorrect for finding the median in a list of size `size`. The `middle_index` should be calculated as `size // 2` to find the central index in a merged list of `size * 2` (since it merges two lists of the same size). 

When `size` is odd, the logic fails to handle it correctly since it assumes `size` is always even due to the incorrect calculation of `middle_index`. For example:

- If `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, then `size = 2`. The merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the median by trying to access out-of-bounds indices.

Therefore, the implementation does not cover all cases required by the problem description, leading to incorrect results.
