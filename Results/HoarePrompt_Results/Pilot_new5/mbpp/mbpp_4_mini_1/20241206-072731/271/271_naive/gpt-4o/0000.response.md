Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input tuples have varying lengths. If the function is given tuples of different lengths, it will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access indices that do not exist in one or more of the tuples. For example, calling `func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))` would result in an error because the second tuple has more elements than the first.
