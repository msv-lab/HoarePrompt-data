To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, I will analyze the function `func_1` and its behavior with varying inputs.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples and computes the average for each position across all the inner tuples.
2. **Logic of Implementation**:
   - It initializes `num_elements` to the length of the first inner tuple.
   - It then iterates over each index (from `0` to `num_elements - 1`).
   - For each index, it collects the elements from all inner tuples at that index into a list (`elements_at_position`).
   - It calculates the average for those collected elements and appends it to the `averages` list.
3. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the `averages` list.

### Checking for Edge Cases

- **General Structure**: The function assumes that all inner tuples have the same length. If they don't, accessing an index that doesn't exist in shorter tuples would raise an `IndexError`. 
- **Example of a Failing Case**:
  - If we have inputs like `((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`, the first tuple has 2 elements while the second has 3. This will lead to an `IndexError` when `i` is `2`.
  
- **Empty Tuples**: If we provide an empty tuple, such as `()`, the program will fail by raising an `IndexError` when attempting to access the first element with `tuples[0]`.

- **Single Tuple Edge Case**: If there is only one tuple, e.g., `((1, 2, 3),)`, the function should handle this correctly and return `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`.

- **Negative Numbers**: The function correctly computes averages with negative numbers and should work as expected.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not handle cases where the inner tuples do not have consistent lengths or where there are empty tuples. Thus, it fails for these edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
