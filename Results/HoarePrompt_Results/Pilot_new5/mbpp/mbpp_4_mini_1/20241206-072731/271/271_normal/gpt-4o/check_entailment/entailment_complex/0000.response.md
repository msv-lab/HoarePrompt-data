Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it does not handle the case where the inner tuples might have varying lengths. The problem description states that the function must take a tuple of tuples and return a list of averages based on the corresponding values at each position across all tuples. However, if the inner tuples are not of the same length, the list comprehension `[t[i] for t in tuples]` will raise an `IndexError` when `i` exceeds the length of one of the inner tuples.

For example, if we call `func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))`, this would lead to an `IndexError` because the first tuple has a length of 2, but the second tuple has a length of 3. This violates the requirement that the function should handle tuples of equal length and return averages accordingly.

Thus, the function is not robust against input where the inner tuples have varying lengths, which means it does not fully conform to the problem description's requirements.
