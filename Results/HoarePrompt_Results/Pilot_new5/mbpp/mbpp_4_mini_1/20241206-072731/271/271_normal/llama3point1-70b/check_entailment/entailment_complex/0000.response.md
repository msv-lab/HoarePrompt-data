Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully comply with the problem description due to a critical oversight: it does not handle the case where the input might be an empty tuple or tuples of varying lengths. 

1. **Empty Input Case**: If an empty tuple is passed (i.e., `()`), the program will attempt to compute the average, leading to a division by zero error since `len(tuples)` would be zero.

2. **Varying Lengths**: If the inner tuples have different lengths, the `zip(*tuples)` function will truncate the input to the length of the shortest inner tuple, potentially leading to incorrect results because it does not calculate averages for all corresponding positions across the tuples.

These issues mean that the function could fail or produce unexpected results when given a wider range of inputs than assumed in the annotations. Hence, the program is not correct according to the problem requirements.
