The variable `elements_at_position` is updated to be a list comprehension that extracts the `i`-th element from each tuple in `tuples`. The initial value of `i` is 1. Since `num_elements` is greater than 1, there are at least two elements in each tuple, which makes `t[i]` valid for every tuple in `tuples`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is now a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, `averages` now includes `avg`.**
