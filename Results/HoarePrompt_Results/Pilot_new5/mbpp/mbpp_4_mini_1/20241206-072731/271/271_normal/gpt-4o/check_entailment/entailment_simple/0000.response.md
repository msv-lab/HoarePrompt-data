The program has correctly implemented the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of its correctness:

1. **Input Type**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Computing Averages**: 
   - The function retrieves the number of elements in the first tuple using `num_elements = len(tuples[0])`. This is appropriate, as it assumes all inner tuples have the same length.
   - It initializes an empty list `averages` to store the computed averages.
   - It iterates over the range of `num_elements`, and for each index `i`, it collects all the elements at that index from each tuple using a list comprehension: `elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`.
   - It calculates the average of these collected elements using `avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)` and appends this average to the `averages` list.

3. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the list of averages, which matches the expected output described in the problem.

4. **Edge Handling**: The program handles the situation where `num_elements` is zero by ensuring that if there are no elements to average, it will return an empty list.

Based on this analysis, the program fulfills all the requirements set forth in the problem description. It computes the average for each corresponding position across all tuples correctly.

Correctness: **True**
