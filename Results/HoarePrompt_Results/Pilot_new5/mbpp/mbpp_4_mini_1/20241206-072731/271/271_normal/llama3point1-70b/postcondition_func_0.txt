The function accepts a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length. It returns a list of averages, with each average calculated as the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the number of inner tuples. There are no checks for empty tuples or tuples with uneven lengths, which could lead to errors or unexpected results if the input does not meet these assumptions.
