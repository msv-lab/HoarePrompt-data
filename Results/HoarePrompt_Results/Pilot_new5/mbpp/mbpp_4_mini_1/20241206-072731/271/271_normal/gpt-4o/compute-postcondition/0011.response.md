The variable `elements_at_position` is assigned the list comprehension that extracts the second element (index `i`, which is 2) from each tuple in `tuples`. Given that `num_elements` must be greater than 2, `elements_at_position` will be populated with the second elements of each tuple. The previous state of `elements_at_position` is overwritten by this new list.

The states of the other variables are not affected directly, so the output state will reflect the new value for `elements_at_position`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, `num_elements` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is now a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` includes the updated `avg` value.**
