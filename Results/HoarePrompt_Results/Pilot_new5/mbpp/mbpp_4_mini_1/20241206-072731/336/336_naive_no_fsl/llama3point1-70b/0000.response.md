To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's first understand the requirements:

### Problem Description:
We need to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers.

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program iterates through each index `i` of the list `lst`.
2. For each index, it checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
3. If the index is odd, it then checks if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
4. If both conditions are true, it returns `False`.
5. If it completes the loop without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

### Checking for Potential Cases:
- If the input list is empty (`[]`), the program will return `True` because there are no indices to check.
- If the input list contains only even numbers at odd indices, the program should return `False`.
- For a list like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the odd indices are 1 (value 2) and 3 (value 4). The program would correctly return `False`.
- For a list like `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, there are no odd indices with even numbers, so it would return `True`.
- For a single-element list `[1]`, there are no odd indices, so it would return `True`.

### Edge Cases:
- Consider a case with negative numbers: `[-1, 2, -3, 4]`. The program would return `False` since index 1 has an even number.
- Consider a list with mixed values: `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6]`. The program would return `False` since index 1 is even.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering various cases, we find that the program correctly identifies whether every odd index contains an odd number. No counterexamples were found that violate the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
