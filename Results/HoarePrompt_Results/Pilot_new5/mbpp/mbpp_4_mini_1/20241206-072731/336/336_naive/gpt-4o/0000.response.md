Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers. However, it fails to check the case where the list is empty. For an empty list `[]`, the program would return `True`, which is incorrect as there are no odd indices to satisfy the condition. The expected behavior for an empty list should be clarified, but generally, a list with no elements should not be considered valid for the requirements specified. 

Additionally, consider the input `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`. The odd indexed elements are `1`, `3`, `7`, and `3`, which are odd, so it returns `True` correctly. However, for an input like `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, which contains no odd indexed numbers, it would incorrectly return `True` as well, because it only checks for the evenness of values present at odd indices rather than assessing the necessity of those indices containing odd numbers. Hence, there is a flaw in handling the empty list case, as well as the scenario where only even numbers are present at odd indices.
