Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is intended to check whether every odd index in the input list contains odd numbers. However, the logic implemented in the function incorrectly assumes that the length of the list must be even and that encountering an even number at an odd index is the only condition for returning `False`.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Ignoring odd index verification**: The function correctly checks for odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) but it only checks if the numbers at those indices are even. It does not explicitly verify that those indices must contain odd numbers, which is the requirement stated in the problem description.

2. **Incorrect assumption about list length**: The comments in the function suggest that the length of the list is important, specifically asserting that it must be even. The problem description does not impose any requirement on the length of the list.

3. **Test cases**: The test assertions do not capture all edge cases. For example, the condition of having odd or even lengths of the list is not tested, and the third assertion would incorrectly return `False` if the function logic is followed strictly.

For example, if we call `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])`, the function checks `1` (odd index, returns True), `3` (odd index, returns False), and then moves onto `7`, which is odd on an odd index. The function would return `True` incorrectly instead of confirming that all odd indices contain odd numbers.

Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is incorrect.
