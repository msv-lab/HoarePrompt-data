According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst`. If `lst` has at least 1 integer, the loop executes again for the next index. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, which means `i` will become 1. Since `lst` must have at least 2 integers for the loop to execute again (as `i` needs to be a valid index), the condition is satisfied given that `lst` has at least 1 integer.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1. `i` is even or `lst[i]` is odd.**
