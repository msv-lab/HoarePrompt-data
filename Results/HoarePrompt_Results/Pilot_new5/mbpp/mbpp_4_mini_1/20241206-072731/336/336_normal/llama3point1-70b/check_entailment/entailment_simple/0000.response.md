The program is designed to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. Let's analyze how the program operates in relation to the problem description.

1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` of integers as input.

2. **Iteration**: The program iterates over each index `i` of the list `lst`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - For every index `i`, the program checks if `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
   - If `i` is odd, the program further checks whether the value at that index (`lst[i]`) is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
   - If both conditions are true, the function returns `False`, indicating that there is at least one odd index containing an even number.

4. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding an even number at any odd index, the function returns `True`, confirming that all odd indices contain odd values.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description:

- The problem states that we need to verify that every odd index in the list contains odd numbers. The program correctly identifies odd indices using `i % 2 != 0` and checks their corresponding values for oddness.
- The program returns `False` if it finds any odd index with an even number, which contradicts the requirement.
- If all odd indices contain odd numbers (and thus no even numbers are found at odd indices), the program returns `True`, which aligns with the requirement.

### Conclusion:

The program behaves as expected according to the problem description. It checks each odd index and ensures that they contain odd numbers. Therefore, it does fulfill the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
