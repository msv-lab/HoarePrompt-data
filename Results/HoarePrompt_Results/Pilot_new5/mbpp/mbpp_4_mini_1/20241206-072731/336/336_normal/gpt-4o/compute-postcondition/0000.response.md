According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to the length of `lst`, incrementing by 2. For the loop to execute, the length of `lst` must be at least 2 (since it needs to start from index 1). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the last valid odd index in the range, and it will start from 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 2 integers, and `i` will start at 1.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
