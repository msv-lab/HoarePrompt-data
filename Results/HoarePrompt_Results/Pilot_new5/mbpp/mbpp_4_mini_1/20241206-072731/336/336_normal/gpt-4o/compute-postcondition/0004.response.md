According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `lst` and the value of `i`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. Since at the end of the last iteration `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to 3, and `lst` needs to have at least 4 integers to ensure that `len(lst)` is greater than 3.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `i` is 3, and the element at index `i` of `lst` is an odd integer.**
