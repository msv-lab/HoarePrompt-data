According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `lst`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and increments `i` by 2 in each iteration (i.e., it iterates over the odd indices of the list). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and since `lst` has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again for `i = 5`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of the list `lst`. Since `lst` has at least 4 elements, its length is at least 4. Thus, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 5, and the loop will continue to execute if `i` is still less than the length of `lst`.

Therefore, `i` is now 5, and the length of `lst` must be at least 6 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 6 elements, `i` is 5**
