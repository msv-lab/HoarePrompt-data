You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers that must have an even length, `i` is the last odd index of `lst`, and all elements at the odd indices of `lst` are odd integers. If any element at an odd index of `lst` were even, the function would have returned False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that all elements at the odd indices of the list 'lst' are odd integers, and the list has an even length, ensuring the function would not return False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns False if any element at an odd index of the list is even. If all elements at odd indices are odd and the list has an even length, it returns True. However, if the list has an odd length, the function does not explicitly handle this case, but it will not return True because the for loop only iterates up to the last odd index, leading to a potential oversight in handling lists of odd length.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
