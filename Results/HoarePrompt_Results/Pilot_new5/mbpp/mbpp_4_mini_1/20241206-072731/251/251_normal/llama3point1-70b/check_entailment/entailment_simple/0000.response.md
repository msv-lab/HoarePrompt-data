Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi). 

Here's why the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Rectangular to Polar Conversion**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates.
   - The variable `r` is computed using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which correctly calculates the magnitude (or radius) of the point in polar coordinates as \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
   - The variable `phi` is computed using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which correctly calculates the angle (in radians) in the polar coordinate system, taking into account the signs of both `x` and `y` to determine the correct quadrant.

2. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns a tuple `(r, phi)`, which is the expected output format for polar coordinates.

3. **Correctness Across All Cases**:
   - The use of `math.hypot` and `math.atan2` ensures that the function behaves correctly for all values of `x` and `y`, including edge cases where `x` or `y` are zero, and when both are negative or positive.

Therefore, the program fulfills the requirements of converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates as outlined in the problem description.
