Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Î¸). It uses the following formulas:

1. **Radial Distance**: \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)
   - This computes the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the Cartesian plane, which is consistent with the polar coordinate definition.

2. **Angle**: \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \)
   - This computes the angle in radians relative to the positive x-axis, taking into account the signs of both x and y to determine the correct quadrant. This is also aligned with the standard definition of polar coordinates.

The assertions given in the annotated program test the function with various inputs and confirm that the expected outputs match the computed polar coordinates. Since the function handles real number inputs and correctly calculates both the radial distance and angle for any possible input values, it adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description. 

Overall, the program is validated to be correct as it fulfills all aspects of the problem description without exception.
