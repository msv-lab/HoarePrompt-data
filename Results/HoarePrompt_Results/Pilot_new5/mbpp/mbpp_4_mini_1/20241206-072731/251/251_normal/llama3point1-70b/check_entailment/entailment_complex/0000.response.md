Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates as specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two inputs, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the function should accept rectangular coordinates.

2. **Calculating Polar Coordinates**:
   - **Radius (r)**: The radius `r` is calculated using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which computes the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y). This is mathematically equivalent to \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is exactly what is required for polar coordinates.
   - **Angle (phi)**: The angle `phi` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`. This function returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). This is the correct way to obtain the angle in polar coordinates.

3. **Return Values**: The function returns both values `r` and `phi`, which are the polar coordinates corresponding to the provided rectangular coordinates.

4. **Completeness**: The comments in the code confirm that all necessary calculations are performed and that the function is complete in terms of functionality. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned, indicating that the implementation correctly handles the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, since the program meets all the criteria laid out in the problem description without any discrepancies, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
