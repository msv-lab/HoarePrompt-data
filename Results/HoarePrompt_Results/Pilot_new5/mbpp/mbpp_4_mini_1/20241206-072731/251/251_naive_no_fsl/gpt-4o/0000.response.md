Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The function `func_1` calculates the radius `r` as the Euclidean distance from the origin and the angle `θ` using `math.atan2`, which returns the angle in radians considering the correct quadrant based on the signs of `x` and `y`.

The provided assertions test the function with different sets of coordinates and all pass, demonstrating that the function behaves as expected for those inputs. Since the implementation covers both positive and negative values for `x` and `y`, as well as the case where both are zero, there are no identified edge cases or missing logic that would result in incorrect behavior. 

As such, the function is deemed correct based on the problem description and tested examples.
