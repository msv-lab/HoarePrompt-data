Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). It uses `math.hypot` to calculate the radius \( r \) as the Euclidean distance from the origin, and `math.atan2` to calculate the angle \( φ \), which accounts for the correct quadrant of the point (x, y). 

Both functions handle all possible cases, including when either x or y is zero, ensuring accurate results across the entire coordinate plane. Therefore, I cannot find any cases where the program does not work as expected, and it meets the problem description requirements.
