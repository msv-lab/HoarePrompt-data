To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and its behavior.

### Problem Description
The task is to check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only.

### Program Logic
The function `func_1(a, b)` uses the XOR operation to compare the two numbers. The expression `xor_result = a ^ b` will yield a binary number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different. The function then checks two conditions:
1. `xor_result != 0`: This ensures that `a` and `b` are not equal.
2. `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`: This checks that only one bit is different between `a` and `b`. This works because subtracting 1 from a number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit (including that bit itself), so the result of the AND operation should be zero if there is only one bit set in `xor_result`.

### Provided Test Cases
The function is tested against several assertions:
- `func_1(13, 9) == True`: 13 (1101) and 9 (1001) differ at one bit (the second bit).
- `func_1(15, 8) == False`: 15 (1111) and 8 (1000) differ at more than one bit.
- `func_1(2, 4) == False`: 2 (0010) and 4 (0100) differ at more than one bit.
- `func_1(2, 3) == True`: 2 (0010) and 3 (0011) differ at one bit (the first bit).
- `func_1(5, 1) == True`: 5 (0101) and 1 (0001) differ at one bit (the second bit).
- `func_1(1, 5) == True`: This is a symmetric case of the previous one and should also correctly return True.

### Analysis of the Function
The logic appears to be correct, and the test cases provided seem to validate the conditions stated in the problem description. 

### Edge Cases
To verify further, let's consider:
- `func_1(0, 1)`: 0 (0000) and 1 (0001) differ at one bit → Should return `True`.
- `func_1(1, 0)`: 1 and 0 should yield the same result as above → Should return `True`.
- `func_1(0, 0)`: 0 and 0 are equal → Should return `False`.
- `func_1(3, 2)`: 3 (0011) and 2 (0010) differ at one bit → Should return `True`.

After running through these additional test cases, they also yield the expected results according to the function logic.

### Conclusion
Since the function handles all the provided cases correctly and passes additional edge cases, I conclude that the function satisfies the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
