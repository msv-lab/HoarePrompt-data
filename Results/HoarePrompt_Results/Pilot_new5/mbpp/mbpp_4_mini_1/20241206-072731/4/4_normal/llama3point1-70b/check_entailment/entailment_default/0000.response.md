To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python function based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the function and the provided information.

**Problem description**: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
```

**Output hints**: The function accepts two integer parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and returns True if the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` has exactly one bit set to 1 (indicating they differ by exactly one power of two); otherwise, it returns False. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in this implementation.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Function Logic**: The function relies on the principle that the bitwise XOR operation (`^`) between two numbers will produce a result where a `1` indicates that the bits differ in that position. For example:
   - `5 (0101) ^ 4 (0100) = 1 (0001)`
   - Here, the result has exactly one `1`, meaning the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

2. **Counting Bits**: The function uses `bin(...).count('1')` to count how many bits are set to `1`. If the count is `1`, it returns `True`, indicating that the numbers differ by one bit; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- **Cases where both numbers are the same**: If `num1` is equal to `num2`, the result of `num1 ^ num2` will be `0`, which has no bits set. The function will correctly return `False`.
- **Negative Numbers**: The function does not explicitly handle negative integers. The XOR operation and subsequent binary conversion should still work correctly in Python, which handles negative integers in two's complement form. Thus, the core functionality remains intact.
- **Zeros**: If one number is `0` and the other is `1`, the function will return `True`, indicating they differ at one bit position. This seems to be correctly handled.

### Output Hints Evaluation:
The output hints state that the function checks for exactly one bit set to `1` in the XOR result. There are no contradictions or additional edge cases mentioned in those hints that would indicate the function is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to satisfy the problem requirements under various scenarios, including edge cases of negative numbers and zeros. It accurately determines whether two numbers differ by exactly one bit position.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function properly utilizes the XOR operation to check if two numbers differ by exactly one bit position, and it correctly identifies these cases without any apparent edge cases being unhandled.
