Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function uses the bitwise XOR operation (`^`) between `num1` and `num2`, which will result in a binary number where each bit is `1` if the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different and `0` if they are the same. The `bin()` function converts this result into a binary string, and `count('1')` counts the number of differing bits. If this count is exactly one, the function returns `True`, indicating that the two numbers differ at one bit position only, as required by the problem description.

In all potential cases, such as:
- `func_1(2, 3)` → differs at one bit position.
- `func_1(0, 1)` → differs at one bit position.
- `func_1(1, 3)` → differs at two bit positions (should return `False`).

The program behaves as expected. Therefore, it is correct.
