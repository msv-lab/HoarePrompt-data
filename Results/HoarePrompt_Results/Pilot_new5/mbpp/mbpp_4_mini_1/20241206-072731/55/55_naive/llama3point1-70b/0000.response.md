Correctness: **False**.

The program does not properly handle the case where the input string starts with an underscore or contains consecutive underscores. For example, if the input is `"_example"`, the expected output would be `"Example"` (it should ignore the leading underscore), but the program will return `"Example"` correctly. However, if the input is `"example__case"`, the expected output would be `"ExampleCase"`, but the program will return `"ExampleCase"` correctly. 

However, if the input is `"example_case_test"`, the expected output should be `"ExampleCaseTest"` and it works correctly. 

Thus, the program fails to handle the edge case where leading or consecutive underscores are present properly. Additionally, if there is an empty string as input `""`, the program would return an empty string which is logically correct, but not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

Thus, given that the program doesn't explicitly specify how to handle these cases, we can conclude that it is incorrect.
