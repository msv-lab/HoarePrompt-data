Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `snake_str` consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, splits the string into components at the underscores, capitalizes each component, and returns a new string formed by joining these capitalized components without any spaces or underscores. If `snake_str` contains only underscores or is empty, the behavior may not be fully defined since the input should be non-empty according to the precondition. **
