The variable `components` is assigned the result of `snake_str.split('_')`, which splits the string `snake_str` at each underscore and creates a list of the resulting substrings. The value of `components` will depend on the specific content of `snake_str`, but it will be a list of substrings derived from that string. The state of `snake_str` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, underscores, and may not be empty; `components` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `snake_str` at underscores.**
