Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given integer `n` is odd. It does this by evaluating the expression `n % 2 != 0`. 

Here's how the function aligns with the problem description:

- The modulo operator `%` computes the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. 
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will equal 1, and therefore `n % 2 != 0` evaluates to `True`.
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` will equal 0, and thus `n % 2 != 0` evaluates to `False`.

As a result, the function returns `True` for odd numbers (which is what the problem description requires) and `False` for even numbers. 

The function handles all integer inputs correctly, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero, which confirms that it fulfills the requirements of the problem statement. Thus, the implementation is correct.
