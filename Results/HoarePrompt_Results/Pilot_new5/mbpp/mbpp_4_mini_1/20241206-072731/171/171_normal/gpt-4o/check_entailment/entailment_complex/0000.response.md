Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. 

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n)` accepts an integer `n` as input.
2. **Parity Check**: Inside the function, the expression `n % 2 != 0` checks if `n` is odd. The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. If the result is not equal to 0 (`!= 0`), it implies that `n` is odd, thus returning `True`. Conversely, if `n` is even (the result of `n % 2` is 0), it returns `False`.
3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided before the function demonstrate correct usage:
   - `func_1(12)` returns `False` because 12 is even.
   - `func_1(7)` returns `True` because 7 is odd.
   - `func_1(10)` returns `False` because 10 is even.

The program adheres to the problem description by accurately distinguishing between odd and even integers based on their parity. The comments in the code also clarify that the return value is `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. Thus, the implementation is correct.
