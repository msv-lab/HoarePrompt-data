The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `target`, returning the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` is not found, it returns -1. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is empty, but it will correctly return -1 for such scenarios as well. Additionally, it assumes that `arr` contains comparable elements and does not handle any exceptions that might arise from invalid comparisons.
