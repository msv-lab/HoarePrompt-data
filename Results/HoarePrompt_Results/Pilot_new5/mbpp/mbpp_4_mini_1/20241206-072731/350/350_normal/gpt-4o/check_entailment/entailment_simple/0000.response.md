Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` finds the last position of a specified element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it fulfills the problem requirements:

1. **Iteration from the End**: The function iterates through the list `arr` from the last index to the first index. This is crucial for finding the last occurrence of the element `x`.

2. **Equality Check**: Within the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to `x`. If it finds a match, it immediately returns the index `i`, which represents the last occurrence of `x` in the sorted array.

3. **Return -1 If Not Found**: If the loop completes without finding `x`, the function returns `-1`, indicating that `x` is not present in `arr`. This meets the expected behavior as outlined in the problem description.

4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the code validate the correctness of the implementation against various scenarios, including cases where the element appears multiple times, only once, or not at all.

In summary, the function behaves as required by the problem description, successfully identifying the last position of an element in a sorted array or returning -1 if the element is absent. Thus, the program is correct.
