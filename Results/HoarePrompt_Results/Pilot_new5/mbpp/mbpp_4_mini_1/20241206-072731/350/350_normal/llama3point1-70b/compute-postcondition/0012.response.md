The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a sorted list of elements, and `target` is the element whose last position needs to be found in `arr`. 

The function has multiple cases for its return values:
- **Case 1**: If the last element of `arr` is equal to `target`, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
- **Case 2**: If the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`, and `arr` contains at least 2 elements, the function returns `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 2`.
- **Case 3**: If `arr` contains at least 2 elements, the function returns the value of `i`, which is `len(arr) - 3`.
- **Case 4**: If `target` is not found in the sorted list `arr`, the function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list `arr` and a `target` element, and then determine the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr`, or indicate if `target` is not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `target`, returning the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr`, or -1 if `target` is not found.**
