According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. The loop will iterate backwards through the indices of `arr`, starting from the last index (which is `len(arr) - 1`) and ending at 0. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will have the last index of the array. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `arr` must not be empty, and `i` will start from `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
