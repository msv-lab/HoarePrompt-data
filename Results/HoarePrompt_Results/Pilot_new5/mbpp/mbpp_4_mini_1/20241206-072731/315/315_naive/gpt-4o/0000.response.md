Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly adds the elements of the given tuple to the end of the provided list. The implementation uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the converted tuple (to a list) which ensures all elements are added correctly. 

The assertions provided in the test cases demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. Additionally, it handles edge cases like adding an empty tuple to a list, which would correctly return the original list. Since I couldn't find any potential cases where the function would not perform as described, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
