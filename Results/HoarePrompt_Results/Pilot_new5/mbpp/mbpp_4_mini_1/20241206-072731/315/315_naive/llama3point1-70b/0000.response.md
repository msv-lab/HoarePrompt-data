Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as input and correctly concatenates the list with the elements of the tuple converted to a list. It handles all potential cases:

1. If the input list is empty and the tuple is also empty, it will return an empty list.
2. If the tuple has one or more elements, it will correctly add each element of the tuple to the list.
3. The function does not alter the original list or tuple, it simply returns a new list containing the concatenated result.

Thus, the function meets the requirements described in the problem statement for all potential cases.
