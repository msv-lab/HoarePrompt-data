Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the specified functionality of adding a tuple to a list. The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `input_list`, which is expected to be a list, and `input_tuple`, which is expected to be a tuple. The program converts the tuple to a list using `list(input_tuple)` and then concatenates this list to the original list using the `+` operator.

This approach correctly handles the addition of the tuple elements to the list. The program also will not raise any errors for typical use cases, such as when the input list is empty or when the input tuple is empty. 

For example:
- If `input_list` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `input_tuple` is `(4, 5)`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- If `input_list` is `[]` and `input_tuple` is `(1,)`, the output will be `[1]`.
- If `input_list` is `[1]` and `input_tuple` is `()`, the output will be `[1]`.

Since I cannot identify any potential cases where this implementation fails to meet the problem requirements, I conclude that the code is correct.
