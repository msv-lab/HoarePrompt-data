Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should add the given tuple to the given list, which implies modifying the original list by appending the elements of the tuple to it. However, the provided program returns a new list created by concatenating the original list and the elements of the tuple converted into a list, rather than modifying the original list. 

For example, if the input is `input_list = [1, 2, 3]` and `input_tuple = (4, 5)`, the function returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is a new list rather than adding the tuple's elements to the existing list. The desired behavior should modify `input_list` to become `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` instead.

Thus, the function does not meet the problem's requirement to "add the given tuple to the given list" in a manner that modifies the original list.
