To assess the correctness of the given Python program, we examine the problem description and the code itself first.

### Problem description:
The task is to add a given tuple to a given list. 

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)

# Test cases:
assert func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
assert func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11)) == [6, 7, 8, 10, 11]
assert func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12)) == [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]
```

### Output hints:
The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` converted to a list. It handles any length of `lst` and `tpl`, including empty lists or tuples, correctly appending the elements of `tpl` to `lst`.

### Initial assessment:
The code correctly concatenates a list and a tuple by converting the tuple to a list and then using the `+` operator to combine the two. This aligns with the problem description which specifies that the tuple should be added to the list.

### Edge cases:
1. **Empty List and Empty Tuple**: 
   - If `lst` is `[]` and `tpl` is `()`, the output should be `[]`. The code should handle this case correctly.
   
2. **Empty List**: 
   - If `lst` is `[]` and `tpl` is `(1, 2)`, the output should be `[1, 2]`. The code should handle this correctly.
   
3. **Empty Tuple**: 
   - If `lst` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `tpl` is `()`, the output should be `[1, 2, 3]`. The code should handle this correctly as well.
   
4. **Tuple of Length 1**: 
   - If `lst` is `[1]` and `tpl` is `(2,)`, the output should be `[1, 2]`. The code should handle this case correctly.

5. **Non-empty list and tuple with varied types**:
   - If `lst` is `[1, 2]` and `tpl` is `(3.5, "four")`, the output should be `[1, 2, 3.5, "four"]`. The code should accommodate mixed types.

### Output hints validation:
The output hints state that the function handles any length of `lst` and `tpl`, including empty lists or tuples. This correctly reflects the behavior of the code as all edge cases I considered will yield the expected results based on the code logic.

### Conclusion:
The code adheres to the problem description and handles various edge cases correctly. There are no identified scenarios where the code fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
