Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst, tpl)` is designed to take a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and it returns a new list that concatenates the elements of `lst` with the elements of `tpl`, after converting `tpl` to a list.

Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Types**: The function accepts a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`), as specified in the problem description.
2. **Concatenation**: It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list with the elements of the tuple converted to a list using `list(tpl)`. This matches the requirement of "adding the given tuple to the given list."
3. **Returning a New List**: The function returns a new list that contains all elements from `lst` followed by the elements from `tpl`, which is exactly what the problem asks for.

The provided assertions in the annotated program verify that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, all of which pass successfully. Thus, it demonstrates that the function consistently adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description.
