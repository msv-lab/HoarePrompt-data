Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list as an input and returns a tuple containing all elements from that list. The use of the built-in `tuple()` function effectively converts the input list, regardless of the data types of its elements, into a tuple format.

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases, demonstrating that the function behaves as expected for various lists:

- For the input `[5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]`, the output is `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`, which confirms that the list has been correctly converted to a tuple.
- Similarly, the other assertions confirm the same behavior for different lists.

Since the function performs as specified in the problem description for all tested cases, we can conclude that the program is correct. It will always convert a list to a tuple, fulfilling the requirements for any potential input list.
