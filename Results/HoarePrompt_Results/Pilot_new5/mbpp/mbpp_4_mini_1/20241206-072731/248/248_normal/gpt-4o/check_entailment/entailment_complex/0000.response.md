Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which states that the function must convert a list to a tuple. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and uses the `tuple()` constructor to convert this list into a tuple. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

2. **Correct Output**: The assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs. For example:
   - When given the input `[5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]`, the output is `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`, which is the expected tuple representation of the list.
   - It also handles other cases, such as `[2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]` and `[58, 44, 56]`, returning the correct tuple outputs in each case.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although the function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as an empty list, it is worth noting that the behavior in such cases is still correct. An empty list passed to `tuple()` will indeed return an empty tuple `()`, which aligns with expected behavior.

Overall, the implementation correctly converts a list of any data type to a corresponding tuple, satisfying the implementation requirements in the problem description. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
