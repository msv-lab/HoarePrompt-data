Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as input and converts it to a tuple. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works as expected for the given test cases. The function handles various list contents, including integers and duplicate values, and returns the correct tuple representation without any errors. There are no edge cases or scenarios presented in the problem description that would cause the function to fail, and I cannot think of any potential cases where it might not perform correctly.
