The variable `n` is converted to a string using the `str()` function. Since `n` is initially a positive integer, after execution, `n` will now hold its string representation. The other variables and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, now represented as a string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, now represented as a string.**
