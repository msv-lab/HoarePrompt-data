The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the digits of `n` form an undulating pattern (i.e., each digit either increases and then decreases or decreases and then increases). It returns True if the digits form such a pattern, and False otherwise. The function assumes that `n` is at least 100, as it relies on the length of the string representation of `n`. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than 100, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such cases are provided.
