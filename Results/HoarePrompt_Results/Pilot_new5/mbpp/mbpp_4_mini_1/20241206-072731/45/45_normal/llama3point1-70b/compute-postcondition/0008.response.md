Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer represented as a string that is at least "100" and `i` is 1. If the digit at position `i` is either greater than both its neighbors or less than both its neighbors, the condition holds. Otherwise, `undulating` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
