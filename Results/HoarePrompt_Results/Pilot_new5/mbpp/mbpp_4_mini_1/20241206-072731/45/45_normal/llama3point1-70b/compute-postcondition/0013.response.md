Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer represented as a string that is at least "100" and `i` is 2. If the digit at position `i` is a local extremum (either less than its neighbors in an increasing sequence or greater than its neighbors in a decreasing sequence), then the condition holds true. Otherwise, if the condition does not hold, `undulating` is set to False, indicating that the structure is not undulating, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
