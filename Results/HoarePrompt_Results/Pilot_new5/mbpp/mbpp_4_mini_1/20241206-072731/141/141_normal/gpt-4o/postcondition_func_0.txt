The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string, and counts the frequency of each digit. It returns False if any digit's count exceeds its integer value; otherwise, it returns True. The function handles the case where `n` is 0 correctly, returning True since the count of '0' does not exceed its integer value. There are no additional edge cases or missing functionalities.
