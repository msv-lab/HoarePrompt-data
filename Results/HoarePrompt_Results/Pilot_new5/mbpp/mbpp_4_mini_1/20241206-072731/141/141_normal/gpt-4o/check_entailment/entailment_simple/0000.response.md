Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem described. The problem requires that the frequency of each digit in the integer must be less than or equal to the digit itself. However, the current implementation does not account for the condition that the digit '0' should not have any frequency greater than 0, as it is not permissible to have any digit appear more times than its value. 

For example, consider the case `func_1(51241)`. The frequency of the digits is as follows:
- '5' occurs 1 time
- '1' occurs 1 time
- '2' occurs 1 time
- '4' occurs 1 time
- '0' does not occur at all

The program logic correctly handles these counts but fails to handle cases where digits are '0'. Specifically, if a digit such as '2' occurs twice, it violates the problem's requirement because '2' can only occur twice, but '0' cannot occur at all. 

The implementation currently returns `True` for `1234`, but it does not consider that '0' should not appear if `n` contains any other digits, reflecting that the count of '0' must be 0 as 0 cannot contribute to frequency positively.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, particularly regarding the digit '0' and when other digits occur more than their value.
