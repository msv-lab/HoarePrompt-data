Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representing `n`, and the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` exceeds the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no action taken.***
