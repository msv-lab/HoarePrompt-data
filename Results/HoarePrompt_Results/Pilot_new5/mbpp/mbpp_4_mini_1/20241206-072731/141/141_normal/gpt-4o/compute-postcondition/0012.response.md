According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `digit_str`, which is used to iterate over its characters. The loop will continue executing as long as there are characters left in `digit_str`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, and we are processing the characters of its string representation, `digit_str`. Since the loop iterates over the characters one by one, for the loop to execute one more time, `digit_str` must contain at least one more character to process. 

If we denote the current index of iteration over `digit_str` as `index`, after the previous iteration, `index` would need to be incremented to point to the next character. Therefore, if `digit` is the character at the current index, for the next iteration, we need to increment `index` by 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, digit_str must have at least one more character, index is incremented by 1**
