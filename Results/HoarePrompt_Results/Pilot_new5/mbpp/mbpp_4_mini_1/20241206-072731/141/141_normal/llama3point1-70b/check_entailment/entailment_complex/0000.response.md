Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(n)` is defined to take a non-negative integer `n`. As per the problem description, it is expected to check the frequency of each digit in the integer, and the implementation correctly assumes that `n` is non-negative.

2. **String Conversion**: The integer `n` is converted to its string representation, which allows for easy iteration over each digit. This aligns with the requirement to analyze the frequency of digits within `n`.

3. **Count Check**: Within the loop, the program checks whether the count of each digit (obtained via `str_n.count(digit)`) is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit (converted back from string to integer with `int(digit)`). This directly corresponds to the condition specified in the problem description.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns `False` as soon as it finds a digit whose frequency exceeds its value, which is necessary for the logic outlined in the problem. If no such condition is found after checking all digits, it returns `True`, confirming that all digits meet the specified criteria.

5. **Correct Logic Flow**: The comments provided in the code accurately reflect the state of the program at different stages, confirming that the logic is correctly followed throughout.

Since the function effectively checks each digit's frequency against its value as required by the problem description, it operates correctly for all valid non-negative integer inputs. Thus, the program adheres to the specifications provided.
