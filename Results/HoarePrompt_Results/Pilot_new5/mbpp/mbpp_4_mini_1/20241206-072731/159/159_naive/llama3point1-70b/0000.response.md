Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). It takes the radius and height as inputs and returns the computed volume. The use of `math.pi` for the value of \(\pi\) ensures that the calculation is accurate. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to yield an incorrect result, as it handles all valid inputs for radius and height (assuming they are non-negative). Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
