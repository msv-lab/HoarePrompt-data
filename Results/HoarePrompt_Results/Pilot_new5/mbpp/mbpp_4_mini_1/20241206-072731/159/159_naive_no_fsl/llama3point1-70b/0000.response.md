Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the equation:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

Where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone, and \( h \) is the height of the cone. 

The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and computes the volume accordingly. 

I considered various cases including:
1. Positive values for radius and height.
2. Zero for radius or height (which would yield a volume of 0, as expected).
3. Negative values for radius or height (though the context of the problem suggests those would be invalid inputs).

In all cases that I considered, including edge cases, the function behaves correctly by returning the expected volume based on the formula. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
