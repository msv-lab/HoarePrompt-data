#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is equal to \(8 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2\) for the given non-negative integer n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even numbers. Specifically, it computes this sum as \(8 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2\).
