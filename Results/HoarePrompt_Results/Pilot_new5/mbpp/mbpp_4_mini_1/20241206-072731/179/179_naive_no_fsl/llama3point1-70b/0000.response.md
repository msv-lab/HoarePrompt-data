To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

**Analysis of the program:**
1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents how many even natural numbers we want to consider.
2. The range `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2`. This correctly generates the first `n` even natural numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.
3. The generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` computes the cube of each of these even numbers.
4. The `sum` function then adds these cubes together.

**Testing the program with various inputs:**
- For `n = 1`: The first even number is 2. The cube is \(2^3 = 8\). The program will return 8, which is correct.
- For `n = 2`: The first two even numbers are 2 and 4. The cubes are \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\). The program will return 72, which is correct.
- For `n = 3`: The first three even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The cubes are \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\). The program will return 288, which is correct.
- For `n = 0`: The sum of the first 0 even natural numbers should be 0. The function will return 0, which is also correct.
- For negative values of `n`: The program uses `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`, which will not yield any numbers if `n` is negative, and thus will return 0. This might not align with expectations since the problem does not define behavior for negative values of `n`.

**Conclusion:**
The code functions correctly for non-negative integers. However, it does not handle the case where `n` is negative properly, as the expected behavior for negative inputs is not defined in the problem statement. 

Thus, the correctness of the program can be evaluated as follows:

Correctness: **False** 

**Reason:** The program does not handle negative values of `n` correctly, as it will simply return 0 without raising an error or providing feedback.
