The value of `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`. The initial state indicates that `max_sum` is negative infinity, and `current_sum` is the sum of `sublist`, which is the second inner list of `list_of_lists`. Therefore, after the execution, `max_sum` will now hold the value of `current_sum`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list, `current_sum` is the sum of `sublist`.**
