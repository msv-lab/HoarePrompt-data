Postcondition: ***`max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list, and `current_sum` is the sum of `sublist`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is set to `sublist`.***
