The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value `float('-inf')`, which represents negative infinity in Python. This sets `max_sum` to a very small value, which can be used to compare with the sums of the inner lists later in the program. The state of the other variables, particularly `list_of_lists`, remains unchanged as this line of code does not affect it.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements; `max_sum` is set to negative infinity.**
