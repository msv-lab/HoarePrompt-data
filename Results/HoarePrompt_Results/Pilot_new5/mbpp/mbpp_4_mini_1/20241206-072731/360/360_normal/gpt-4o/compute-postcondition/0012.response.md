Postcondition: ***`max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, and `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 inner lists. If `current_sum` (the sum of the elements in `sublist`, which is the second inner list) is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is set to `sublist`.***
