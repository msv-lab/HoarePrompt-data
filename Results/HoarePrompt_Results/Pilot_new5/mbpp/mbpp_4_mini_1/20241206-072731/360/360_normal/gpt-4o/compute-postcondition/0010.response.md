The value of `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`. Since `current_sum` is defined as the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` will now hold this calculated value. The other variables retain their values as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
