Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly attempts to return the first element of each sublist, it presumes that each sublist contains at least one element. The comment states, "sublists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains at least one element," but the code does not enforce this condition.

If any sublist is empty, the program will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the first element of a sublist without checking if the sublist is empty. This violates the problem description's requirement to return the first element of each sublist, as it would not handle the case where a sublist could be empty.

Therefore, since the function does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description, it is incorrect.
