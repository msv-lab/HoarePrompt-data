Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(arr)` correctly identifies whether there are duplicate elements in the given list `arr`. It does this by comparing the length of the original list with the length of the set created from that list. A set inherently removes duplicates, so if the lengths differ, it indicates that duplicates were present in the original list. 

The function works for all potential cases:
- An empty list returns `False` (no duplicates).
- A list with all unique elements returns `False`.
- A list with any duplicates returns `True`.

Since it handles these scenarios accurately, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
