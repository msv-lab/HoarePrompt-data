According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr` list. The loop will continue as long as there are more integers in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 2 integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `arr` must have at least 3 integers, and the next `num` will be the third integer in the list. Since `num` is the second integer at the end of the last iteration, after this iteration, `num` will be updated to the next integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, `seen` is a set containing `num`**
