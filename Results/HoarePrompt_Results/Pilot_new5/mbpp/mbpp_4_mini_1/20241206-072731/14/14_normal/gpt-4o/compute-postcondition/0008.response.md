Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that contains at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, and `seen` is a set containing `num`. If `num` is in `seen`, the function returns True indicating that a condition has been satisfied based on the presence of `num`. There is no else part in the code.***
