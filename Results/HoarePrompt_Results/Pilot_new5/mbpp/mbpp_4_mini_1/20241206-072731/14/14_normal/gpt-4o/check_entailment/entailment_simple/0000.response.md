The program provided is designed to determine whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. Let's analyze it based on the problem description.

### Problem Description
The function must identify if there are any duplicate integers in a given list.

### Program Analysis
1. The function `func_1(arr)` utilizes a set `seen` to keep track of the integers that have been encountered.
2. It iterates over each integer `num` in the input list `arr`:
   - If `num` is already in the `seen` set, it returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate has been found.
   - If `num` is not in the `seen` set, it adds `num` to the `seen` set.
3. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`, indicating that there are no duplicates in the list.

### Correctness Verification
- The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases:
  - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output is `False`, correctly indicating no duplicates.
  - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, the output is `True`, correctly identifying a duplicate (the second `4`).
  - For the input `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, the output is `True`, also correctly identifying duplicates.

### Conclusion
The function adheres to the problem description, as it correctly identifies the presence of duplicate integers in the input list. The logic used is sound and efficiently checks for duplicates by leveraging a set to store unique values, ensuring that the function operates correctly for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
