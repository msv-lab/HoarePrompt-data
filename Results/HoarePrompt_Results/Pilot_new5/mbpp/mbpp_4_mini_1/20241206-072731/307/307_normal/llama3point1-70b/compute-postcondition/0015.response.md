Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 6 with its string representation having a length less than `n`. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns the value of `idx`, which is 3. Otherwise, the function returns None.***
