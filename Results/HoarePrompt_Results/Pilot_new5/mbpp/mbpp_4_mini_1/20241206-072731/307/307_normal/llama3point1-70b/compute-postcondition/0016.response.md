The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was 3, so after the execution, `idx` will be 4. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 4, and `triangular_num` is 6 with its string representation having a length less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 4, and `triangular_num` is 6 with its string representation having a length less than `n`.**
