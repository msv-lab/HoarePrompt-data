Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the task of finding the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits, as specified in the problem description.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Triangular Numbers**: The program calculates triangular numbers using the formula `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. This formula accurately generates the nth triangular number as required.

2. **Count of Digits**: The program checks the number of digits in the triangular number by converting it to a string and measuring its length with `len(str(triangular_num))`. This method is appropriate for determining the number of digits in a number.

3. **Condition for Return**: The program checks if the length of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n` (`if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:`). If this condition is satisfied, it returns the current index `idx`, which represents the position of the triangular number with at least `n` digits.

4. **Incrementing the Index**: If the condition is not met, the index is incremented, and the loop continues until the condition is met.

5. **Termination**: The loop is guaranteed to terminate because as `idx` increases, the triangular number will eventually exceed any finite value of `n` in terms of the number of digits.

Overall, the program meets the problem requirements and handles the task as specified. For any positive integer input `n`, the program will yield the correct index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.
