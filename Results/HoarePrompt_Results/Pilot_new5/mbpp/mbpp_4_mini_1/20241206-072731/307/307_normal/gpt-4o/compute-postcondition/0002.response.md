The variable `triangular_number` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is initially 1, we can calculate `triangular_number` as follows: 

`triangular_number = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 1 * 2 // 2 = 2 // 2 = 1`.

The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `triangular_number` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `triangular_number` is 1.**
