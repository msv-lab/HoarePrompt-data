The value of `triangular_num` is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 1, we have:

- `triangular_num = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2`
- `triangular_num = 1 * 2 // 2`
- `triangular_num = 2 // 2`
- `triangular_num = 1`

The initial state of `n` being a positive integer remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the calculation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `idx` is 1; `triangular_num` is 1**.
