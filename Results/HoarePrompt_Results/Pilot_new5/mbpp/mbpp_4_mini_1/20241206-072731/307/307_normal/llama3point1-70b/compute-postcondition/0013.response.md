The value of `triangular_num` is calculated using the formula for the nth triangular number, which is `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 3, we compute:

```
triangular_num = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2
                = 3 * 4 // 2
                = 12 // 2
                = 6
```

The initial state mentions that `triangular_num` is 3; after executing the code, it will be updated to 6. The other variables, `n` and `idx`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 6 with its string representation having a length less than `n`.**
