According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute indefinitely unless there is an external break condition that is not shown here. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3**.
