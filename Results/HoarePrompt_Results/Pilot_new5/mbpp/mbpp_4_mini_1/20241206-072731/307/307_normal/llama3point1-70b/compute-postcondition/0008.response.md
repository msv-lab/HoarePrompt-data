`triangular_num` is assigned the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 2, we can calculate this as follows: `triangular_num = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 * 3 // 2 = 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is now "3") is still less than `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `idx` is 2; `triangular_num` is 3; the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
