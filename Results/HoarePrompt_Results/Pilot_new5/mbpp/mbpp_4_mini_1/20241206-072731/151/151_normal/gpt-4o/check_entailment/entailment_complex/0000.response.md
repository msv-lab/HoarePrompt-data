Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. 

Here's the reasoning behind the correctness:

1. **Function Structure:** The function `func_1` takes a parameter `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that may contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any level.

2. **Recursive Flattening:** The function uses recursion to handle nested lists. It iterates over each item in the `nested_list`. If the item is itself a list, it calls `func_1` on that sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the result, effectively flattening it.

3. **Appending Non-List Items:** If the item is not a list (i.e., it's an integer), the function appends it directly to `flat_list`. This ensures that all non-list elements are collected in the order they appear in the original nested list structure.

4. **Return Value:** After the loop completes, `flat_list` contains all the non-list elements from `nested_list`, thus achieving the goal of flattening the list.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:** The function properly handles cases where:
   - The input list is empty (`[]`), returning an empty list.
   - Nested lists of varying depths are correctly flattened regardless of their complexity.

6. **Assertions:** The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for multiple test cases, returning the expected flattened results.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly flattening nested lists to a single list of integers, handling any level of nesting without altering the original input.
