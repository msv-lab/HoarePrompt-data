The variable `flat_list` is an empty list initially. The variable `nested_list` contains at least one item, and `item` is the first item in `nested_list`, which is a list. The code calls `func_1(item)` and extends `flat_list` with the result of that function.

The impact of the code on the program is that `flat_list` will now contain the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. Since `item` is a list, the function `func_1(item)` is expected to process `item` in some way, and the resulting elements will be added to `flat_list`. However, the specific output of `func_1(item)` is not provided in the initial state.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated state of `flat_list` and the unchanged states of the other variables while acknowledging the effect of extending `flat_list`.

Output State: **`flat_list` is the result of extending an empty list with the output of `func_1(item)`, `nested_list` must have at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in `nested_list`, and `item` is a list.**
