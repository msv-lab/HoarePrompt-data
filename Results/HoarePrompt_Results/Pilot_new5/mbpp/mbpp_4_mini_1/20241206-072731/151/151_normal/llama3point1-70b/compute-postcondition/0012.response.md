The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` updates the `flat_list` by extending it with the result of the function `func_1(i)` applied to the variable `i`, which is the third element of `nested_list`. The variable `i` is taken directly from `nested_list`, and `flat_list` is modified accordingly by appending the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.

Since `flat_list` is updated, its previous state is unknown, but it is modified to include new elements based on the output of `func_1(i)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` is updated with the elements returned by `func_1(i)`**.
