According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` has at least one element, the loop can potentially execute again for the next element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, the current element `i` has been processed, but we need to determine what the next element will be in order for the loop to execute one more time.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to specify the conditions for the new `i`:

1. `nested_list` must have another element available after the current `i` has been processed.
2. The next `i` could either be a list or a non-list element, but that detail does not change the iteration count.

Therefore, if `nested_list` has at least two elements, we can say the next element will be at the same index plus one.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `flat_list` could be updated based on the next element in the list, and `i` will be the second element in `nested_list`**.
