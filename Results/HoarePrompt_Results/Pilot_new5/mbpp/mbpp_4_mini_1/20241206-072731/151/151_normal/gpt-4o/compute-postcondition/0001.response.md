According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list is not empty, the loop will execute at least once. Since `flat_list` is an empty list and does not affect the execution of the loop, it can remain as is. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nested_list` must contain at least one item. The variable `item` should also represent the first element in `nested_list` during the first iteration.

State: **`flat_list` is an empty list, `nested_list` must have at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in `nested_list`**
