Output State: **`flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list`, which may contain integers or other lists, or a combination of both. The length of `flat_list` depends on the total number of non-list elements and the elements returned by `func_1` applied to any sublists. `nested_list` is unchanged from its initial state. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` will also be an empty list.**
