Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. 

### Explanation:

1. **Recursive Approach**: The function `func_1` uses a recursive approach to handle lists that may contain other lists. This is essential for flattening nested structures of arbitrary depth.

2. **Type Checking**: The program checks if each element `i` in `nested_list` is a list using `type(i) == list`. If it is a list, the function calls itself recursively to flatten that list. If it is not a list, it appends the element directly to `flat_list`.

3. **Flattening Logic**: The use of the `extend` method on `flat_list` ensures that all elements from the recursively flattened list are added to `flat_list`, thereby maintaining the flattened structure.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: If `nested_list` is empty, the function will simply return an empty list as expected, which complies with the problem description stating that if `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` should remain empty.

5. **Final Output**: The program returns `flat_list`, which is guaranteed to contain all non-list elements from the original nested list, effectively achieving the goal of flattening the structure.

Overall, the program adheres to the requirements of the problem description by correctly flattening any nested list structure provided to it.
