The code appends the value of `i` to the `flat_list`. Since `i` is defined as the first element in `nested_list` and is not a list, the state of `flat_list` will be updated to include `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated condition of `flat_list` while acknowledging the preconditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, and `i` is not a list; `flat_list` now contains `i`**.
