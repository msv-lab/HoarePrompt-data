Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple `numbers` as input, which is correctly specified to have a length of `N+1` (where N is the desired output length, which will be `N`).

2. **Output Specification**: The function is supposed to return a tuple of length `N`, where the i-th element is the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple. The program achieves this by using `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, which pairs each element with its subsequent element. 

3. **Multiplication Logic**: The multiplication of the pairs `(a, b)` is done using a generator expression that iterates over the zipped pairs. This ensures that for each index `i`, the product `t_i * t_{i+1}` is calculated, fulfilling the requirement of the problem.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: If the input tuple has fewer than two elements (i.e., length 0 or 1), the generator expression will not yield any products, effectively returning an empty tuple. This behavior aligns with the expectation that if there are not enough elements to form pairs, the function should return an empty tuple.

In summary, the function correctly computes the products of adjacent elements in the input tuple according to the provided problem description, thus confirming its correctness.
