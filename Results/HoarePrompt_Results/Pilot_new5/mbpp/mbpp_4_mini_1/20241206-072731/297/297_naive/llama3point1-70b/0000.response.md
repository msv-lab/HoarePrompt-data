To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to take a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})` and return a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))

```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Type**: The function expects a tuple of numbers.
2. **Logic**: The function uses `zip` to pair each element `a` in `numbers` with its next element `b` in `numbers[1:]`. It multiplies these pairs and constructs a new tuple from the results.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- If the input tuple has only one element (e.g., `(5,)`), the function will attempt to create pairs with an empty tuple `()` from `numbers[1:]`. This means that `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` will yield no pairs, resulting in an empty tuple `()`, which is not the expected output based on the problem description.
  
- If the input tuple has two elements (e.g., `(2, 3)`), the output will be `(2 * 3,)`, which is correct. However, the case where there is only one element is a failure point that the program does not handle.

### Conclusion:
Since there exists at least one input (a tuple with one element) where the function does not return the expected output (it would return an empty tuple instead), the program is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
