Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly implements the requirement of checking whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

- In the first assertion, the list `['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white']` has items that are not equal to `'blue'`, so the function correctly returns `False`.
- In the second assertion, the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` does not contain the element `7`, so it correctly returns `False`.
- In the third assertion, all items in the list `['green', 'green', 'green', 'green']` are equal to `'green'`, so the function returns `True`.

The logic in the `func_1` function checks each item in the list against the provided element and returns `False` as soon as it finds a mismatch. If it finishes checking all items without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`. 

As there are no edge cases or potential inputs where the function does not behave as described, the program is correct.
