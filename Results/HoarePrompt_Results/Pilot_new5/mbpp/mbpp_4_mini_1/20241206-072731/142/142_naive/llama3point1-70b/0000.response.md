Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. It uses the `all()` function along with a generator expression to evaluate each item in the list. If the list is empty, `all()` will return `True`, which adheres to the concept that all elements (or the absence of elements) in an empty list can be considered equal to the `element`. Thus, the function works correctly for all potential cases including lists of different lengths and types.
