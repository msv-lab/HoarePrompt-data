Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is correctly implemented according to the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. The function takes a list (`lst`) and an `element` as input.
2. It iterates through each item in the list and checks if it is equal to the provided `element`.
3. If it finds any item that is not equal to the `element`, it immediately returns `False`.
4. If all items in the list are equal to the `element`, it returns `True` after the loop finishes.

The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves correctly:
- The first assertion checks that a list containing different colors returns `False` when compared to 'blue'.
- The second assertion checks that a list of integers returns `False` when compared to '7', which is also not present in the list.
- The third assertion checks that a list of identical strings returns `True` when compared to 'green'.

Additionally, the function correctly handles edge cases:
- If the list is empty, it will return `True`, as there are no elements that would contradict the condition (an empty list has no items that are not equal to the element).
- It works regardless of the type of elements in the list (as demonstrated with both strings and integers).

Since no potential case has been found where the function does not work as expected, the code is correct.
