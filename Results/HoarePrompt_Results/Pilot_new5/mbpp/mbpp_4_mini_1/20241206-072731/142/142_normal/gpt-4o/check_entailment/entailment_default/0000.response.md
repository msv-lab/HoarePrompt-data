To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze it step by step.

**Problem description:** The function should check if all items in the list are equal to a given element.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It returns `True` if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element` or if `lst` is empty. It returns `False` if any element in `lst` is not equal to `element`.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function iterates through each item in the list.
2. If any item is found that is not equal to the given element, it returns `False`.
3. If it successfully checks all items without finding a mismatch, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases:
- An important edge case to consider is when the list `lst` is empty. According to the problem description, if the list is empty, the function should return `True`, as there are no elements that contradict the condition that they are all equal to the given element.
- However, the current implementation does not explicitly check for this case and would return `True` because the loop would not execute at all.

### Output Hints Verification:
- The output hints state that the function should return `True` if `lst` is empty. This aligns with the idea that an empty list satisfies the condition of "all items are equal to the given element" because there are no items to contradict this.
- The provided assertions in the program seem to validate the functionality for non-empty lists correctly.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle the edge case of an empty list correctly. It is supposed to return `True` for an empty list but does not have a specific check for this condition.

Thus, since the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. For an empty list, it should return `True`, but the current implementation does not account for this, leading to incorrect behavior.
