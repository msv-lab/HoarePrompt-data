Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Here's why it meets the specifications:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and an `element`.

2. **Checking Equality**: Inside the function, it iterates through each `item` in the list `lst`. If it finds any `item` that is not equal to the `element`, it immediately returns `False`. This ensures that the function can accurately determine if all items in the list are equal to the given `element`.

3. **Return True for All Equal Elements**: If the loop completes without finding any unequal items, the function returns `True`, which signifies that all elements in the list are equal to the provided `element`.

4. **Handling Empty List**: The function correctly handles the case of an empty list. If `lst` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns `True`, which aligns with the requirement that it should return `True` when all elements (or none, in this case) are equal to the `element`.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases that check the correctness of the function against various scenarios (including lists with different types of elements and an empty list).

Therefore, the function adheres to the specifications laid out in the problem description and correctly checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element, including handling an empty list scenario appropriately.
