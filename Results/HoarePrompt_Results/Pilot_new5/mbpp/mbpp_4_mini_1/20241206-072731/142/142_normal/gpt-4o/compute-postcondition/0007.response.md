According to the code, the loop iterates over each `item` in the `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `item` is the second element of `lst`. Since `lst` has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 3 elements in `lst`. The next `item` will be the third element in `lst`.

State: **`lst` is a list with at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in the list**
