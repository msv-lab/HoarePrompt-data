The program provided is designed to check if all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. The function `func_1` utilizes Python's built-in `all()` function in conjunction with a generator expression to evaluate whether every item in the list matches the provided element.

Let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Initial Assessment**:
    - The function takes two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `element`, which can be of any data type.
    - The use of `all()` ensures that the function returns `True` only if every item in `lst` is equal to `element`. If `lst` is empty, `all()` returns `True` by definition, which aligns with the problem description stating that it should return `True` for an empty list (the condition holds vacuously).
  
2. **Edge Cases**:
    - The function should handle lists containing various data types, including integers, strings, and even nested lists. However, it should also accurately return `False` for lists that have mixed types or where any item does not match the `element`.

3. **Output Hints**:
    - The output hints confirm the function's behavior: it returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise. The hints also indicate that the function can handle any data type and correctly returns `True` for an empty list, which is consistent with the code.

4. **Confirmation Against Edge Cases**:
    - The function will return `True` for lists such as `[]`, `[1, 1, 1]` with `element` as `1`, and `['a', 'a']` with `element` as `'a'`.
    - It will return `False` for lists like `[1, 2, 3]` with `element` as `1`, or `['a', 'b']` with `element` as `'a'`.
    - The function should also account for lists containing `None` or mixed types, e.g., `[None, None]` with `element` as `None` should return `True`, whereas `[None, 1]` with `element` as `None` should return `False`.

The program appears to implement the requirements from the problem description correctly and handles edge cases adequately, including the handling of an empty list.

**Correctness: True**. 

The function correctly evaluates whether all items in the list are equal to the specified element, including handling various data types and the empty list scenario.
