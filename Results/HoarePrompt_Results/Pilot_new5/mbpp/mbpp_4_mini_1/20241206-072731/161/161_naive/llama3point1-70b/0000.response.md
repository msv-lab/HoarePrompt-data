Correctness: **True**.

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The function `func_1(n)` accurately checks for the base cases for n = 0 and n = 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For all other values of n, it uses a loop to compute the n-th Lucas number iteratively, maintaining the correct relationships between subsequent Lucas numbers. 

The logic in the loop correctly updates the values of `a` and `b` to represent L(n-1) and L(n) respectively, ensuring that the final return value is indeed the n-th Lucas number. Since all edge cases and the main requirements are handled correctly, the program is correctly implemented based on the problem description.
