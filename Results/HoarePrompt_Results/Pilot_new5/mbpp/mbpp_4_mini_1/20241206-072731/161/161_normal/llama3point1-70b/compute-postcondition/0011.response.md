According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `_` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable is 3 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the current loop variable (which is 3) will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, loop variable is 4**
