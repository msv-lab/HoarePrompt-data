The problem description states that the function should find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

Now, looking at the provided code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

The code correctly returns 2 for `n = 0` and 1 for `n = 1`, aligning with the Lucas number definitions. For `n > 1`, the function initializes `a` to 2 (L(0)) and `b` to 1 (L(1)), and it attempts to compute the next Lucas numbers using the loop. However, it incorrectly computes the n-th number as it actually returns the (n-1)th Fibonacci number instead of the n-th Lucas number due to how the values of `a` and `b` are updated. 

**Edge Case Analysis:**
For example, when `n = 2`, it should return L(2) = 3, but the function would return 1, since it only adds the previous two numbers starting from L(0) and L(1). 

Now, let's examine the Output hints:

The output hints mention: "The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 2 if `n` is 0, 1 if `n` is 1, and the nth Fibonacci number for all other positive values of `n` greater than 1." 

This implies the function does not compute Lucas numbers for `n > 1` but rather computes Fibonacci numbers instead, which contradicts the function's purpose of finding the n-th Lucas number.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, particularly for `n > 1`.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function is incorrect because it computes Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers for n > 1. For example, for n = 2, the expected output is 3 (L(2)), but the function returns 1 instead.
