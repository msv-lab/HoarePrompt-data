According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates starting from 2 and continues while the variable `_` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `_` would be 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (since the loop runs until `_` is greater than `n`).

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is 3, `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the previous value of `a + b`**
