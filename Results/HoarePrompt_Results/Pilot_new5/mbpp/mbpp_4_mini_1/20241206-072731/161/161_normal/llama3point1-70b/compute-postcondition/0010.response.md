The code `a, b = b, a + b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. The previous values were `a` is 1, and `b` is 3. After executing the code, `a` will take the value of `b`, which is 3, and `b` will take the value of `a + b`, which is 1 + 3 = 4. The state of `n` is unchanged and remains greater than or equal to 3.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, loop variable is 3**
