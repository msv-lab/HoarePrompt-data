To analyze the impact of the code provided, we start with the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 2 (this condition remains valid).
- `_` is 3 (this remains unchanged).
- `a` is the previous value of `b`.
- `b` is the previous value of `a + b`.

Now, we execute the code:

```
a, b = b, a + b
```

This line of code performs simultaneous assignment. After execution:

1. The new value of `a` is assigned to the current value of `b`.
2. The new value of `b` is assigned to the current value of `a + b`.

Given that `a` is initially the previous value of `b`, let's denote:
- Let `b` be the previous value (let's say `b_prev`).
- Let `a` be the previous value of `a` (which we can refer to as `a_prev`).

After the execution:
- The new `a` becomes `b_prev`.
- The new `b` becomes `a_prev + b_prev`.

Thus, the values of `a` and `b` will change accordingly.

The output state after executing the code will be:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `_` is 3.
- `a` is the previous value of `b` (which is `b_prev`).
- `b` is the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b` (which is `a_prev + b_prev`).

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `_` is 3; `a` is the previous value of `b`; `b` is the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`, which is `a + b`.**
