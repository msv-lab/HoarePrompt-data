The code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. Since `list1` is a non-empty list, it will have at least one element. The last element of `list1` will be removed and replaced by the contents of `list2`. The state of `list1` will now be modified to include the elements from `list2`.

Thus, if `list1` had elements and `list2` is also a list, the new last element(s) of `list1` will now be the contents of `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` has been updated to replace its last element with the elements of `list2`, and `list2` remains unchanged.**
