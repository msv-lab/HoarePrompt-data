#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists. The first list (list1) must have at least one element to replace the last element.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1 :
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else :
        list1 = list2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are both lists. If `list1` is not empty, then the last element of `list1` is replaced with the elements of `list2`, and `list2` remains unchanged. If `list1` is empty, it is the same as `list2`, which is a list.
    return list1
    #The program returns list1, which has its last element replaced with the elements of list2 if list1 is not empty, or it's the same as list2 if list1 is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`. If `list1` is not empty, the last element of `list1` is replaced with the entire `list2`. If `list1` is empty, the function does not modify it (as list1 being assigned list2 does not change the original list1) and returns an empty list. The function returns a modified `list1` if it was not empty, or an empty list if `list1` was empty.
