Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. According to the problem description, the last element of the first list should be replaced by the entire second list. However, the program only removes the last element of the first list and appends the second list.

For example, consider the input:
```python
func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 4])
```
The expected output would be `[1, 3, 2, 4]`, but the program will return `[1, 3] + [2, 4]` which results in `[1, 3, 2, 4]` only if `[1, 3, 5]` was ignored, which is incorrect. The last element (5) is not being replaced but rather ignored. 

Thus, the code does not fulfill the requirement to replace the last element properly.
