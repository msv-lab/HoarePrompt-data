Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. Since it uses the indexing `s[-1]`, it will successfully access the last character of each string, regardless of the string's length. The program handles various cases, including empty strings or single-character strings:

1. For a tuple with strings such as `("hello", "world")`, the output will be `['o', 'd']`.
2. For a tuple that includes an empty string, like `("hello", "", "world")`, the output will be `['o', '', 'd']`, which is also correct as it returns the last character (or none if the string is empty).

Therefore, the function behaves as expected for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
