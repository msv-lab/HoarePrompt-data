Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings and correctly extracts the last character from each string using a list comprehension. The provided assertions confirm that the function works for the given examples. Additionally, the program handles various string lengths appropriately, as it does not assume all strings in the tuple are the same length and will return the last character for any provided string, even if it's a single-character string. There are no edge cases or potential failures identified in the problem description or the provided examples, thus confirming the correctness of the implementation.
