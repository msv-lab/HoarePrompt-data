Correctness: **True**

The program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The implementation uses a list comprehension, which iterates through each string in the tuple and retrieves the last character using indexing (`s[-1]`). 

The provided assertions confirm the expected behavior with multiple test cases, and there are no edge cases regarding empty strings or empty tuples that affect the correctness of the function. The function will correctly handle non-empty strings, and if an empty string were present in the tuple, it would raise an `IndexError`. However, since the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases, the program can be considered correct based on the provided examples.

Overall, the function works as intended for the described use cases, so the conclusion is that it is correct.
