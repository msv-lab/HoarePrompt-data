Correctness: **False**

The program does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function must extract the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the given tuple. However, the implementation of the function raises an IndexError if any string in the tuple is empty. This behavior means that the function fails to meet the requirements when the input tuple contains any empty strings.

For example, if the input tuple is `('', 'test', 'example')`, the program would raise an IndexError due to the first string being empty. Since the problem description does not specify how to handle empty strings, the function should ideally handle these cases gracefully without raising an error.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not account for all possible inputs as required by the problem description.
