Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly filters the dictionary entries based on the specified integer `n`. For every key-value pair in the dictionary `d`, it checks if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the pair is included in the returned dictionary. 

This implementation handles various cases properly:
1. If the dictionary is empty, it returns an empty dictionary.
2. If all values are less than `n`, it returns an empty dictionary.
3. If all values are greater than or equal to `n`, it returns the original dictionary.
4. If there are mixed values, it correctly retains only those entries that satisfy the condition.

Since the code fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all possible scenarios, it is correct.
