To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1` and the problem description, which requires checking if an expression is balanced with respect to brackets.

### Program Analysis
1. **Data Structure**: The program uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets.
2. **Matching Pairs**: It has a dictionary defining the matching pairs for the brackets.
3. **Logic**:
   - It iterates through each character in the input expression.
   - If the character is an opening bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, `'['`), it pushes it onto the stack.
   - If it encounters a closing bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, `']'`), it checks:
     - If the stack is empty (indicating no opening bracket available to match), it returns `False`.
     - If the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, it returns `False`.
   - Finally, it checks if the stack is empty. An empty stack means all opening brackets were matched properly; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Edge Cases Considered
- The function handles empty strings (returns `True`).
- It correctly identifies unbalanced expressions with mismatched brackets.
- It properly handles nested and sequential brackets.

### Potential Case
To check for correctness, let's consider the following input case:
- An expression with only closing brackets, e.g., `'))'`. The expected result is `False`, as there are no opening brackets to balance the closing brackets. 

### Check with the Function
- For the input `'))'`:
  - The stack remains empty, and when it encounters `')'`, it will trigger the condition that checks if the stack is empty and will return `False`, which is correct.

### Conclusion
After thorough examination, I haven't found a case where the function fails to meet the problem description. The logic correctly accounts for all balanced and unbalanced scenarios involving parentheses, braces, and brackets.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it accurately checks for balanced brackets in all tested scenarios, including various edge cases.
