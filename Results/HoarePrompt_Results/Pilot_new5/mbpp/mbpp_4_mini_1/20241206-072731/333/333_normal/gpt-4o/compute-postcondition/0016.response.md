Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in the string, and `stack` is empty. If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the function returns False if `stack` is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding character in `matching_pairs[char]`. Otherwise, the function continues execution without returning a value.***
