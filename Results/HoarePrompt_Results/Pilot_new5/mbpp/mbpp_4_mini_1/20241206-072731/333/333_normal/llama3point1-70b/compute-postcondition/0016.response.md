Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with at least one more character. If `char` is in `brackets.values()`, then if the stack is empty or the character popped from the stack does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping, the function returns False. If the stack is not empty and the popped character matches `char`, the function proceeds without any action taken.***
