The variable `char` is appended to the `stack` list. Since `char` is the first character in the non-empty `expression` and is one of the characters in the set of brackets, the `stack` will now contain this `char`. The `expression` remains unchanged, and `stack` transitions from being empty to containing one element.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a list containing `char`, `char` is the first character in the expression and one of the characters in the set of brackets.**
