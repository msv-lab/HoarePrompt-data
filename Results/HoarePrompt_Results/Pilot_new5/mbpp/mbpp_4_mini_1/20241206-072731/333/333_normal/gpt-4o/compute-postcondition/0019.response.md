The code snippet `stack.append(char)` adds the current character `char` to the `stack`. The initial state indicates that `expr` is a non-empty string with characters, and `char` is the next character to be processed from `expr`. Since `stack` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list or a valid stack structure prior to this operation.

The operation impacts the `stack` variable by adding `char` to it, but leaves `expr` and `char` unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of `stack` after the character has been appended.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of characters, `char` is the next character in the string after the current one, `stack` now contains `char` appended to it.**
