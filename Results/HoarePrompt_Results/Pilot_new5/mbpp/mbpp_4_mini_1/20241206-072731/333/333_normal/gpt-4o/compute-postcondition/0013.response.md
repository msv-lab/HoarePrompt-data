The code `stack.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the list `stack`. The initial state indicates that `expr` is a string with at least one character, `char` is that next character, and `stack` is initially empty. After executing the code, `stack` will now contain one element, which is the value of `char`.

Output State: **`expr` is a string consisting of characters that has at least 1 character, `char` is the next character in the string, `stack` contains `char`.**
