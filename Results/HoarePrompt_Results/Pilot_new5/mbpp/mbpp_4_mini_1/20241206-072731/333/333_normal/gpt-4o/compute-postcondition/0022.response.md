Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of characters, `char` is the next character in the string after the current one. If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, and if `stack` is empty or the popped element from `stack` does not match `matching_pairs[char]`, the function returns False, indicating a condition that is not met within the context of the execution.***
