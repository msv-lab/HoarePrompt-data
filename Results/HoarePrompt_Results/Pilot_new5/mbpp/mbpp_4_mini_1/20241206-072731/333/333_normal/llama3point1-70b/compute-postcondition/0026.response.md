The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expression`. `expression` is a string that may contain various characters, including parentheses, brackets, and braces. After executing the function body, the following outcomes are possible: 

- Case 1: The function returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced with respect to brackets.
- Case 2: The function returns `False`.
- Case 3: The function returns `False`, indicating a boolean value that signifies the negation of a condition or outcome.
- Case 4: The function returns `True` if all brackets in `expression` are matched and closed properly; otherwise, it returns `False` if there are unmatched opening brackets.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `expression` and evaluate the balance of brackets within it, returning true or false based on whether the brackets are properly matched and closed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter expression (a string), returns False for unbalanced expressions or certain conditions, and returns True if all brackets in expression are matched and closed properly.**
