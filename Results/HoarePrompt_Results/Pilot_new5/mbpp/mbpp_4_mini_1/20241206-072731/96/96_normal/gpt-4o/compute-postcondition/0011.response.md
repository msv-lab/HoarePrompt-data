According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the tuple `tup`. Since `tup` is a non-empty tuple with at least 2 elements, and `element` is currently referencing the first element in the tuple, for the loop to execute one more time, `element` must reference the next element in `tup`.

At the end of the last iteration, `element` is the current element being processed in the loop. If `tup` has at least 2 elements, then the loop has processed one element, and for it to execute one more time, it must move to the next element. 

Therefore, if there are at least 2 elements in `tup`, after processing the first element, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element to process.

State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element in the tuple.**
