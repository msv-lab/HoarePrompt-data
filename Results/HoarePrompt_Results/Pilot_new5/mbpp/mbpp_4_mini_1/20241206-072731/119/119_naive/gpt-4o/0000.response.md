Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The assertions provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. There are no edge cases or additional inputs that would lead to incorrect behavior since the function's logic directly aligns with the requirementsâ€”rearranging the two input parameters into a tuple in the specified order. Since all potential cases lead to the expected output, the program is correct.
