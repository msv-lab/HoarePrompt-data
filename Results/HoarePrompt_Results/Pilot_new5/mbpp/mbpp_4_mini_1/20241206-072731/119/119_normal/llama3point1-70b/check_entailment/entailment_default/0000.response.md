The program provided takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. 

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)
```
The code simply returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which matches the requirement stated in the problem description: "returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number."

Now, let's assess any potential edge cases. The problem description does not specify any constraints on the types of inputs, so it can be inferred that both integers and floats are acceptable. Since the function returns a tuple with the values in the specified order, it should work correctly for any numeric inputs (including negative numbers and floats).

The output hints state that the function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be either integers or floats, and confirms that it returns them in the specified order without issues related to input types.

I cannot find any edge case where the code does not meet the problem description. The function correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly takes two numbers as inputs and returns them in the tuple in the order specified by the problem description, without any edge cases or issues arising from the input types.
