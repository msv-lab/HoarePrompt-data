#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a, where a and b are numbers (integers or floats)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be either integers or floats, and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that order. There are no potential edge cases related to input types since the function will return the values regardless of whether they are integers or floats.
