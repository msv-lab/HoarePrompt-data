#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are any two values.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a in that order, where a and b are any two values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that order. There are no edge cases to consider since it simply returns the inputs without any conditions or modifications.
