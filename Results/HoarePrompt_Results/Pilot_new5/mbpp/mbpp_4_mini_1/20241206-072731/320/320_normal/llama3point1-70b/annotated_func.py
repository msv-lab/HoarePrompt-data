#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, as there are less than 2 unique integers in `unique_nums`, which is derived from the list `nums` containing at least two distinct elements.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`. The length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums`, and it returns the second smallest unique integer from the list. If there are fewer than two unique integers after removing duplicates, the function returns None. The code assumes there are at least two distinct elements initially, as stated in the precondition, but does not explicitly handle cases where `nums` might still result in fewer than two unique elements after conversion to a set.
