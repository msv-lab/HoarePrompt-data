`unique_nums` is assigned the value of a list created from the set of `nums`, which removes any duplicate elements. Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` will contain all unique elements from `nums`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`.**
