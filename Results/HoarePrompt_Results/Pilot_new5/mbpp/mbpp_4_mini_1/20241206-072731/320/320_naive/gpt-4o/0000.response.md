Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. It first converts the input list `nums` into a set to remove duplicates, then sorts the unique numbers. If there are more than one unique numbers, it returns the second smallest (i.e., the element at index 1). If there is only one unique number or the list is empty, it returns `None`. 

The provided assertions confirm the functionality for various scenarios, including cases where the list has duplicates and where the second smallest number is negative. All examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the function.
