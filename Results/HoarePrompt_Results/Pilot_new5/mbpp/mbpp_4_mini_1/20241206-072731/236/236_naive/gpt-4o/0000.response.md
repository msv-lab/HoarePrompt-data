To analyze the program provided against the problem description, we need to check if the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a specified list is sorted or not.

### Review of the Program:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis of the Function:

1. The function iterates through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element (i.e., `len(lst) - 1`).
2. For each element, it compares it with the next element.
3. If it finds any element that is greater than the next one, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

### Consideration of Edge Cases:
- An empty list: The function will return `True` because there are no elements to violate the sorted property.
- A single-element list: The function will also return `True` because a list with one element is trivially sorted.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function correctly handles this as well, since equal elements do not violate the sorted order.

### Test Cases Provided:
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True` (correct).
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False` (correct).
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The function correctly identifies sorted lists and handles edge cases appropriately. There are no identified cases where the function fails to meet the specified requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
