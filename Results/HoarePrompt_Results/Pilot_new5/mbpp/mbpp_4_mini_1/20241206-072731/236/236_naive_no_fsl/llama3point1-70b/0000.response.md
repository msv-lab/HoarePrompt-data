Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` checks whether the input list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. If the two lists are identical, it means the original list is sorted. 

This approach works correctly for all potential cases, including:
1. An empty list `[]` - which is considered sorted.
2. A list with one element `[1]` - which is also sorted by definition.
3. A sorted list in ascending order, such as `[1, 2, 3]`.
4. A sorted list in descending order `[3, 2, 1]` - would return `False` since it is not sorted in ascending order.
5. A list with duplicate values, such as `[1, 1, 1]` - which is sorted.

Since the function reliably checks for all these cases and returns the correct boolean value, it meets the problem requirements completely.
