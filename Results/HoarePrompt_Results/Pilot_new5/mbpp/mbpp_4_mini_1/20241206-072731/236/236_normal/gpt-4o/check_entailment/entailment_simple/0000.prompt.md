You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be of any type that supports comparison.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements in non-decreasing order, `i` is the index of the last element checked before the end of the loop, and the function returns True. If `lst` has 0 or 1 elements, the function returns True and `i` is undefined.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list 'lst' is either empty, has one element, or has been verified to be in non-decreasing order. The index 'i' is undefined in these cases.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
