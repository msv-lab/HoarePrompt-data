The provided program defines a function `func_1` that checks if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If any element is found to be greater than the next element, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding any such case, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

### Analysis:
1. **Correctness of the comparison:** The comparison `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]` correctly identifies if the list is not sorted, as it checks if the current element is greater than the next element.
2. **Return values:** The function returns `True` for:
   - An empty list
   - A list with one element (both cases are trivially sorted)
   - A completely sorted list (where all elements satisfy the non-decreasing condition).
3. **Edge cases:** The function properly handles edge cases, such as:
   - An empty list will pass the loop condition and return `True`.
   - A single-element list will also return `True`, as there are no comparisons to make.

### Test Cases:
The three provided assertions test the function against both sorted and unsorted lists and cover various scenarios:
- The first assertion checks a sorted list and expects `True`.
- The second assertion checks an unsorted list and expects `False`.
- The third assertion checks another unsorted list and expects `False`.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order, fulfilling the requirements outlined in the problem description. There are no identified cases where the function would fail to deliver the expected outcome based on the provided conditions.

Correctness: **True**
