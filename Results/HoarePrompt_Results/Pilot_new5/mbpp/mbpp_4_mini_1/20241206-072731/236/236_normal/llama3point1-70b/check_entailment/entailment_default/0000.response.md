The provided Python function checks if a specified list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of the list. The function returns `True` if the list is in non-decreasing order and `False` otherwise.

Looking at the problem description, it states that the function should determine if a list is sorted. The function `func_1` indeed checks if the list `nums` is equal to its sorted version, which aligns with the requirement to check if the list is sorted.

Now, letâ€™s consider potential edge cases. According to the problem description, an empty list is inherently sorted, as it has no elements to compare. Additionally, a single-element list is also considered sorted since there are no other elements to compare against. 

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of comparable elements `nums` and returns `True` for an empty or a single-element list. This agrees with how the function `func_1` would react to those cases, as both would return `True` due to the equality check with their sorted forms.

Therefore, the function appears to correctly identify ordered lists and returns appropriate boolean values for various cases, including empty and single-element lists. Since the function correctly handles all potential cases as described, it satisfies the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function accurately checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. It properly accounts for edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists, both of which are sorted by definition. Thus, it follows the problem description correctly for all potential cases.
