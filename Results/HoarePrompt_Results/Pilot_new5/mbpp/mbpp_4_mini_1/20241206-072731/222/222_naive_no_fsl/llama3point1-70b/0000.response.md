Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem requires a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string, but the implementation only retains uppercase characters and ignores the removal of lowercase substrings entirely.

For example, consider the input string `"HelloWorld"`. The expected behavior according to the problem description would be to return an empty string since all lowercase letters should be removed. However, the program would return `"HW"` instead, which indicates that it is not functioning as required.

Additionally, for an input string like `"abcXYZdef"`, the expected output should be `"XYZ"` (removing all lowercase substrings), but the program would again return `"XYZ"` which is partially correct only for uppercase letters but does not fulfill the requirement to remove all lowercase substrings.

Thus, the program does not work as expected in all cases.
