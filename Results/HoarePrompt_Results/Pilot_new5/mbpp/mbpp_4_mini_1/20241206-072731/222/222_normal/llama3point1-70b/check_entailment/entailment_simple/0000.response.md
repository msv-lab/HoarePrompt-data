Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it removes lowercase substrings from the input string. Instead, it only retains uppercase characters, effectively failing to address the requirement of removing lowercase substrings entirely. 

For example, if the input string is `"HelloWorld"`, the program would return `"HW"`, which does not fulfill the task of removing lowercase substrings like `"ello"` and `"orld"`. 

The correct implementation should involve identifying and removing any sequence of lowercase letters from the original string, rather than simply filtering for uppercase characters. This discrepancy demonstrates that the program does not fulfill the given problem description.
