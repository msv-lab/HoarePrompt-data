The variable `result` is updated by appending `char` to its current value. The initial state specifies that `result` is either equal to `char` if it is uppercase or remains an empty string. So, if `char` is uppercase, `result` will contain the value of `char` again (resulting in `result` being equal to `char + char`), while if `char` is not uppercase, `result` will remain as an empty string (resulting in `result` being still an empty string). 

Therefore, the Output State retains all the information about the preconditions while updating the value of `result` accordingly based on whether `char` is uppercase or not.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the second character of `s`; `result` is either equal to `char + char` if `char` is uppercase or remains an empty string if `char` is not uppercase.**
