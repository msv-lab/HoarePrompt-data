Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but instead, it only collects and returns uppercase characters from the input string `s`. 

The key issue is that the program fails to remove lowercase substrings; it does not address the requirement to remove any characters that are lowercase. Instead, it simply filters the string to retain only uppercase characters.

For example, if the input string `s` is `"Hello World"`, the expected behavior according to the problem description would be to return ` "H W"` (removing any lowercase characters), but the current implementation would return `"HW"`, which is not in line with removing lowercase substrings, as it still contains uppercase characters but does not fulfill the stated requirement of "removing" lowercase substrings.

Therefore, the program incorrectly interprets the task and does not implement the removal of lowercase substrings as specified in the problem description.
