Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements a function that finds even numbers from a list of numbers. 

1. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `numbers` and checks if the number is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`.
2. It returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.
3. The assertions provided test the function with several inputs, and all assert that the function behaves as expected.

The program handles typical cases, including:
- A list with mixed odd and even numbers.
- A list that includes zero (which is even).
- A list consisting only of even numbers.

Since I cannot identify any edge cases or incorrect behavior based on the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
