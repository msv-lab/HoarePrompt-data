The provided program is designed to find even numbers from a list of integers. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `numbers` and includes only those numbers that are even (i.e., that satisfy `num % 2 == 0`).

### Initial Assessment:
The problem description states that the function should return a new list containing all even integers from the provided input list. Based on the code:
- It correctly identifies and returns even numbers from the list.
- The use of list comprehension is efficient and clear.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: The function should handle an empty list correctly, returning an empty list.
2. **Non-integer Elements**: The output hints suggest that the function does not handle cases where the input list may contain non-integer elements. The program will simply exclude those elements if they are present, which means it does not raise an error but doesn't handle them explicitly either.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list with all even integers. It also mentions that non-integer elements will be excluded silently. This aligns with the programâ€™s behavior, as the list comprehension will not include non-integer elements in the output list.

### Conclusion:
The function seems to work fine for the given examples and is likely correct for most typical cases. However, it does not explicitly handle or notify about non-integer elements in the list, which could be considered a limitation.

Given that the code does not explicitly handle all potential edge cases, particularly with non-integer elements, I conclude that:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case, particularly for lists containing non-integer elements or when additional behavior related to handling such cases is required.
