Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." However, the implementation of the function `func_1` uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) on the elements of the tuples. 

This means that instead of extracting elements elementwise (which could imply simply creating a new tuple with the corresponding elements), the function is performing a bitwise operation, which is not what is described in the problem statement. 

For example, if we take the first test case:

```python
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
```

This returns a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples. However, the expected outcome according to the problem description does not specify any operation beyond simply combining the tuples elementwise.

Thus, the function does not adhere to the original problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
