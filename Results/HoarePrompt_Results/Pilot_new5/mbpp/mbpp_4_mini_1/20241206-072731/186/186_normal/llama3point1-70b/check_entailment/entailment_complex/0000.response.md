Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description states that the function must "extract the elementwise and tuples" from the given two tuples. However, the program implements a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples.

The issue arises because the term "elementwise and" is ambiguous without clarification. The expected behavior from the problem description would be to simply return a new tuple that contains the corresponding elements from both `tup1` and `tup2`, rather than performing a bitwise operation. 

For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`, the correct behavior per the problem description would be to return `((1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6))`, which is not what the provided function does. Instead, the function would return `(0, 0, 0)`, which is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on these pairs.

Thus, the function does not satisfy the requirements as outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is incorrect.
