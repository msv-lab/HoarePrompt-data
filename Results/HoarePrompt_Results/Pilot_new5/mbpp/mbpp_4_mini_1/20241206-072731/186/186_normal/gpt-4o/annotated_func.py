#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a new tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from both tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will only compute the bitwise AND for the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, potentially ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.
