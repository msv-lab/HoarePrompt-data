Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input string contains a word that has a 'z' at the beginning or end, which should not be counted according to the problem description. For example, the input "zebra is a word" will return `True`, which is incorrect because the 'z' is at the start of the word "zebra". Another example, "word z", should also return `False`, but the program will return `True` since it checks only if 'z' is present in the middle of words.

Thus, the program fails to correctly verify the presence of 'z' only in the allowed positions, leading to incorrect outcomes in those scenarios.
