Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. For example, the input string `'zabc'` should return `False` because 'z' is at the start of the word. However, the function does not explicitly check for this condition. The code only checks if 'z' exists between the first and last characters, but it does not account for cases where 'z' appears at the start or the end of the string. 

Another potential issue is with strings that are less than 3 characters long. For example, the input `'az'` should return `False` (because 'z' is at the end), but the current implementation would incorrectly return `False` since there are not enough characters to check.

These examples indicate that there are potential cases where the function does not behave as expected.
