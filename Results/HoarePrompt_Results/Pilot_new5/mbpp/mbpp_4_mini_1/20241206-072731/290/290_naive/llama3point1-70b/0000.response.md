Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if a given string contains the character 'z' in any of the words, but not at the start or end of those words. It splits the input string into words and checks each word that has more than one character. Within those words, it only checks the substring excluding the first and last characters (i.e., `word[1:-1]`). If 'z' is found within that substring, the function returns `True`. If no such occurrence is found in any word, it returns `False`.

Given the problem description, the program handles all potential cases accurately:
1. It correctly ignores single-character words.
2. It checks for 'z' only when present in the middle of the words, as required.

No counterexamples can be devised against the described functionality, confirming that the program meets the requirements.
