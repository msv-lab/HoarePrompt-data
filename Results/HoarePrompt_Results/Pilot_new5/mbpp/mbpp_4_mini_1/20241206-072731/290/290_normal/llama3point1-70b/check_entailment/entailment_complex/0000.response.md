Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(s)` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The function is required to check if any word in a given string `s` contains the letter 'z', but only if 'z' is not located at the start or the end of the word.

2. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function first splits the string `s` into words using `s.split()`.
   - It then iterates over each word in the list `words`.
   - For each word, it checks two conditions:
     - The word's length is greater than 1 (`len(word) > 1`), ensuring that there are characters between the first and last characters to check.
     - The letter 'z' is present in the substring that excludes the first and last character (`'z' in word[1:-1]`).

3. **Return Values**: 
   - If any word meets both conditions, the function returns `True` immediately.
   - If no such words are found after checking all the words, it returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The function correctly handles cases where the string may have only one character, as it will not raise an error due to the length check.
   - It also efficiently processes multiple words in the string, returning as soon as a valid condition is met, which is optimal.

5. **Conclusion**: Since the function correctly identifies the presence of 'z' in words, while ensuring it is not at the start or end, and adheres to the constraints given in the problem description, it is accurate in its implementation.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**.
