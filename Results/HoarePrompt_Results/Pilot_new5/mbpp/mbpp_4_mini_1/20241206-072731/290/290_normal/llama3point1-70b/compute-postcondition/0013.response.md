The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string with at least one character. After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on various cases: 

- Case 1: If the length of `s` is greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in its internal characters, the function returns `True`.
- Case 2: The function returns `True` if certain unspecified conditions related to the string `s` and a list `words` are satisfied.
- Case 3: The function returns `True` under unspecified conditions in this case.
- Case 4: If there are no words with length greater than 1 that contain the letter 'z' in the substring excluding the first and last character, the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return `True` or `False` based on the specified conditions involving the presence of the character 'z' and other unspecified criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, a string, and returns `True` if the length of `s` is greater than 1 and contains 'z', satisfies certain conditions related to `s` and `words`, or meets unspecified conditions. It returns `False` if there are no words with length greater than 1 that contain 'z' in the substring excluding the first and last character.**
