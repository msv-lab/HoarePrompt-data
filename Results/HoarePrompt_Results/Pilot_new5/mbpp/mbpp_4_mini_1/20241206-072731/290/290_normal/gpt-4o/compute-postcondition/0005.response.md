Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` with a length of at least 1 and returns `True` if the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z'; otherwise, it returns `False`. If `s` has a length of 1 or 2, the substring will be empty, and thus the function will return `False`. **
