Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with at least one character, `words` is a list containing at least three words, and `word` is the third word in the list. If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and the character 'z' is found within the substring of `word` from the second to the second-to-last character, the program returns True. Otherwise, there is no return value.***
