#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numeric values (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of total_sum, which is the sum of the rounded values in rounded_numbers, and len(numbers), the length of the list of numeric values in numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numeric values (either integers or floats), rounds each value in the list, calculates the sum of these rounded values, and returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty, which would lead to a multiplication by zero, resulting in a return value of zero.
