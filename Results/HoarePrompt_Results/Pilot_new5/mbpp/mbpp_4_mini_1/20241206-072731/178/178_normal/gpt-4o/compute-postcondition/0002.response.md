The value of `result` is assigned the value of `total_sum` multiplied by the length of the `numbers` list. The value of `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`, and `len(numbers)` gives the count of the elements in the `numbers` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded values of each element in `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`, `result` is equal to `total_sum * len(numbers)`**.
