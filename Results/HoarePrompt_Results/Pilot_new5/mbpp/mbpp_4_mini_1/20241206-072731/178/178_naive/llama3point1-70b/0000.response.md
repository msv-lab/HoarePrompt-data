Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for the situation when the input list is empty. In such a case, the `len(numbers)` would be 0, leading to a multiplication by zero, which results in an output of 0. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, which could lead to ambiguity in the expected behavior. A more robust implementation should ideally handle edge cases like empty lists or provide clarification in the problem description regarding such scenarios.
