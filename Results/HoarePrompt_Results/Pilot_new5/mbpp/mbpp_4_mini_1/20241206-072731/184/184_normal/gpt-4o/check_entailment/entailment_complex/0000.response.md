Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. The function `func_1` takes a list `nums` as input and returns a new list that contains only the odd integers from `nums`. 

Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list of integers (`nums`), as specified in the problem description.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The list comprehension within the function iterates through each integer in `nums` and checks if it is odd using the condition `num % 2 != 0`. If the condition is true, it includes the number in the resultant list.

3. **Correct Outputs**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases to verify the function's correctness. Each assertion checks that the output of `func_1` matches the expected list of odd numbers for various input lists.

4. **Behavior with Empty Input**: The function correctly returns an empty list if `nums` is empty, which is appropriate behavior according to the specification.

Since every requirement from the problem description is fulfilled by the implementation of `func_1`, we conclude that the program is correct.
