Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to filter out odd numbers from a list of integers. 

Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a single argument, `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers.

2. **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and applies the condition `num % 2 != 0`. This condition checks if the number is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2).

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list containing only the numbers that satisfy the condition of being odd.

4. **Testing**: The assertions given in the annotated program demonstrate that the function returns the expected list of odd numbers for various input cases. Each assertion is a test case that checks if the function's output matches the expected result.

Since the function effectively filters out all odd numbers from any list of integers as specified in the problem description, it consistently adheres to the stated requirements. Thus, it is correct.
