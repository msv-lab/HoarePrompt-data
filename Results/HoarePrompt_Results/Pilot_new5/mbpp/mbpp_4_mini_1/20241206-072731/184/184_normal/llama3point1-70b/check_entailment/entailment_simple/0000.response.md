Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement of filtering odd numbers from a list of integers. The function `func_1` takes a list `nums` as input and uses a list comprehension to create and return a new list that includes only those integers from `nums` that are not divisible by 2 (i.e., odd integers).

The condition `num % 2 != 0` effectively checks for odd numbers, and the list comprehension iterates over all elements in the `nums` list, ensuring that every integer is evaluated. As a result, the output will contain only the odd integers, matching the specification provided in the problem description. 

Thus, the program consistently adheres to the requirements stated in the problem description.
