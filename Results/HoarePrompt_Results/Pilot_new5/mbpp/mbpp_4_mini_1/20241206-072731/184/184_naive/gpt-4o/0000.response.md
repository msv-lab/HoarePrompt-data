Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements a function to filter odd numbers from a list. The comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` accurately checks each number in the list and includes it in the result if it is odd (i.e., if the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero). 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works as expected for various input lists, returning only the odd numbers. Since all potential cases considered return the expected results, the program meets the problem description requirements effectively.
