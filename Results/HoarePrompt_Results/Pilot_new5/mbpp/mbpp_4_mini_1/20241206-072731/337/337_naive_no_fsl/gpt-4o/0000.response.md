To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

### Analysis:
1. The current implementation uses `set(lst)` to convert the list into a set, which inherently removes any duplicate values.
2. The `sum()` function then calculates the total of the unique values present in the set.

### Evaluation:
The key point in the problem description is to find the sum of **non-repeated elements** specifically. The current implementation does not meet this requirement because it sums all unique elements, not just those that appear exactly once in the original list.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`:
- The non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which sum to `20`.
- However, the function will return `21` because it sums all unique elements (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`).

Thus, the function fails to correctly compute the sum of non-repeated elements as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The implementation does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
