Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(lst)` is designed to find the sum of non-repeated elements (i.e., elements that appear exactly once) in the list `lst`.

2. **Logic**: The program uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function. The expression `i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1` iterates over each element `i` in the list `lst`, checking if its count in the list is exactly one (`lst.count(i) == 1`). This means it only includes those elements that are non-repeated.

3. **Return Value**: When the sum is computed, if there are no non-repeated elements, the sum will be zero (since the sum of an empty iterable is zero), which is consistent with the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the edge case of an empty list. If `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, aligning with the expectation that the sum of non-repeated elements in an empty list is also zero.

In conclusion, the program adheres strictly to the problem description by correctly identifying non-repeated elements and summing them up, resulting in a correct implementation for all scenarios described.
