Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirement to remove characters with odd index values from a string. The function `func_1` constructs a new string by including only the characters at even indices (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, etc.). 

The test cases provided:
1. `func_1('abcdef')` returns `'ace'`, which correctly removes characters at indices 1, 3, and 5.
2. `func_1('python')` returns `'pto'`, which correctly refers to characters at indices 0, 2, and 4.
3. `func_1('data')` returns `'dt'`, correctly removing characters at indices 1 and 3.
4. `func_1('lambs')` returns `'lms'`, correctly omitting characters at indices 1 and 3.

Since the function behaves correctly for all tested cases, and I cannot think of any additional edge cases where it would fail, the program is correct as per the problem description.
