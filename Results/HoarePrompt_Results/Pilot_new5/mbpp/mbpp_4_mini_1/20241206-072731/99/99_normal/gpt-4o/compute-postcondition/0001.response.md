The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of any characters. After executing the function body, it returns a string formed by concatenating characters from the original string `s` at even indices. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return a new string created from the characters located at even indices of `s`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, returns a string formed by concatenating characters from s at even indices.**
