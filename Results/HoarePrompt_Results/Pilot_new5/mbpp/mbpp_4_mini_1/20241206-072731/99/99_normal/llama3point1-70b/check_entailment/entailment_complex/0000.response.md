Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The task specifies that characters with odd index values should be removed from the given string, which means that characters at indices 1, 3, 5, etc., should not appear in the output.

However, the function `func_1` is designed to return a new string formed by concatenating characters at even index values (0, 2, 4, etc.). This means the characters at odd indices are actually retained in the output, contrary to what the problem description requires.

For example:
- If the input string is "abcdef", the characters at odd indices (1, 3) are 'b' and 'd'. The program will return "ace" (characters at even indices), which does not fulfill the requirement of removing the characters at odd indices.

Thus, the program does not implement the specified functionality as described in the problem statement.
