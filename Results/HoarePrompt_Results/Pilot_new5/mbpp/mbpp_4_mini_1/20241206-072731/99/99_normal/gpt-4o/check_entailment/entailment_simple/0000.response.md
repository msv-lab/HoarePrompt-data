To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirement and the program implementation.

**Problem Description:** The function must remove the characters that have odd index values from a given string. 

This means that we want to keep the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and remove those at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).

**Annotated Program Analysis:**

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
```

In this program:

1. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as an argument.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string.
3. It checks if the index `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`).
4. For even indices, it adds the corresponding character `s[i]` to the list.
5. Finally, it joins the list into a new string and returns it.

The functionality as described in the program aligns with the problem description. The program is tasked with removing characters at odd indices by only including characters at even indices in the result.

**Test Cases:**
- For the input `'abcdef'`, the characters at even indices are `'a'`, `'c'`, and `'e'`, resulting in `'ace'`.
- For the input `'python'`, the characters at even indices are `'p'`, `'t'`, and `'o'`, resulting in `'pto'`.
- For the input `'data'`, the characters at even indices are `'d'` and `'t'`, resulting in `'dt'`.
- For the input `'lambs'`, the characters at even indices are `'l'`, `'m'`, and `'s'`, resulting in `'lms'`.

Every test case confirms that the function behaves as required by the problem description.

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
