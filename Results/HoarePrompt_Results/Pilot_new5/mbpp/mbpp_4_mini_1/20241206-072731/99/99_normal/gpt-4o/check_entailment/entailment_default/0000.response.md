Examining the provided program and the problem description, the task is to remove characters from a string that have odd index values, which means keeping only characters at even indices.

The code provided is:
```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string `s` and includes only those characters where the index `i` is even. This directly aligns with the problem description. 

The examples provided in the assertions confirm that:
- For the input `'abcdef'`, the function returns `'ace'` (indices 0, 2, 4).
- For the input `'python'`, it returns `'pto'` (indices 0, 2, 4).
- For the input `'data'`, it returns `'dt'` (indices 0, 2).
- For the input `'lambs'`, it returns `'lms'` (indices 0, 2, 4).

In terms of edge cases, the output hints note that if the input string is empty, the function should return an empty string, which it does, as the range would be from 0 to 0, resulting in no indices to process.

Next, regarding the output hints: they state that the function handles any character in the string, including special characters and spaces. This is also supported by the code since it does not impose any restrictions on the characters in the string `s`.

After considering the problem description, code logic, and output hints, there are no identified cases where the code fails to meet the requirements.

Thus, the function performs correctly for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
