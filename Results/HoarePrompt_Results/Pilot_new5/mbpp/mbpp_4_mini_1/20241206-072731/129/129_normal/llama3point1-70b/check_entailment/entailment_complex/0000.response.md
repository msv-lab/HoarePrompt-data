Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description. While it does implement the function to return the ASCII value of a given character string using the `ord` function, it lacks input validation. The annotations state that the function assumes the input is always a valid single character string, which is not guaranteed in practice. 

For example, if the function is called with an empty string or a multi-character string, it could raise an error (TypeError or ValueError). Since the problem description does not specify that the input will always be valid, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not handle all scenarios as required by the problem description.
