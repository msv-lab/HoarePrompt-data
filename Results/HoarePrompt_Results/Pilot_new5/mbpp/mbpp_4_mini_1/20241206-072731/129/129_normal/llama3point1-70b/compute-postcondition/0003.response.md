Functionality: ** The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns the ASCII value of that character as an integer. There are no checks for the validity of the input, so if `char` is not a single character string, it may raise a TypeError or ValueError. Therefore, the function assumes the input is always a valid single character string. **
