Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input string `char` is not exactly one character long. According to the problem description, the function should return the ASCII value of a "single character." However, if the input string has more than one character or is empty, the function will still attempt to call `ord(char)`, which will lead to incorrect behavior or possibly raise an error.

For example:
- If `char` is an empty string (`""`), calling `ord("")` will raise a `TypeError` since `ord()` expects a single character.
- If `char` is a multi-character string (e.g., `"abc"`), calling `ord("abc")` will also raise a `TypeError`.

Thus, the function does not satisfy all potential cases as specified in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
