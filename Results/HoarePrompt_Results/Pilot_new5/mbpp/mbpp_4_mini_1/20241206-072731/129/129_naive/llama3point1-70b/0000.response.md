Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to return the ASCII value of a single character. The function `ord(char)` accurately retrieves the ASCII value for any valid single character input, including letters, digits, punctuation, and special characters.

The function has the following characteristics:
1. It accepts a string parameter `char` that is expected to be a single character.
2. It uses the `ord` built-in function, which is designed to return the ASCII (or Unicode) value of a given character.
3. As long as the input is a single character, it will return the correct ASCII value for that character.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail, assuming that the user adheres to the requirement of providing a single character. If the user inputs more than one character or a non-character (like an integer or a list), the function may raise an error, but this scenario isn't specified in the problem description. Thus, the implementation correctly fulfills the stated requirement for valid single character inputs.
