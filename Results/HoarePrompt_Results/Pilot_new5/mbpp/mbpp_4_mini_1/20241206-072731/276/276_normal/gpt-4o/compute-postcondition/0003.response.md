To determine the output state after running the provided code, let's analyze it step by step.

1. `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`. Since the length of `merged_list` is even, we can denote it as having size `2n` (because both `list1` and `list2` have size `n`).

2. The variable `mid` is assigned the value `n`. Hence, it represents the middle index of the `merged_list`, which is `n`.

3. The code computes the `median` as the average of the two middle elements in `merged_list`:
   - `merged_list[mid - 1]`, which corresponds to `merged_list[n - 1]`, and
   - `merged_list[mid]`, which corresponds to `merged_list[n]`.

4. The result of this sum `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2` assigns the computed average to the variable `median`.

The previous values of the affected variables are maintained, but we now know how `median` is calculated based on the elements located at indices `n - 1` and `n` of `merged_list`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers of size `n`, `list2` is a list of integers of size `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `mid` is `n`, and `median` is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.**
