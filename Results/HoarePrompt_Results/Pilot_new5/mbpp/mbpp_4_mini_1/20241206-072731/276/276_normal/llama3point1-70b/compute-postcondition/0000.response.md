The code merges `list1` and `list2` and assigns the result to `merged_list`, sorting the combined list of integers. Since `list1` and `list2` are both lists of integers of the same size, the merged result will also be a list of integers with size equal to the sum of the sizes of `list1` and `list2`. The previous states of `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`.**
