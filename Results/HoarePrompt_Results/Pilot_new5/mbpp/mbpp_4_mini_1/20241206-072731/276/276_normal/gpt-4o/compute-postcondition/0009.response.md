Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of the same size, and a positive integer `n` representing that size. It merges and sorts these lists, then calculates and returns the median of the combined sorted list. If `list1` and `list2` are empty or if `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not handle these edge cases properly, potentially leading to incorrect behavior. **
