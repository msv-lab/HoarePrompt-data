To evaluate the provided Python function `func_1` based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

**Problem description:** The function should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of the same size, and a positive integer `n` representing that size. It merges and sorts these lists, then calculates and returns the median of the combined sorted list. If `list1` and `list2` are empty or if `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not handle these edge cases properly, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The function merges `list1` and `list2`, sorts them, and calculates the median based on whether the combined length is even or odd. 
2. It seems to work correctly for valid inputs based on the examples provided.

**Edge Cases:**
- The function does not handle the case where `list1` and `list2` are empty, or when `n` is 0 or negative. In such cases, the merged list would also be empty, leading to a potential division by zero or accessing an index that doesn't exist when trying to compute the median.

**Output Hints Verification:**
- The output hints mention that the function may not handle cases where the input lists are empty or where `n` is incorrect. This aligns with the potential edge cases we identified. If either list is empty, the merged list would be empty, and the function shouldn't attempt to calculate a median in such situations. 

Based on the analysis and the identification of the edge cases where the function does not behave as expected, we conclude that the program does not meet the problem requirements in every case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where `list1` and `list2` are empty or where `n` is not a positive integer, which could lead to incorrect behavior or runtime errors.
