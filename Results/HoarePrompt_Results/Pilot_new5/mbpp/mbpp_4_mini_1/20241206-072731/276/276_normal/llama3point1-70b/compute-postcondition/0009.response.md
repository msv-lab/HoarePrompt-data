Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of integers `list1` and `list2`, along with a positive integer `size` that is equal to the length of both lists. It merges and sorts these lists to compute the median value. If the size is even, it averages the two middle numbers; if the size is odd, it returns the middle number. This function assumes that both input lists are of the same specified size, and does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or of different lengths. **
