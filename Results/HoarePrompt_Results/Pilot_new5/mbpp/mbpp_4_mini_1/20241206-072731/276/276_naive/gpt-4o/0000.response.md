Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the edge case where the two lists are of odd length. The problem description specifies that the function should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, but the implementation assumes that the merged list will always be of even size (as evidenced by how it calculates the median). 

For example, if we input two lists of size 3, such as `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]`, the merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, resulting in a median of `3.5`, which is correct. However, if we input two lists of size 1, such as `[1]` and `[2]`, the merged list would be `[1, 2]`, and the median would be `1.5`, which would be correct again. 

However, if the input lists are `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, the merged list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the median should be `2.5`, which the function correctly calculates. 

Yet, if you consider lists of equal odd sizes, the implementation logic fails to accommodate the proper calculation due to it being geared towards even lengths. For example, inputting two lists of size 5, like `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` and `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, leads to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, but the median calculation does not correctly reflect the odd-numbered scenario due to the flawed assumption of always producing an even length.

Thus, the implementation does not sufficiently handle cases where both lists are of odd length, leading to incorrect median calculations for such scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
