To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem description:** Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

The program creates `n` empty lists in `result` and iterates over each element in `lst`, appending each element to one of these sublists based on the index of the element modulo `n`. 

Now, let's consider a few edge cases:

1. **When `n` is greater than the length of `lst`:**
   - If `lst` is `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `n` is `5`, the output should logically return a list of 5 lists, where the first three are populated with the elements and the last two remain empty. The program will still work, returning `[ ['a'], ['b'], ['c'], [], [] ]`.

2. **When `n` is equal to 0:**
   - If `n` is `0`, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when it tries to create an empty list for each index `% n`. This is a critical edge case that is not handled in the code.

3. **When `lst` is empty:**
   - If `lst` is `[]` and `n` is `3`, the program will return `[[], [], []]`, which is a valid output.

4. **When `n` is 1:**
   - If `lst` is `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `n` is `1`, the program returns `[['a', 'b', 'c']]`, which is correct.

Based on the analysis, the program does not handle the case when `n` is `0`, as it will raise an error. Therefore, since there is at least one input case where the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
