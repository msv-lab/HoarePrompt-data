Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists based on the specified integer `n`. It creates `n` empty sublists and then iterates through the input list, appending each element to the appropriate sublist based on the index. 

Here is a breakdown of how the function operates:

1. It initializes a list of `n` empty lists: `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]`.
2. It iterates over the input list `lst` using `enumerate`, which gives both the index `i` and the corresponding `element`.
3. For each element, it calculates the sublist index using `i % n`, which effectively distributes the elements evenly across the `n` sublists.
4. Finally, it returns the list of sublists.

The assertions provided in the code cover various cases, including different types of elements (strings and integers) and varying lengths of lists. The function handles these cases correctly by distributing elements as specified.

I could not find any potential cases where the function fails to meet the requirements in the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
