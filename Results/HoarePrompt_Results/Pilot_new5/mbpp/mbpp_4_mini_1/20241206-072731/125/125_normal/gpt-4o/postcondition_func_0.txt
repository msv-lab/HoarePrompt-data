The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, distributing the elements of `lst` into `n` sublists in a round-robin manner. The function returns a list of these `n` sublists. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the result will contain empty sublists for the remaining indices. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to zero, nor does it validate whether `lst` is empty or contains fewer elements than `n`.
