The variable `result` is assigned the value of a list containing `n` empty lists, created by the list comprehension `[[] for _ in range(n)]`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `n <= len(lst)`, the output state will reflect that `result` is now a list of `n` empty lists, while `lst` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer such that `n <= len(lst)`, `result` is a list of `n` empty lists.**
