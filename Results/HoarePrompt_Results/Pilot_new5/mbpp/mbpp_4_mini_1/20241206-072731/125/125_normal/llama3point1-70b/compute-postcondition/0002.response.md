Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists, where each sublist consists of elements taken from `lst` starting at each index from 0 to n-1 and continuing in steps of `n`. It assumes that `n` is greater than 0 and does not handle cases where `lst` is empty, which would result in a list of empty sublists. **
