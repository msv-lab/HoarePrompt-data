The code updates the `result` list at the index `i % n`, which is `1 % n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `n >= 2`, `i % n` will always evaluate to `1`. Thus, the `element` (the second element in `lst`) is appended to `result[1]`.

Initially, `i` is `1`, `lst` has at least two elements, and `element` is defined as the second element of `lst`. The state of `result` after this operation will reflect that `element` has been appended to `result[1]`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 2`, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`, and `result[1]` has `element` appended to it.**
