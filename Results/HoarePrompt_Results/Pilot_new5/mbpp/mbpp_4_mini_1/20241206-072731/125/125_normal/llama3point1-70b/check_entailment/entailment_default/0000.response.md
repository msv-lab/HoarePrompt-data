To evaluate the given Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze them step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that takes in a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list for every `nth` element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Program Code
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Output Hints
The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists, where each sublist consists of elements taken from `lst` starting at each index from `0` to `n-1` and continuing in steps of `n`. It assumes that `n` is greater than 0 and does not handle cases where `lst` is empty, which would result in a list of empty sublists.

### Initial Assessment of the Code
1. The use of list slicing `lst[i::n]` creates sublists by starting at index `i` and then taking every `n`th element. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, it will generate `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`.
2. The code correctly implements splitting the list into sublists based on the given integer `n`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Empty List:** If `lst` is an empty list (`[]`), the code will return `[[], [], ...]` (with `n` empty sublists). This is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, which could imply that it doesn't handle such cases correctly.
2. **Single Element List:** If `lst` contains a single element and `n` is `1`, it will return `[[1]]`, which is correct.
3. **`n` Greater than List Length:** If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, it will return sublists where most will be empty, which may be the intended behavior but is not specifically stated.
4. **Negative or Zero Values for `n`:** The problem states that `n` should be a positive integer, but the code does not enforce this.

### Output Hints Agreement
The output hints state that the function "assumes that `n` is greater than 0" and does not handle cases where `lst` is empty. This aligns with our observation that if `lst` is empty, the function will still return a list of empty sublists, which may not be desirable depending on the intended functionality.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly:
- It does not account for an empty list properly.
- The handling of `n` should be validated to ensure it is positive, which the provided implementation does not enforce.

Hence, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, the Correctness is assessed as follows:

Correctness: **False**.
