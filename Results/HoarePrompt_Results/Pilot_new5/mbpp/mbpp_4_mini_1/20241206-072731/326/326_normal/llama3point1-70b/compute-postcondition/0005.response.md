The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. The previous value of `min_diff` was positive infinity, and the current value of `diff` is less than `min_diff`, meaning that `min_diff` will now hold the value of `diff`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, `diff` is abs(arr[0] - arr[1]), and the current value of `diff` is less than the previous `min_diff`.**
