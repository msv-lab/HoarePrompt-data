Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is a positive infinity, `i` is 0, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. If the current `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`, while `i` remains 0. If `diff` is not less than `min_diff`, the values of `min_diff`, `i`, and `diff` remain unchanged.***
