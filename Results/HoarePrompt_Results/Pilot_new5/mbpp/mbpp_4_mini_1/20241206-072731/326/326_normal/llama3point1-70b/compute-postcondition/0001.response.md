The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This indicates that `min_diff` is now set to a very large number, effectively acting as a placeholder for finding the minimum difference in subsequent calculations. The values of `arr` and `target` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity**.
