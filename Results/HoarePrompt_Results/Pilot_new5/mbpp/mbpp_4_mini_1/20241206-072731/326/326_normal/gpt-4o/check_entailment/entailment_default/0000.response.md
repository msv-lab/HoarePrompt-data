To assess the correctness of the provided function based on the given problem description, I will analyze the code and potential edge cases.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

### Initial Assessment
1. **Basic Functionality**: The function first checks if `n` (the length of the list) is less than 2. If it is, it correctly returns 0 since we can't find differences with fewer than two elements.
2. **Sorting**: The function sorts the array. This is necessary because the minimum difference will be found between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
3. **Finding Minimum Difference**: The function iterates through the sorted array and calculates differences between consecutive elements. It keeps track of the minimum difference found.

### Potential Edge Cases
- **Single Element or Empty Array**: The function correctly handles cases where `n < 2` by returning 0.
- **Identical Elements**: An important case to consider is when the array contains identical elements. For example, for `arr = [2, 2, 2]`, the minimum difference should be 0, but the current implementation would return `float('inf')` before checking the differences.
- **Negative Numbers**: The function does not specifically handle negative numbers differently. However, the calculation of differences will still work since subtraction is defined for negative integers.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `arr`, which aligns with what the code is doing. However, it doesn't mention how the code handles cases where all elements are the same.

### Conclusion
The code is not handling the case where all array elements are identical, as it would return a minimum difference of `float('inf')` instead of 0. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential input.

Correctness: **False**.
