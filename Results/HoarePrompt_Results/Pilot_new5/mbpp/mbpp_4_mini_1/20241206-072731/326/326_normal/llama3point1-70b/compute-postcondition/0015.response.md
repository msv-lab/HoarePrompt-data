Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`. If `arr` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `min_diff` remains positive infinity.**
