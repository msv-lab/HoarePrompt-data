The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is already defined as `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. The other variables `arr`, `target`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `min_diff` while maintaining the integrity of the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`, `i` is 2, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])**
