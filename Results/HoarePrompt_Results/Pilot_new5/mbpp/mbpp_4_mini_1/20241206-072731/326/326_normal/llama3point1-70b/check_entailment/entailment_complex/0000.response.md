The provided annotated program defines a function that aims to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, upon reviewing the implementation and the problem description, we see a discrepancy.

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is supposed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array `arr`. However, the function only computes the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This means that the function would not correctly handle cases where the minimum difference occurs between non-consecutive elements.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function assumes that the input list will always have at least two elements. If `arr` has fewer than two elements, the function does not adequately handle this case, and it would return positive infinity, which is not a valid output based on the problem description that implies finding a difference between elements.

3. **Overall Implementation**: While the function does correctly sort the array and compute differences between consecutive elements, it fails to consider all possible pairs of elements in the array. The minimum difference could occur between any two elements, not just those that are consecutive in the sorted order.

Given these points, the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
