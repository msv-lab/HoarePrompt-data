You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == (3, [13, 15, 17])
assert func_1([[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]) == (4, [10, 12, 14, 15])
assert func_1([[5], [15, 20, 25]]) == (3, [15, 20, 25])

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying lengths.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_len` remains 0 and `max_list` remains an empty list.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns max_len, which is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, and max_list, which is the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then max_len is 0 and max_list is an empty list.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
