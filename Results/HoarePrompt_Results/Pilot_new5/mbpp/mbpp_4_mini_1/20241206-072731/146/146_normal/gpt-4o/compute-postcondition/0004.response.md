The value of `max_len` is assigned the length of `lst`. Since `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists` and its length is greater than `max_len` (which is currently 0), `max_len` will now hold a positive integer value equal to `len(lst)`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 1 sublist, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is an empty list, and `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 1 sublist, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
