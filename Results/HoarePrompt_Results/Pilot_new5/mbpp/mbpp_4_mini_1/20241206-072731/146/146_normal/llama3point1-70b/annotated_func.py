#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can have varying lengths.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns max_len, which is the maximum length of the sublists in 'list_of_lists', and max_sublists[0], which is the first sublist from 'max_sublists' that contains sublists of length equal to max_len.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists, determines the maximum length of the sublists, and returns this maximum length along with the first sublist that has this maximum length. If the input list is empty, it will raise a ValueError due to attempting to compute the maximum on an empty sequence.
