The value of `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. The variable `lst` represents a specific sublist of `list_of_lists`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 sublists, `max_len` is equal to the length of the specific sublist `lst`, and `max_list` is equal to `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 sublists, `max_len` is equal to the length of the specific sublist `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
