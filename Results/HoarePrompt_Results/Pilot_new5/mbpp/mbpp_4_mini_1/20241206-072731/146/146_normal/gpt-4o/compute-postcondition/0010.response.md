Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 sublists. If the length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst` and `max_list` is equal to `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not greater than `max_len`, there are no changes to `max_len` or `max_list`.***
