The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list that contains sublists, where each sublist can have varying lengths. After executing the function body, it returns `max_len`, which is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`, and `max_sublists[0]`, which is the first sublist from `max_sublists` that contains sublists of length equal to `max_len`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return the maximum length of the sublists along with the first sublist that has the maximum length. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, and returns the maximum length of the sublists and the first sublist that has this maximum length.**
