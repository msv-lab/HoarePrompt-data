To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze both.

**Problem description:** The program should find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Functionality**: The program computes the maximum length of sublists within the provided list of lists and then creates a new list of those sublists that match this maximum length. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist that has this length.
  
2. **Potential Edge Cases**:
    - If `list_of_lists` is empty, calling `max()` on an empty sequence will raise a `ValueError`.
    - If there is only one sublist in the input, it should return that sublist and its length correctly, which seems to be handled.
    - If multiple sublists have the maximum length, only the first one is returned without any indication of the others, which seems acceptable based on the problem description.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state:
- The function accepts a list of lists, determines the maximum length of the sublists, and returns this maximum length along with the first sublist that has this maximum length.
- If the input list is empty, it will raise a ValueError due to attempting to compute the maximum on an empty sequence.

### Agreement Check:
- The output hints correctly summarize the functionality of the code. However, they highlight a significant edge case: calling `max()` on an empty list will raise an error. This indicates that the function does not handle the case of an empty input list properly, which contradicts the requirement that it should operate correctly for all cases.

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not handle the empty list case and will raise an error in that scenario, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation of Incorrectness**: The program fails when given an empty `list_of_lists`, as it raises a `ValueError` instead of returning a meaningful result. This is a crucial edge case that is not handled, rendering the function incorrect.
