To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the function `func_1` against the problem description: "Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists."

The function `func_1` is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
    return (max_len, max_list)
```

### Analysis of the Function:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list. This is appropriate as we need to track the maximum length found so far and the corresponding list.

2. **Iteration and Comparison**:
   - The function iterates over each list (`lst`) in the `list_of_lists`.
   - It compares the length of the current list `lst` with `max_len`. If `len(lst)` is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and assigns `lst` to `max_list`.

3. **Return Statement**: At the end, it returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.

### Edge Cases:

1. **Empty Input**: If `list_of_lists` is empty (`func_1([])`), the function will return `(0, [])`. According to the problem statement, this may not be the expected behavior since there are no lists to evaluate.

2. **Multiple Lists of Maximum Length**: If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, the function only returns the first one it encounters. For example, `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])` will return `(2, [1, 2])`, while another valid output could be `(2, [3, 4])` or `(2, [5, 6])`. The function does not account for this scenario as it does not clarify which list to return when there are ties.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the function fails to address the case of empty input and does not handle ties in maximum lengths appropriately. Thus, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
