You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the current value of the list `lst`, which is an empty list, is evaluated to False.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`, `i` is `len(lst_sorted) - 2`, and if the loop completes without returning False, then all consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` differ by 1. If `lst_sorted` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `lst_sorted` remains unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` differ by 1, given that the loop completed without returning False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `False` if the list is empty or if any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `lst` do not differ by 1. If all consecutive elements differ by 1, it returns `True`. However, if `lst` has fewer than 2 elements (which makes the check for consecutive differences irrelevant), the function will return `True` as well, because there are no pairs to compare.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
