Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria for checking whether a given list contains consecutive numbers:

1. **Sorting the List**: The program first sorts the list (`lst.sort()`). This is crucial because it allows the function to easily check for consecutive integers by comparing adjacent elements.

2. **Checking Consecutive Numbers**: The line `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` checks if the difference between every pair of adjacent elements in the sorted list is exactly 1. This is the key condition for the elements to be consecutive.

3. **Checking for Duplicates**: The condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` ensures that there are no duplicate numbers in the list. If the length of the list is the same as the length of the set (which removes duplicates), it confirms that all numbers are unique.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The explanation in the comments notes that if `lst` is empty or contains only one element, the function will return `False`. This aligns with the expectation that a list must contain at least two consecutive numbers to be considered valid.

5. **Output**: The function returns `True` only if both conditions (consecutiveness and uniqueness) are met, which directly addresses the problem's requirements.

In summary, the program effectively checks for both the uniqueness and consecutiveness of the integers in the list, adhering to the problem's requirements. Thus, the program is correct.
