According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `lst_sorted` is a sorted list that must have at least 2 elements. This means `len(lst_sorted)` is at least 2, so `len(lst_sorted) - 1` is at least 1, allowing for one more iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1. The list `lst_sorted` must still have at least 2 elements in order for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
