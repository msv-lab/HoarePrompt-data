Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Sorting the List:** The function sorts the input list `lst` to arrange the numbers in ascending order. This is essential to check for consecutive numbers, as consecutive numbers must appear in a sequential order.

2. **Checking for Consecutive Numbers:** The program uses a generator expression within the `all()` function, which checks if the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers in the sorted list is exactly 1. This is the core requirement to ensure that the numbers are consecutive.

3. **Checking for Duplicates:** The function also checks that the length of the sorted list is equal to the length of the set of the list. This ensures that there are no duplicates in the list, as sets automatically discard duplicate entries. If there are duplicates, it indicates that the same number appears multiple times, which would violate the definition of consecutive numbers.

4. **Return Value:** The function returns `True` if both conditions (consecutive numbers and no duplicates) are satisfied, otherwise it returns `False`.

This implementation covers all potential cases where a list may or may not contain consecutive integers, thus fulfilling the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
