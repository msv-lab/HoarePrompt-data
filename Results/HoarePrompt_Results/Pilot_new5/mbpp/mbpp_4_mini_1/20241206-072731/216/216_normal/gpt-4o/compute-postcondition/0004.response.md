According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop is set to run from `0` to `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than 1, meaning `lst_sorted` must contain at least 2 elements.

Additionally, the loop variable `i` will start at `0`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the conditions are that `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will be initialized to 0. 

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
