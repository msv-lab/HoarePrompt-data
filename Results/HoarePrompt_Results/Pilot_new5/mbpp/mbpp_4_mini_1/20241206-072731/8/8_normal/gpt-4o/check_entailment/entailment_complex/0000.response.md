Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement to remove both the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string in all cases. 

Specifically, the issue arises when the character `ch` appears only once in the string `s`. In this case, according to the problem description, the function should return the original string without any changes. However, the code only returns the original string if `first_index` equals `last_index`, which would be true only if the character `ch` is found at the same index (indicating that there is only one occurrence). This logic is somewhat misleading because it's not clear in the explanation that it would return the original string under that condition.

Additionally, if `ch` appears at the beginning and end of the string with only one occurrence in between, the function will fail to remove both as it is designed to look for different indices. 

For instance:
- Input: `s = "aXbXcX"`, `ch = "X"` should return `"aXb"` but will return `"aXbXc"` instead.
  
Thus, there are cases where the function does not fulfill the requirement of removing both the first and last occurrences of `ch`, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect based on the problem description.
