The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `char`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `char` is a single character. 

- If `char` occurs exactly once in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with that single occurrence of `char` removed.
- If `char` occurs more than once, the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed.
- If `char` does not occur in `s`, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `char`, and based on the occurrences of `char` in `s`, it modifies the string accordingly: removing a single occurrence, removing the first and last occurrences, or returning the original string if `char` is not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string s and a single character char, returning a modified version of s by removing char based on its occurrences; if char appears once, it removes that occurrence; if char appears more than once, it removes the first and last occurrences; if char is not found, it returns the original string s.**
