The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. This means that `high` will now be equal to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer; `low` is 0; `high` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1`; `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`; `result` is `mid`.**
