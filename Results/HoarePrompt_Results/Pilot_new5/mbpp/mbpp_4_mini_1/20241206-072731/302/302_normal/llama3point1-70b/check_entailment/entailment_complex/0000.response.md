Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It searches for the first occurrence of a given number (`num`) in a sorted array (`arr`) and returns its index if found. If the number does not exist in the array, it returns -1.

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a sorted list of integers, and `num`, which is an integer to search for in the list.

2. **Search Mechanism**: It uses a simple loop (`for (i, x) in enumerate(arr)`) to iterate through the sorted list. The `enumerate` function allows keeping track of both the index (`i`) and the value (`x`) at that index.

3. **Condition Checking**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `x` is equal to `num`. If a match is found, it immediately returns the index `i`, which corresponds to the first occurrence of `num`.

4. **Handling Non-Existence**: If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function returns -1, as specified in the annotations, indicating that `num` is not present in the list.

5. **Performance**: While it uses a linear search method, which is acceptable for small arrays, the requirement of finding the "first occurrence" aligns with the problem description, making it suitable for scenarios where the input size is not excessively large.

Overall, the program meets the problem description effectively and handles all edge cases outlined within the annotations. Therefore, it is correct.
