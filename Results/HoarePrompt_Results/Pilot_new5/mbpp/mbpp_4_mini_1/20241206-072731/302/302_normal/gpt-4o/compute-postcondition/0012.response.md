Postcondition: ***`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer. If the current value of `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `((len(arr) - 1) // 2) + 1`, and `high` remains `len(arr) - 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `low` remains 0. In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and the value of `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`.***
