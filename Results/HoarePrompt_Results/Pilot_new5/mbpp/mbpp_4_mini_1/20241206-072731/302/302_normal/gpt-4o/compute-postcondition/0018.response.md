The code changes the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. The variable `mid` is previously defined as `(low + high) // 2`, meaning `low` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. The constraints on the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `low`, while the other variables retain their original constraints.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer; `low` is equal to `mid + 1; `high` remains unchanged; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2.**
