The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `num`. The parameter `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `num` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on specific cases:

- In Case_1, it returns index `i`, which indicates the position of the first element in the sorted list `arr`.
- In Case_2, it returns the value 1, which represents the value of `i`.
- In Case_3, it returns the value of `i`, which is 2.
- In Case_4, it returns -1, indicating that the number `num` is not present in the sorted list of integers `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, and it returns the index of certain conditions based on the presence and position of `num` within the sorted list `arr`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr (a sorted list of integers) and num (an integer), returning the index of num if present, or -1 if num is not present in arr.**
