To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the provided loop code and consider the implications of its execution.

In the given loop:
```
for i, x in enumerate(arr):
    if x == num:
        return i
```

The loop iterates over the sorted list `arr`, checking each element `x` to see if it is equal to `num`. If an element equal to `num` is found, the function returns the index `i` of that element. 

Now, let's establish the output states for different scenarios based on the number of times the loop executes.

### Output State after the loop executes 1 time:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 1 element.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is the first element in `arr`.
- If `x` is not equal to `num`, the loop continues.

### Output State after the loop executes 2 times:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is the second element in `arr`.
- If `x` is equal to `num`, the function returns 1. If `x` is not equal to `num`, the loop continues.

### Output State after the loop executes 3 times:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is the third element in `arr`.
- If `x` is equal to `num`, the function returns 2. Otherwise, the loop continues.

After considering the implications of the loop, we can summarize the final output state when the loop finishes executing. If the loop completes without finding `num`, it means `num` is not present in `arr`. If it finds `num`, it would have returned the index during one of the iterations, and the loop would not continue.

### Final Output State:
- If `num` is found in `arr`, it is at index `i`, where `i` is the index of the first occurrence of `num`.
- If `num` is not found, the function reaches the end of `arr`, and the output state reflects that `num` is not in `arr`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations have completed is:
Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `num` may or may not be present in `arr`. If present, it is at index `i`, otherwise the loop has finished without finding `num`.**
