Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, it does not handle the case where the target number is not present in the array correctly. 

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)`, the function will return `-1`, which is expected in this case. However, since there is no check or return statement indicating that the target number can be absent, it could potentially mislead users into thinking it has found a valid index when it hasn't, depending on context.

Additionally, the assertions before the function definition are not a part of the function's logic and should not affect its correctness, but they can create confusion about the expected behavior.

Thus, while it does find the first occurrence correctly when the target exists, it fails to indicate the absence of the target in a clear manner.
