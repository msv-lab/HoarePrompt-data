#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string containing at least one character.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string containing at least one character, and the condition (not `s`) is false, meaning `s` is not an empty string.
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string containing at least one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all characters in the string 's' are equal to the first character 'first_char'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns True if all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, it returns False. If `s` is empty, the function will not handle this case correctly since the initial condition checks for an empty string does not apply, as the comment indicates that `s` contains at least one character. Thus, the function will always return True if `s` has only one unique character repeated throughout, otherwise it returns False upon finding a different character.
