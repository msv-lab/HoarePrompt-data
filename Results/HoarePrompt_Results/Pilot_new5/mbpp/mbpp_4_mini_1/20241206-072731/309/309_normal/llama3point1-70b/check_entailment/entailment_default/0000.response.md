Upon examining the problem description and the provided code, it states that the goal is to check whether all characters in a string are the same. The function `func_1(s)` uses a set to determine this: it converts the string into a set of characters and checks if the length of the set is 1. This means that if there is only one unique character in the string, it returns True. 

### Initial Assessment:
- The function does return `True` for a string with all identical characters.
- If the string is empty, `set(s)` will also be an empty set, and its length will be 0, so it returns `False`. 

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty String:** For an empty string, `set(s)` returns an empty set, which results in `len(set(s))` being 0. The function would return `False`, which contradicts the output hints that say it would return `True` for an empty string.
2. **Single Character String:** For a string with a single character (e.g., `"a"`), the function correctly returns `True`.
3. **Multiple Characters:** For strings like `"aaa"`, it returns `True`, which is correct.

### Evaluation of Output Hints:
The output hints claim that for an empty string, the function would return `True`, which is incorrect based on the code. The code would return `False` for an empty string. Thus, there is a discrepancy between the output hints and the actual behavior of the code.

### Conclusion:
The code does not accurately reflect the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, specifically for the edge case of an empty string where it does not conform to the expected output as per the hints. 

Correctness: **False**.
