Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set, which inherently removes duplicate characters. If the length of this set is equal to 1, it implies that all characters in the string are the same.

Here's why the code is correct for all potential cases:

1. **Empty string**: An empty string `""` will result in a set of length 0. The function would return `False`, which is appropriate since there are no characters to compare.

2. **Single character string**: For a string like `"a"`, the set would contain one element, and the function would return `True`, which is correct.

3. **Multiple same characters**: For a string like `"aaaa"`, the set will again contain one element, resulting in a `True` return value.

4. **Different characters**: For a string like `"abc"`, the set will have multiple elements, resulting in a `False` return value, which is also correct.

5. **Mixed case**: For a string like `"AaA"`, the function will treat 'A' and 'a' as different characters, returning `False`, which conforms to the requirement.

Since the function behaves correctly for all these cases and adheres to the problem description, it is deemed correct.
