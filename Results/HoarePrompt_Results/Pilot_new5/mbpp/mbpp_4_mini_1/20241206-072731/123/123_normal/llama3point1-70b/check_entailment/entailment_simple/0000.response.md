Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it meets all the criteria:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `L`, which is a non-negative integer. 

2. **Splitting Logic**: The function uses slicing to split the list:
   - `lst[:L]` retrieves the first `L` elements of the list.
   - `lst[L:]` retrieves the elements from index `L` to the end of the list.

3. **Tuple Return**: The function returns a tuple containing the two resulting lists from the split operation, which matches the requirement to return the resulting lists in a tuple.

4. **Condition on L**: The problem description states that `L` must satisfy the condition `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. The program's slicing handles this correctly:
   - If `L` is 0, `lst[:L]` will return an empty list, and `lst[L:]` will return the entire list.
   - If `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, `lst[:L]` will return the entire list, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list.
   - For any value of `L` within the specified range, the program behaves as expected.

Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description for all valid inputs, confirming its correctness.
