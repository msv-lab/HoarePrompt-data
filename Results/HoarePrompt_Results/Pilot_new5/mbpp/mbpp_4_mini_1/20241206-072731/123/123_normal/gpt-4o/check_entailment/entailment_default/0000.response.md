To evaluate the provided program `func_1` against the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description
The problem requires a function that splits a given list into two parts based on a specified length `L`. The first part should contain the first `L` elements of the list, while the second part should contain the remainder of the list. 

### Code Analysis
The code provided is:
```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

- The function takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
- It splits the list using slicing. The first part is `lst[:L]` (which gives elements from the start up to index `L` exclusive), and the second part is `lst[L:]` (which gives the elements from index `L` to the end).

### Edge Cases Consideration
1. **When `L` is 0**: The first part will be empty (`[]`), and the second part will be the entire list. This is correctly handled.
2. **When `L` equals the length of `lst`**: The first part will contain all elements of the list, and the second part will be empty (`[]`). This is also handled correctly.
3. **When `L` is greater than the length of `lst`**: The first part will be the entire list, and the second part will be empty (`[]`). This case is handled correctly as well, as slicing in Python does not raise an error when the index is out of bounds.

### Output Hints
The output hints confirm that the function should:
- Accept a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`.
- Return two slices: the first being `lst[:L]` and the second `lst[L:]`.
- Handle edge cases as described above.

The output hints mention specific scenarios:
- If `L` is `0`, the result should be `([], [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1])` for the first example.
- If `L` equals the length of the list, it should return the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part.

### Verification
Since the code correctly implements the functionality as per the problem description, including handling the edge cases, and the output hints also align with this understanding, the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` accurately splits the list as required by the problem description, correctly handles edge cases (including when `L` is 0 or greater than the length of the list), and the output hints confirm the expected behavior of the code. Therefore, all potential cases are adequately covered.
