Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and it splits the list into two parts: the first part contains the first `L` elements of the list, while the second part contains the remaining elements. 

Hereâ€™s how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts any list (denoted by `lst`) and a non-negative integer `L`. The annotations specify that `L` is constrained such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, ensuring that it is always a valid index for slicing the list.

2. **Slicing Logic**: The function uses Python's list slicing feature:
   - `lst[:L]` correctly takes the first `L` elements of `lst`.
   - `lst[L:]` correctly takes the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases as described:
   - If `L` is `0`, `lst[:L]` will result in an empty list `[]`, and `lst[L:]` will return the entire list. This behavior satisfies the requirement that the first part can be empty while the second contains the full list.
   - If `L` equals the length of `lst`, `lst[:L]` will return the entire list, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list `[]`. This again meets the requirement of splitting the list correctly.

Since the function accurately divides the input list as specified and handles edge cases appropriately, it fulfills the problem description correctly.
