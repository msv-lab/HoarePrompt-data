The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. The parameter `lst` is a list of any elements, and the parameter `L` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)} \). After executing the function, it returns two lists: the first list is a slice of `lst` from the start up to index `L` (exclusive), and the second list is a slice of `lst` from index `L` to the end. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and return two slices of the list based on the index `L`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a non-negative integer L, and returns two slices: the first slice from the start of lst up to index L (exclusive), and the second slice from index L to the end of lst.**
