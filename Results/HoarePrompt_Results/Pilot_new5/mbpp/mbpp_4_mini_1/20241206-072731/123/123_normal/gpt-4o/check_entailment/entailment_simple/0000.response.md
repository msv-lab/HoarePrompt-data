Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and an integer `L`. The problem description specifies that `L` should be a non-negative integer and that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, which is correctly assumed in the assertion comments preceding the function definition.

2. **Splitting the List**: The function uses slicing to split the list into two parts:
   - The first part is obtained using `lst[:L]`, which slices the list from the beginning up to, but not including, index `L`. This corresponds to the first part of the output as specified in the problem description.
   - The second part is obtained using `lst[L:]`, which slices the list from index `L` to the end. This corresponds to the second part of the output as specified.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple containing the two parts of the split list, which matches the requirement of returning the result in a tuple.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions serve as test cases that validate the function against various scenarios, including different types of elements (integers and strings) and different lengths for `L`. The function passes all these assertions, confirming its correctness.

In summary, the function `func_1` adheres to the problem requirements by correctly splitting the input list into two parts based on the given integer `L` and returning the result as a tuple.
