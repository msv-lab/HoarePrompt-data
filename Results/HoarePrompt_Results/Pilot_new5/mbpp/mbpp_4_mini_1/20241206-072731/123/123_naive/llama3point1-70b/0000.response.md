Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when L is greater than the length of the list. In such a case, the first part of the tuple would be the entire list, and the second part would be an empty list. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `L = 5`, the expected output should ideally reflect that L exceeds the list length, but the current implementation would still return `([1, 2, 3], [])`, which does not indicate any error or handle this edge case explicitly. The function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
