Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple (`tup`) and an element (`elem`) as parameters. It utilizes the `count()` method on the tuple to determine how many times `elem` appears within `tup`. This directly aligns with the problem's stipulation to count the occurrences of a specified element in the provided tuple.

The `count()` method works for all possible data types that can be contained within a tuple, making the function robust and applicable for any input as described. Therefore, the implementation meets the problem description requirements consistently for all potential cases.
