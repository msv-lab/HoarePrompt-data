The function provided in the program aims to count the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The implementation uses the `count` method which is inherently designed to return the count of a specific value within a tuple.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Code Explanation**: 
   - The function `func_1(tup, elem)` takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`.
   - It returns the count of how many times `elem` appears in `tup` using the built-in method `tup.count(elem)`.

2. **Edge Cases Consideration**:
   - If `elem` is not present in `tup`, the `count` method correctly returns `0`.
   - The function should handle all types of elements (integers, strings, etc.) as tuples can contain mixed data types.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm the function's behavior:
- The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.
- It handles cases where `elem` is not present, returning `0`.

### Conclusion:
Both the problem description and the output hints align with the implementation of the function. It covers potential edge cases effectively (e.g., elements not found in the tuple or handling different data types).

Therefore, there are no discrepancies or missing logic in the code with respect to the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**.
