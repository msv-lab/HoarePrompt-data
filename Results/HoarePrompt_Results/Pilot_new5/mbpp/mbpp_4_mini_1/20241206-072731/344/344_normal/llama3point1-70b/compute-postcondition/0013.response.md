Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, returning the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the value. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list. If the list is empty, it returns 0. The function does not handle the case where the first element is less than the value, as there are no checks for returning 1 or 2 based on the annotations.**
