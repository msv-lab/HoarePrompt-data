#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index in 'sorted_list' where 'value' would be inserted to maintain sorted order, using bisect.bisect_right.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order (`sorted_list`) and an integer (`value`). It returns the index at which `value` can be inserted into `sorted_list` while maintaining the order. If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, it returns the length of the list, indicating the position at the end. If `value` is smaller than or equal to the first element, it returns 0, indicating the position at the start. This behavior ensures that the insertion point is correctly identified for any integer value.
