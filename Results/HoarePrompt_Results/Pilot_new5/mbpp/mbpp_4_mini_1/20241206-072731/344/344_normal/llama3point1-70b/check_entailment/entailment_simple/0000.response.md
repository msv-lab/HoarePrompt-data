Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` receives a list called `sorted_list`, which is guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer `value` that may or may not be in `sorted_list`.

2. **Insertion Point Identification**:
   - The function iterates through each element in `sorted_list` using a for loop.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`. If it is, the function returns the index `i`, which is the correct insertion point for the `value`. This is because for a sorted list, the first occurrence of an element that is greater than or equal to `value` indicates the position where `value` can be inserted while maintaining the order.

3. **Handling Cases**:
   - If `value` is less than all elements in `sorted_list`, the loop will complete without returning, and the function will return `len(sorted_list)`, which correctly indicates that `value` should be inserted at the end of the list.
   - If `sorted_list` is empty, the function also correctly returns `0` (since `len(sorted_list)` is `0`), which indicates the proper insertion point for any value.

Thus, for every scenario defined by the problem description (whether the `value` is smaller than all elements, larger than all elements, or fits somewhere in between), the program behaves as required and returns the correct insertion point. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description and is considered correct.
