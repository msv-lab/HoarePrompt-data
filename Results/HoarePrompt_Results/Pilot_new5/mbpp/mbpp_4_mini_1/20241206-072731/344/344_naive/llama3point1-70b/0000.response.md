Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case when the `value` is greater than all elements in the `sorted_list`. In this situation, the insertion point should be at the end of the list, but the function will return the length of the list, which is correct. However, the loop logic has a potential issue when `sorted_list` is empty.

For example, consider the following test case:
- `sorted_list = []`
- `value = 5`

In this case, the function should return `0`, indicating that the `value` should be inserted at the beginning of the empty list. 

However, since the loop does not execute due to the empty list, the function will return `len(sorted_list)`, which is `0`. 

Thus, the function fails to correctly identify the insertion point for an empty list, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is incorrect.
