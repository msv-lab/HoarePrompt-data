Correctness: **False**.

The provided implementation of `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right`, which returns the insertion point for the specified value in a sorted list such that all elements to the left of this point are less than or equal to the value. However, the problem description specifically asks for the right insertion point in sorted order, and the assertions made in the code do not cover all edge cases. 

For example, consider the scenario where the input list is empty and the value is 1. The expected insertion point for the value 1 in an empty list should be 0, but this case is not explicitly tested in the assertions. Additionally, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 2)`, it would return 2, which is the right insertion point, but if we call it with the value 1, it should correctly return the position 0, as 1 is less than the smallest element in the list.

Therefore, there are potential cases that the program does not handle correctly, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
