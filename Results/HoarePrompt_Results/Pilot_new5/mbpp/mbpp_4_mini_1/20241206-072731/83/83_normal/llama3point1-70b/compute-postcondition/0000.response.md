`n` is assigned the value of `len(arr)`, which represents the length of the list `arr`. The state of the variable `arr` remains unchanged, while `n` now holds the integer value corresponding to the number of elements in `arr`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other; `n` is the length of `arr`.**
