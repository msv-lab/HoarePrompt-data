The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of elements of any type. If the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) is greater than 1, the function returns the list `arr` sorted in non-increasing order. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `arr` unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return it sorted in non-increasing order if the list contains more than one element, or return the list unchanged if it contains one or zero elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr (a list of elements of any type) and returns the list sorted in non-increasing order if it contains more than one element; otherwise, it returns the list unchanged if it contains one or zero elements.**
