The function accepts a non-negative integer `end`, and it reverses the elements of a global list `arr` from index `0` to `end`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `arr` is not defined or when `end` is greater than the length of `arr`, which could lead to an IndexError. If `end` is less than `0`, the function will not perform any operation.
