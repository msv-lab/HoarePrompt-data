According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues as long as `i < n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1, since with `n = 1`, the range would be empty. Additionally, at the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `n - 1`. 

So, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1, and before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 1, which is the starting value for the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of elements with at least `n` elements, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**
