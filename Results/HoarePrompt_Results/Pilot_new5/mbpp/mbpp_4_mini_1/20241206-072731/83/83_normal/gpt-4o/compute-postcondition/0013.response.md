The function `find_max_index` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list, and `arr` is a list of elements that contains at least `n` elements. The function returns the index of the maximum element among the first `n` elements of the list `arr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `find_max_index` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `arr`, and return the index of the maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list arr, and returns the index of the maximum element in the first n elements of arr.**
