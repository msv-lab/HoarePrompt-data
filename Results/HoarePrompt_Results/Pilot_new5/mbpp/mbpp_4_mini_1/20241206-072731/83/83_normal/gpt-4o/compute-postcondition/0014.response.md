Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the index of the maximum element in a global list `arr` from the first `n` elements. If `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, this could potentially lead to an IndexError, as the function does not handle cases where `n` exceeds the number of available elements in `arr`. **
