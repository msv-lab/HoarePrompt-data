To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the implementation against the problem description, which states that the function should sort a list of elements.

1. **Examine the code structure**:
   - The function `func_1(arr)` is intended to sort the list `arr`.
   - It uses a method involving a series of "flips" to rearrange the elements of the list to achieve the sorted order.

2. **Identify potential issues**:
   - The `flip` function reverses the elements from the start index to the end index of the list `arr`. However, `arr` is not passed as a parameter to `flip`, which means it will lead to a `NameError` because `arr` is not defined within `flip`.
   - The `find_max_index` function also has the same issue: it references `arr` without it being defined in its scope.

3. **Test case for failure**:
   - If I attempt to run `func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69])`, it will result in a `NameError` when it tries to access `arr` in `find_max_index` and `flip`.

Given this analysis, I can conclude that the program does not satisfy the problem description as it fails to sort the list due to scope issues with the variable `arr`.

Correctness: **False**.
