To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description of sorting a list of elements, we need to analyze the code to identify any potential edge cases or scenarios where the program might not perform as expected.

The function `func_1` implements a sorting algorithm (specifically a variant similar to selection sort), which attempts to sort the input list in place. The algorithm works by repeatedly finding the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list, reversing the list up to the maximum element, and then reversing the entire unsorted portion of the list.

Now, let's consider potential cases that could break this approach:

1. **Empty List**: If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function should return `[]`. Since the code handles this case without errors, it works correctly here.
   
2. **Single Element List**: For a single element list, e.g., `[5]`, the function should return `[5]`. The code handles this case correctly as well.

3. **Already Sorted List**: If the list is already sorted, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, the code should be able to process this and return the same list. The code does this correctly.

4. **All Elements Identical**: If the list contains identical elements, e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`, the function should return `[2, 2, 2]`. The code handles this correctly since reversing identical elements does not change the list.

5. **Reverse Sorted List**: Let's consider a case like `[3, 2, 1]`. The expected output is `[1, 2, 3]`. The algorithm should handle this case correctly by reversing segments to eventually place the smallest element in the correct position.

6. **Performance on Larger Inputs**: For larger and more random inputs, the algorithm's efficiency is not optimal (O(n^2) complexity), but it does not break the sorting requirement.

However, a critical case to evaluate involves negative numbers or mixed numbers, such as `[-1, 0, 1]`. The function does not appear to encounter issues sorting these kinds of arrays since the logic is not dependent on the actual numeric value but rather on the relative positions.

Despite the program handling various cases as mentioned above, let's consider an edge case that it fails. For example, if the input is `[3, 1, 2]`, the maximum is `3`, and the reversing takes it to `[2, 1, 3]`, and subsequently reversing `[2, 1, 3]` results in `[1, 2, 3]`. This part works.

Upon deeper inspection, the fundamental issue arises when there are duplicate elements and the maximum element needs to be at the last position. The code does not always guarantee a full sort because of how the indices are manipulated, potentially leading to an incorrect final order.

For instance, if we have the input `[4, 1, 4, 3]`, the algorithm will not necessarily yield a properly sorted list due to its reliance on the first occurrence of the maximum value found, which can lead to incorrect intermediate states.

Given these observations, the code fails to sort the list in a reliable manner for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
