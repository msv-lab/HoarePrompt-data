Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues. Firstly, the function `flip()` and `find_max_index()` are not using the array `arr` correctly. The `find_max_index()` function does not have access to the `arr` variable, which will cause a `NameError`. This means that the function will not work at all, regardless of the input provided, resulting in failure to sort the array as intended.

Additionally, the logic for sorting using the pancake sorting method seems incomplete. The program lacks the handling of cases where the array may be empty or contain duplicate elements. 

For example, calling `func_1([])` would not be handled correctly since it would result in an error due to `n` being 0 and leading to issues in the for loop.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem requirements for every potential input case, leading to correctness being labeled as False.
