Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the area of a rectangle based on the given length and width. It uses the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is `length * width`. 

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `length` and `width`.
2. It returns the product of these two parameters, which represents the area.
3. The program works correctly for all possible positive numeric values for `length` and `width`.
4. Additionally, it naturally handles cases where either `length` or `width` is zero, returning zero for the area, which is also mathematically accurate.

There are no edge cases in the provided description that would lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
