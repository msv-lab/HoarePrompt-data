Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The assertions provided in the program verify that the function works for the given test cases, and there are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to fail for valid inputs. The multiplication of two non-negative numbers is reliably accurate in Python, so the function behaves as expected for typical rectangle dimensions.
