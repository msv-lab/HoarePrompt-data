The function accepts two positive real numbers, `length` and `width`, and returns the area of the rectangle calculated as `length` multiplied by `width`. It assumes that both inputs are positive real numbers and does not handle cases where the inputs may be zero or negative, which could lead to incorrect interpretations of area.
