Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from the list `lst` in the tuple `tup`. It uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to count each element of `lst` in `tup`.

### Explanation:
1. The function iterates over each element in the list `lst`.
2. For each element, it uses the `count()` method of the tuple `tup` to find how many times that element appears in the tuple.
3. The results of these counts are summed up and returned.

The function handles the following cases correctly:
- If `lst` is empty, it returns `0` because there are no elements to count.
- If `tup` is empty, it also returns `0` since there are no occurrences of any element from `lst`.
- If there are elements in `lst` that do not exist in `tup`, they will naturally contribute `0` to the sum, which is correct behavior.

Since no potential cases that break the functionâ€™s logic or that deviate from the problem description can be identified, the implementation is deemed correct.
