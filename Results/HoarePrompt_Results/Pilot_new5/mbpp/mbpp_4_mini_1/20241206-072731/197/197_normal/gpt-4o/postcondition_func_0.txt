The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and returns the total count of how many times each element from `elements` appears in `tup`, represented as a non-negative integer. It correctly counts occurrences even if `elements` is empty or if none of the elements are found in `tup`, returning 0 in those cases.
