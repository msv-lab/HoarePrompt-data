Examining the provided program and problem description:

**Problem description**: 
Write a python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

**Output hints**: 
The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and returns the total count of how many times each element from `elements` appears in `tup`, represented as a non-negative integer. It correctly counts occurrences even if `elements` is empty or if none of the elements are found in `tup`, returning 0 in those cases.

### Initial Assessment:
The code appears to implement the functionality to count occurrences of elements in `tup` as outlined in the problem description. The use of `tup.count(element)` inside a generator expression to accumulate counts for each element from `elements` seems to be correct. However, I need to consider edge cases.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. If `elements` is an empty list, the function should return 0, which is confirmed by the output hints.
2. If `tup` is empty, regardless of the `elements` list, the function should return 0, which is also covered by the hints.
3. If `elements` contains items that are not in `tup`, the function should also correctly return a count based on what is present.

### Output Hints Agreement:
The hints state that the function covers cases with empty `elements` and when no elements are found in `tup`, returning 0 in such scenarios. The given assertions also seem to validate that the function behaves as expected under these conditions.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the program and the hints, the code meets the problem description requirements for all potential cases. There are no identified edge cases where the code fails to provide the expected output.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly counts occurrences of the specified elements in the tuple, including edge cases where the list of elements is empty or none of the elements are present in the tuple.
