Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to count the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`. This matches the inputs stipulated in the problem description.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: Inside the function, the program uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to iterate over each `element` in the `elements` list. For each `element`, it calls `tup.count(element)`, which counts how many times that particular `element` appears in the `tup` tuple.

3. **Return Value**: The program correctly returns the total count of occurrences of all specified elements from the list in the tuple, which is the expected output as per the problem description.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test various cases to ensure that the function behaves as expected:
   - The first assertion checks for two occurrences of 'a' and one occurrence of 'b' in the tuple, totaling 3.
   - The second assertion includes multiple occurrences of '1' and '4' and one occurrence of '7', returning a total of 6.
   - The third assertion verifies that there are two occurrences of '1' and '2' in the tuple, resulting in a total of 2.

Each case validates that the total count of occurrences is accurately computed according to the elements specified.

Thus, since the program meets all requirements as described, we can conclude that it is correct.
