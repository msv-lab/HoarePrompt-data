The provided program `func_1` aims to count the occurrences of all elements of a list `lst` in a tuple `tup`. The implementation uses a generator expression and the `count` method of tuples to sum up the occurrences for each element in the list.

Let's analyze the code against the problem description:

1. **Basic Functionality**: The code correctly implements the logic to count occurrences of elements in the tuple for each element in the list. It uses `tup.count(element)`, which accurately counts how many times `element` appears in `tup`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle an empty list (`lst`). If `lst` is empty, the generator expression would yield no elements, and thus `sum` will return `0` as expected. This is aligned with the problem description, as there are no elements to count.
   - The program should also consider cases where `tup` contains no matching elements. In this case, `tup.count(element)` would return `0` for each element in `lst` that is not found in `tup`, and the cumulative sum would still be `0`. This also aligns with the problem description.

Now let's check the output hints:

- The output hints confirm that the function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `lst` within the tuple `tup`. 
- It states that the function does not handle cases where `lst` is empty, which is somewhat misleading; the code does indeed handle the empty list case correctly by returning `0`.

After analyzing both the program and the output hints, it becomes clear that the program functions correctly for the provided problem description. The edge cases and the stated behavior of the function are accounted for.

Correctness: **True**.
