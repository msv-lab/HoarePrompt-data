Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of integer elements in the input list. Here's a breakdown:

1. It uses a generator expression that iterates through each element in the list `lst`.
2. For each element, it checks whether the element is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`.
3. The `sum` function then aggregates all the `1`s generated for each integer found, effectively counting them.

The assertions provided in the program are checked against the expected output:
- For the input `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`, it correctly returns `2` because there are two integers (`1` and `2`).
- For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, it returns `3` since all elements are integers.
- For the input `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]`, it returns `2` because only `1` and `4` are integers.

I could not find any edge cases or potential inputs that would make the function fail to return the correct number of integer elements. Therefore, the function behaves correctly across the provided test cases and should work for any general list input containing integers, floats, strings, or other types.

Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.
