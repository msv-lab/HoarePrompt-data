To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step:

**Problem Description:** The task is to write a Python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((isinstance(x, int) for x in lst))
```

**Initial Assessment:** 
The function uses a generator expression to check if each element `x` in the list `lst` is an instance of `int`, and sums up the results (where `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0). This logically means that it counts how many elements in the list are integers. 

**Edge Cases Consideration:**
1. If the list is empty, it should return 0, which is handled correctly.
2. If all elements are non-integer types (e.g., strings, floats), it should also return 0, which is handled correctly.
3. If the list contains a mix of data types, it should correctly count only the integer elements.

So far, the function appears to handle the problem description correctly for the potential cases that I can think of.

**Output Hints:** 
The output hints state that the function:
- Accepts a list `lst` with various types of elements.
- Returns the count of integer elements.
- Does not handle cases where the list is empty or when all elements are non-integer types, but it will return 0 in such cases.

The output hints agree with the code, as the function will indeed return 0 for both an empty list and a list without any integers. 

**Conclusion:** 
Based on the analysis, the program matches the problem description and successfully handles various input cases as described. There are no edge cases that lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the function appears to be working correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
