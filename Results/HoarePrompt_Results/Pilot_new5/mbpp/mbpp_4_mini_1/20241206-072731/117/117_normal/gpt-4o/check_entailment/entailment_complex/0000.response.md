Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and counts the number of integer elements within that list. 

Here's why it meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Counting Integers**: The function uses a generator expression that iterates over each element in the list and checks whether it is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`. For each integer found, it sums 1, effectively counting how many integers are present in the list.

2. **Handling Various Input Types**: The function correctly identifies integers and does not count other types (like strings or floats) as integers. This behavior aligns with the problem's requirement to count only integer elements.

3. **Empty List Handling**: The function will return `0` if the input list is empty, which is the correct behavior since there are no integers in an empty list.

4. **Correctness of Assertions**: The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the example cases, producing the correct integer count for each specified input list.

Given these points, the function effectively meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
