Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function must return the number of integer elements in a given list. 

Here's how the program meets this requirement:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
2. It uses a generator expression `isinstance(x, int) for x in lst` to check each element `x` in the list `lst`. This expression evaluates to `True` for elements that are integers and `False` for those that are not.
3. The `sum` function is then used to count the number of `True` values returned by the generator expression, effectively counting how many integers are present in the list.

This approach ensures that all elements of the list are checked, and only those that are integers are counted. Since Python's `isinstance` function accurately identifies integers, the program will always produce the correct count of integer elements in the list, regardless of the types of elements in the list.

Therefore, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
