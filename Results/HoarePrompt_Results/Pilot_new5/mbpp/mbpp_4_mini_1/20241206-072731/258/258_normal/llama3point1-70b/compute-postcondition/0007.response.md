According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `num_str`. The loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` has been processed up to a certain digit, and we need to determine which digit corresponds to the next iteration and the total number of digits in `num_str`. 

Since `num_len` is equal to `num_len`, we can interpret this as `num_len` being the length of `num_str`. To execute the loop one more time, `num_str` must have at least one more digit than has been processed so far, meaning we need to increase the index of processed digits. 

If `num_len` is equal to the length of `num_str`, then we have processed all digits in `num_str`, and the loop will not execute again. Assuming that the loop has processed `num_len - 1` digits so far, we need to adjust `num_len` to reflect the next digit, so it will be `num_len` incremented by 1.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is equal to `num_len + 1`, `sum` is updated by adding `int(digit)`**
