`num_str` is assigned the value of `str(num)`, which converts the non-negative integer `num` into its string representation. The value of `num` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`**.
