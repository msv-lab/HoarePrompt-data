Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number. 

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a number with 'n' digits is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of 'n'. 

In the annotated program:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a non-negative integer `num` as input and converts it to its string representation to facilitate digit extraction.

2. **Length Calculation**: It calculates the length of the number (i.e., the number of digits) which is stored in `num_len`.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The program initializes a variable `sum` to zero. It iterates over each digit in the string representation of the number, converts each digit back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and accumulates this value in `sum`.

4. **Comparison**: Finally, the program checks if the computed `sum` is equal to the original number `num` and returns `True` if they are equal (indicating that `num` is an Armstrong number) or `False` otherwise.

The logic fulfills all the requirements of the problem description. It correctly identifies Armstrong numbers based on the definition, ensuring that all potential cases are handled given that the input is always a non-negative integer. Thus, the implementation is correct.
