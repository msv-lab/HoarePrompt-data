The variable `sum` is assigned the value of `0`. The variables `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, and `sum` is 0.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is 0**.
