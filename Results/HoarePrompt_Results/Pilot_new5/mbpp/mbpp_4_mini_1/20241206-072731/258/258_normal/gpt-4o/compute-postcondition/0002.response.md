The variable `armstrong_sum` is assigned the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is its string representation, and `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, the calculation will yield the `armstrong_sum` based on the digits of `n`.

If `n` is 0, then `num_str` is "0", `num_len` is 1, and `armstrong_sum` will be \(0^1 = 0\). 

If `n` is any other non-negative integer (e.g., 153), `num_str` would be "153", `num_len` would be 3, and the calculation would yield \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\).

The output state must account for all possible scenarios of `n`, `num_str`, and `num_len` while indicating the newly calculated `armstrong_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, and `armstrong_sum` is equal to the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
