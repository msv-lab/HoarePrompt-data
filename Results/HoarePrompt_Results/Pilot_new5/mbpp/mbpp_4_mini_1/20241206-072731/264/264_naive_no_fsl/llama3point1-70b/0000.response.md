Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function `func_1` takes an input in degrees and returns the corresponding value in radians.

All potential edge cases, such as:
- Converting 0 degrees (should return 0 radians),
- Converting 90 degrees (should return \( \frac{\pi}{2} \)),
- Converting 180 degrees (should return \( \pi \)),
- Converting negative angles, and
- Converting angles greater than 360 degrees, 

are handled correctly by this implementation as the mathematical conversion is valid for all real numbers. 

Since I cannot find any input for which the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
