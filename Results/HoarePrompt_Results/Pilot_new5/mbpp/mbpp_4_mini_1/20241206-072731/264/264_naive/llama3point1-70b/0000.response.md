Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * Ï€ / 180`. This formula is accurate and handles all potential input values, including negative angles and zero, correctly producing the expected result for the conversion. Since I cannot identify any cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
