Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to convert degrees to radians. The function `func_1` takes a numeric input parameter `degrees` and applies the formula for conversion from degrees to radians, which is `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. 

The assertions provided in the annotated program test specific degree values (90, 60, and 120) against their expected radian values, confirming that the function behaves as intended for these cases. The use of `math.pi` ensures that the conversion uses a precise value of Ï€, further enhancing the accuracy of the output.

Additionally, while the function does not handle errors related to invalid input types or values, this does not affect the correctness of its implementation of the conversion itself. The problem description does not specify any requirements regarding input validation, so the focus remains on the correct conversion of degrees to radians.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements as outlined in the problem description, and the correctness statement is true.
