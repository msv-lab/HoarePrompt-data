To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and check if it handles all potential edge cases.

### Given Problem Description
The task is to write a function that, given a matrix represented as a list of lists, returns the maximum value of the nth column.

### Provided Program
```python
assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11

def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
```

### Analysis

1. **Column Index Validation**: The program does not handle cases where the index `n` is out of the bounds of the columns in the matrix. For example, if the matrix has only 2 columns (index 0 and 1), and we try to access the 3rd column (index 2) or any index greater than the number of columns, it will raise an `IndexError`.

2. **Empty Matrix Case**: If the matrix is empty (`[]`), the function will attempt to access `row[n]`, resulting in an `IndexError` since there are no rows to access.

3. **Single Row Case**: If the matrix has only one row but two or more columns, the function will still work correctly. However, if the single row does not include the index `n`, it will fail.

4. **Variable Row Lengths**: The program assumes that all rows are of equal length, which may not always be the case. If a row has fewer columns than the specified index `n`, it would again lead to an `IndexError`.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, we can find scenarios where the program does not work correctly:

- If `n` is out of bounds for the given matrix (for example, if `n = 2` for a matrix with only 2 columns).
- If the matrix is empty (`[]`).
- If the rows in the matrix have varying lengths.

Since the program does not handle these cases, it does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
