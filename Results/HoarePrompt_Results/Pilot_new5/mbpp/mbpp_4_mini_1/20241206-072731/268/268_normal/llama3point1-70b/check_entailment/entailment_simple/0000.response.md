Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. The problem description specifies returning the maximum of the n-th column, with the index `n` being a non-negative integer. However, in the program, the code uses `n - 1` when accessing the column. This means that if `n` is 0, it will attempt to access the `-1` index, which is invalid and would raise an `IndexError`. The correct access should be `n` instead of `n - 1`.

2. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the matrix might be empty. Accessing the `n-th` column of an empty list would also raise an `IndexError`.

Thus, there are scenarios (specifically when `n` is 0 or if the matrix is empty) where the function will not function correctly and will raise an error instead of returning a maximum value as expected.
