Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists `matrix` containing numbers and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the n-th column of the matrix. However, if `n` is not within the valid range (0 <= n < number of columns), the code does not handle this case, potentially leading to an IndexError if the input does not conform to the stated conditions. Additionally, if `matrix` is empty, the function will also raise an error since accessing `matrix[0]` will fail.**
