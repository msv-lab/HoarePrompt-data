To analyze the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem description, the implementation, and the output hints.

**Problem description:** The function should receive a matrix (list of lists) and return the maximum value from the `n`-th column of that matrix.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
```

**Potential edge cases:**
1. If the matrix is empty, the program will raise an error when attempting to access the `n`-th column.
2. If `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in any row of the matrix, an `IndexError` will also occur when trying to access `row[n]`.
3. If `n` is negative, the program may not behave as expected because negative indices in Python refer to elements from the end of the list.

**Output hints:** The hints state that the function assumes the matrix is non-empty and that `n` is within the bounds of the number of columns in the matrix. This indicates that the function does not handle cases where `matrix` is empty or `n` is out of bounds, which leads to undefined behavior due to potential exceptions being raised.

Now, let's evaluate if the output hints align with the implementation:

- The hints correctly note that the function is designed to return the maximum value from the `n`-th column of the matrix.
- The assumption that the function will raise errors for out-of-bounds or empty matrices indicates that the implementation does not account for these cases, leading to potential failures.

Since the program does not handle empty matrices or invalid column indices and fails for such cases, this confirms that the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program should include checks to ensure that the matrix is not empty and that `n` is a valid index to avoid raising exceptions. For instance, it should handle cases where `matrix` is empty or where `n` exceeds the number of columns.
