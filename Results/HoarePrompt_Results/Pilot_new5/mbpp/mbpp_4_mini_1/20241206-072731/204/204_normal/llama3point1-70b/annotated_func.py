#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing a month number, where 1 <= n <= 12.
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns True if 'n' is in the list 'months_31_days', which contains the month numbers with 31 days: [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12], otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing a month number (1 to 12) and returns True if `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December); otherwise, it returns False. It does not validate whether `n` is within the range of 1 to 12, which could lead to unintended results if `n` is outside this range.
