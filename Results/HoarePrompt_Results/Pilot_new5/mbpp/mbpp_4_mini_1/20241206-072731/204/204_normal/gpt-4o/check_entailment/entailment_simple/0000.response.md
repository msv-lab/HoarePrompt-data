Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It checks whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) has 31 days. 

In the provided program:

1. A set `months_with_31_days` contains the month numbers that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).
2. The function `func_1` takes an integer `month` as input and checks if it is present in the `months_with_31_days` set.
3. If the month number is in the set, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The assertions test the function with various month numbers, correctly validating the expected output for each case:
- `func_1(5)` returns `True` (May has 31 days).
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (February does not have 31 days).
- `func_1(6)` returns `False` (June does not have 31 days).
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (January has 31 days).
- `func_1(12)` returns `True` (December has 31 days).
- `func_1(11)` returns `False` (November does not have 31 days).

All potential cases are accounted for, and the function adheres to the specified requirements of the problem description. Thus, it is correct.
