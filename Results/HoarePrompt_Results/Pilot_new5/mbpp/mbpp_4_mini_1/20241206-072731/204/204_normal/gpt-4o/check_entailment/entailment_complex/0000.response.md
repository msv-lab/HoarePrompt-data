Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(month)` checks if the provided month number (an integer between 1 and 12) corresponds to a month that has 31 days. 

Here's why it works:

1. The set `months_with_31_days` correctly includes the months with 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).
2. The function returns `True` if the input `month` is found in the set, which aligns perfectly with the problem statement that requires checking if a month has 31 days.
3. The assertions provided in the code validate the function against multiple test cases, confirming that it behaves as expected for months with and without 31 days:
   - `func_1(5)` returns `True` (May has 31 days)
   - `func_1(2)` returns `False` (February does not have 31 days)
   - `func_1(6)` returns `False` (June does not have 31 days)
   - `func_1(1)` returns `True` (January has 31 days)
   - `func_1(12)` returns `True` (December has 31 days)
   - `func_1(11)` returns `False` (November does not have 31 days)

Since the function adheres to the problem description and passes all relevant test cases, it is correct.
