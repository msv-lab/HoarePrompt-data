Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the given month number `n` (which is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 12) corresponds to a month that has 31 days.

Here's why the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Range**: The function is designed to accept an integer `n`, which represents a month number within the valid range of 1 to 12. This is explicitly stated in the annotation before the function call.

2. **Correct Logic**: The program maintains a list named `months_31_days` that contains the month numbers that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

3. **Membership Check**: The expression `n in months_31_days` efficiently checks if `n` is one of the months listed in `months_31_days`. The use of the `in` operator is a direct way to determine membership in a list, which returns `True` if `n` is one of those months and `False` otherwise.

4. **Consistent with Requirements**: The program effectively checks whether the given month number has 31 days, which is precisely what the problem description asks for.

Overall, since the function meets the stated requirements for all valid inputs, it is deemed correct.
