Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case of invalid month numbers. For example, if the input is 0, 13, or any negative number, the function will return `False`, but it should ideally handle these cases by either raising an error or returning a specific value indicating that the input is invalid. Since the program does not meet the requirements for all potential inputs (i.e., it doesn't validate the month number), it is considered incorrect.
