Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge case of invalid month numbers. For example, if the input is `0` or `13`, the function will return `False` because these values are not in the `months_with_31_days` set. However, these inputs are invalid month numbers, and the function does not account for that. The function should ideally check if the month number is within the valid range of `1` to `12` before checking whether it has 31 days or not. Without this validation, the function could give incorrect results for such inputs.
