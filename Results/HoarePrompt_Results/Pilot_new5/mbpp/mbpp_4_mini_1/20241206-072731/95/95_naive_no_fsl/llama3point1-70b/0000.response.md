Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement of counting the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The `str.count()` method used in the function `func_1(s)` accurately counts all non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring within the input string.

I considered potential edge cases, such as:
- An empty string: `func_1("")` would return `0`, which is correct.
- A string without 'std': `func_1("hello")` would also return `0`, which is correct.
- A string with multiple occurrences: `func_1("std std std")` would return `3`, which is correct.
- A string with mixed case: `func_1("Std std STD")` would return `1`, as it is case-sensitive, which is correct per the typical behavior of `str.count()`.

Since the function performs correctly for all these cases, I conclude that the program is correct according to the problem description.
