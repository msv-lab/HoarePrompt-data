Correctness: **False**.

The program does not consider all occurrences of the substring within the main string. For example, in the case of `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python')`, the implementation correctly finds the first occurrence, but it fails to provide the correct output for multiple occurrences. The requirement states that it should find all occurrences and positions, but the code only returns the first one it encounters. 

Additionally, the output for the case where the substring is not found is correct (returning `None`), but the logic for finding multiple occurrences is not implemented, which is a key aspect of the problem description. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements fully, leading to an incorrect result.
