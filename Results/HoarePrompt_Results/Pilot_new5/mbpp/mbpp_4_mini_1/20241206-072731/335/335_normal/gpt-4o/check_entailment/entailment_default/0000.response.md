To assess the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the code along with the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The program is supposed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string. It should return `None` if there is no match.

### Code Analysis
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string`. It uses the `find` method to look for the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`.

1. If `sub_string` is not found (i.e., `find` returns -1), it correctly returns `None`.
2. If found, it calculates the starting position (`start_pos`) and the ending position (`end_pos`) of the substring and returns a tuple of the substring, its starting index, and its ending index.

### Output Hints
The output hints correctly state that the function should return `None` if the `sub_string` is not found and return a tuple with the substring, starting index, and ending index if it is found.

### Edge Cases Considered
1. If `sub_string` is at the beginning of `main_string`, the function should return the correct indices.
2. If `sub_string` is at the end of `main_string`, it should also return the correct indices.
3. If `sub_string` occurs multiple times, the function only finds the first occurrence, which is aligned with the problem description.

### Verification of Examples
The provided assertions in the code:
- `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python')` returns `('python', 0, 6)` — correct.
- `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming')` returns `('programming', 7, 18)` — correct.
- `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language')` returns `('language', 31, 39)` — correct.
- `func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python')` returns `None` — correct.

### Conclusion
The function appears to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. It successfully identifies the first occurrence of the substring, returns the appropriate indices, and handles the case where the substring is not found.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly follows the problem description for all cases provided, and no edge cases have been identified that would lead to incorrect behavior.
