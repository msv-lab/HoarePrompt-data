The function accepts two non-empty strings, `string` and `substring`. It returns None if `substring` is not found within `string`. If `substring` is found, it returns the `substring`, the starting index of `substring` in `string`, and the ending index of the substring within `string`. The function does not handle cases where `substring` appears multiple times in `string`; it only returns the first occurrence.
