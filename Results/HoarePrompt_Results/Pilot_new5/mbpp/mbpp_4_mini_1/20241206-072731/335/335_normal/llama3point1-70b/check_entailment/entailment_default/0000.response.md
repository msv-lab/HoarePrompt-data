The provided program aims to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It returns None if there is no match, and if found, it returns the substring along with its starting and ending indices.

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)
```
1. **Code Logic**: 
   - The function uses `string.find(substring)` to locate the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. 
   - If the `substring` is not found, it returns `None`.
   - If found, it calculates the starting index and the ending index, returning a tuple containing the substring, its starting index, and its ending index.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function only returns the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring appears multiple times, it ignores all but the first occurrence. This behavior diverges from the expectation set by the problem description, which does not specify any such limitation. The expectation is that it should find all occurrences.
   - If the substring appears at the end of the string, it will return the correct ending index, but it would still fail to capture subsequent occurrences, if they exist.

Now, letâ€™s examine the output hints:
- The output hints state that the function "does not handle cases where `substring` appears multiple times in `string`; it only returns the first occurrence." This aligns with our observations that the function lacks the ability to find multiple occurrences of a substring.

Given this analysis, we can conclude:
- The code does not fulfill the entirety of the problem description because it fails to consider the possibility of multiple occurrences of the substring. This is a significant oversight since the problem does not restrict the behavior to just the first occurrence.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not find all occurrences of the substring as required by the problem description, thus not handling all potential cases correctly.
