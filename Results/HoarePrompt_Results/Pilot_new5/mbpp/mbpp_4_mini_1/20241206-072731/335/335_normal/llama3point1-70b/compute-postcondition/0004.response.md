The variable `end` is assigned the value of `start + len(substring)`. Since `substring` is a non-empty string, `len(substring)` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `end` will be greater than or equal to `start + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is an integer representing the index of `substring` in `string`, which is greater than or equal to 0, and `end` is equal to `start + len(substring)`.**
