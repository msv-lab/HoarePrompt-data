Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `n` (using `n % 10`), adds this digit to `total`, and then removes the last digit from `n` (using integer division `n //= 10`). 

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works well for the tested cases:
- For `func_1(345)`, the sum is `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`.
- For `func_1(12)`, the sum is `1 + 2 = 3`.
- For `func_1(97)`, the sum is `9 + 7 = 16`.

Since the function handles non-negative integers appropriately and sums the digits correctly, it meets the requirements of the problem description. No edge cases have been found that would lead to incorrect behavior.
