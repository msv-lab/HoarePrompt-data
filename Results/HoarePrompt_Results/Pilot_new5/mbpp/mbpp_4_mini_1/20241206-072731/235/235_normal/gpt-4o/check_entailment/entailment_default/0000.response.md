To assess the correctness of the provided program, I will first evaluate it against the problem description and then compare it with the output hints.

**Problem description**: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total
```

**Initial Assessment**:
The function `func_1` initializes a variable `total` to 0 and enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained by `n % 10`) to `total`, and then removes that last digit from `n` using integer division (`n //= 10`). The function will return `total`, which represents the sum of the digits of `n`.

**Potential Edge Cases**:
- If `n` is 0, the while loop will not execute (since `n > 0` is false), and `total` will remain 0. The function correctly returns 0 for this case.
- The function should only be used with non-negative integers, as specified in the problem description.

**Output Hints**: 
The output hints state that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It also specifies that if `n` is 0, it returns 0, and for any non-negative integer, it calculates the sum by iterating through each digit.

**Comparison of Output Hints with Code**:
- The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles the case of `n = 0`, returning a sum of 0.
- The function also sums the digits of any other non-negative integer correctly by iterating through each digit.

**Conclusion**:
The function `func_1` adheres to the problem description, handling all specified cases, including edge cases like `n = 0`. There do not appear to be any scenarios where the code would fail to follow the requirements, as it correctly sums the digits of any non-negative integer.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
