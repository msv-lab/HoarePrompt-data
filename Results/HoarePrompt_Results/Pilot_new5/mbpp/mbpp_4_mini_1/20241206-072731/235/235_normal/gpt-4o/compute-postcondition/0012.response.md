The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function returns the total, which is the sum of the digits of the original value of `n`. Additionally, if `n` is 0, the total remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the sum of its digits, ensuring that if `n` is 0, the return value is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a non-negative integer, and returns the sum of the digits of n. If n is 0, it returns 0.**
