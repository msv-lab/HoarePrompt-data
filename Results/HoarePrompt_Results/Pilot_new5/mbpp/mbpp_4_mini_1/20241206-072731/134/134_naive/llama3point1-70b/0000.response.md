Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly computes the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices for a given positive integer `n`. The use of `math.comb(n, i)` correctly calculates the binomial coefficient for the indices from `0` to `n`, and the condition `if i % 2 == 0` ensures that only the even-indexed coefficients are summed. 

For example:
- For `n = 0`, the only coefficient is `C(0, 0) = 1` (even index).
- For `n = 1`, the coefficients are `C(1, 0) = 1` (even index) and `C(1, 1) = 1` (odd index), so the sum is `1`.
- For `n = 2`, the coefficients are `C(2, 0) = 1`, `C(2, 1) = 2`, and `C(2, 2) = 1`. The sum of coefficients at even indices (`0` and `2`) is `1 + 1 = 2`.

The program handles all cases correctly, calculating the desired sum of even index binomial coefficients for any positive integer `n`.
