To analyze the provided program, let's break down the problem description and the given code:

**Problem Description:** 
The task is to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices.

**Provided Program:**
```python
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

**Output Hints:**
The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `2` raised to the power of `(n - 1)`. It does not check for non-positive integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior. However, it primarily computes \(2^{(n-1)}\).

### Initial Assessment of Code vs. Description

1. **Functionality**: The function calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\) when given a positive integer `n`. The output hints also confirm this behavior.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem requires the function to handle only positive integers, which matches the assumption in the output hints. However, the function does not explicitly check if `n` is positive; it assumes this condition is met.
   - If `n` is `1`, the function returns \(2^{(1-1)} = 1\). This could be seen as a valid input, but it does not provide the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices, as required by the problem description.

3. **Calculation of Binomial Coefficients**: The expected functionality of summing binomial coefficients at even indices is not implemented in the code. The result of \(2^{(n-1)}\) does not directly correlate with the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

### Evaluation Against Output Hints

The output hints indicate that the function returns \(2^{(n-1)}\) for any positive integer `n`, which agrees with the provided code. However, they also mention that it does not check for non-positive integers, which is somewhat irrelevant since the problem states `n` is positive.

### Conclusion

The code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which specifically asks for the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The output it provides does not relate to this requirement and hence is incorrect. 

Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case regarding binomial coefficients:

Correctness: **False**.
