Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input. Inside the function, it initializes a variable `sum` to zero and then iterates through all integers from `0` to `n` (inclusive). 

During each iteration, it checks if the index `i` is even (using the condition `if i % 2 == 0`). If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient calculated by `math.comb(n, i)` to the `sum`. This means it effectively sums up all the binomial coefficients where the index is even (0, 2, 4, ..., up to `n` if `n` is even).

After the loop, it returns the accumulated `sum`, which contains the total of the even index binomial coefficients as required by the problem description.

The logic and calculations are correctly applied, and the program will work for any positive integer `n`, thus fulfilling the problem's requirements consistently.
