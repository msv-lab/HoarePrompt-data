Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Specification**: The function `func_1` takes a single positive integer parameter `n`, which aligns with the requirement that it takes a positive integer.

2. **Logic for Sum of Even Index Binomial Coefficients**: 
   - The loop iterates through all integers `i` from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is even using the condition `if i % 2 == 0`.
   - If `i` is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient using `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the `sum` variable.

3. **Correct Calculation of Even Indices**: The binomial coefficients are computed for all even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., up to `n` if `n` is even, or `n-1` if `n` is odd). This matches the requirement to sum the even index binomial coefficients.

4. **Final Output**: After the loop completes, the function returns the total computed sum, which corresponds to the sum of all even index binomial coefficients from `0` to `n`.

Overall, the function adheres strictly to the problem description by implementing the correct logic to compute the required sum of even index binomial coefficients. Therefore, the program is correct.
