#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1). It assumes that `n` is always positive, so there are no checks for non-positive integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `n` is less than 1 (e.g., it will return 1 when `n` is 1 and returns a fractional value for any non-positive input). However, the primary functionality remains to compute \(2^{(n-1)}\).
