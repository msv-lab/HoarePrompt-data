Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

However, the function `func_1(n)` simply returns `2 ** (n - 1)`. This calculation does not correspond to the sum of even index binomial coefficients, which can be derived from the binomial theorem and is given by the sum of coefficients for even indices in the expansion of \((1 + 1)^n\).

To clarify with an example:

- For \( n = 4 \), the binomial coefficients are \([1, 4, 6, 4, 1]\). The even index coefficients are \([1, 6, 1]\) and their sum is \(1 + 6 + 1 = 8\). The function returns \(2^{(4 - 1)} = 8\), which matches this case but does not prove correctness for all cases.

- For \( n = 6 \), the binomial coefficients are \([1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1]\). The even index coefficients are \([1, 15, 15, 1]\) and their sum is \(1 + 15 + 15 + 1 = 32\). The function returns \(2^{(6 - 1)} = 32\), which matches this case but again does not confirm correctness universally.

The function does not explicitly compute the binomial coefficients nor does it sum only the even indexed coefficients, making its behavior inconsistent with the problem description. Thus, the program fails to properly implement the required functionality as stated.
