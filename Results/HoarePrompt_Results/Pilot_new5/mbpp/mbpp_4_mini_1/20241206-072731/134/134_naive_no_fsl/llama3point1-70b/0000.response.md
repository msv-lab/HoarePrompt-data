To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the implementation.

**Problem description:** The function should take a positive integer `n` and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

**Program Implementation:**
```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
    return sum
```

### Analysis:
- The function uses a loop that iterates from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
- For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`).
- If `i` is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the `sum`.
- Finally, it returns the total `sum` of the even index binomial coefficients.

### Verification of correctness:
1. **Understanding Binomial Coefficients:** The binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` gives the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements. The even index binomial coefficients would be those where `k` is even, such as `C(n, 0)`, `C(n, 2)`, `C(n, 4)`, etc.
  
2. **Checking Edge Cases:** 
   - For `n = 1`, the even index coefficients would be `C(1, 0) = 1`. The program should return `1`.
   - For `n = 2`, the even index coefficients are `C(2, 0) = 1` and `C(2, 2) = 1`. The program should return `2`.
   - For `n = 3`, the even index coefficients are `C(3, 0) = 1` and `C(3, 2) = 3`. The program should return `4`.
   - For `n = 4`, the even index coefficients are `C(4, 0) = 1`, `C(4, 2) = 6`, and `C(4, 4) = 1`. The program should return `8`.

Through testing these edge cases, the function seems to correctly identify and sum the even index binomial coefficients.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly computes the sum of even index binomial coefficients for the provided cases and follows the problem description as required, I cannot find a case where it fails. Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The function works as intended for all tested cases, which are representative of the problem statement.
