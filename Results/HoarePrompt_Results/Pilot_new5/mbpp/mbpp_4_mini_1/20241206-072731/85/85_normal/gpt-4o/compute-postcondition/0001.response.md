`max_val` is assigned the value of the maximum integer in the list `arr`. The value of `min_val` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of `min_val` and the new value of `max_val`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer from `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum integer from `arr`.**
