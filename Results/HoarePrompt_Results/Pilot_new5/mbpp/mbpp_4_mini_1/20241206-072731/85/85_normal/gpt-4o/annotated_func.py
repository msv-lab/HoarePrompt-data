#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum integers from the list 'arr', which is equal to max_val - min_val
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list. If the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` due to the `min()` and `max()` functions being called on an empty sequence, which is a potential edge case not covered in the annotations.
