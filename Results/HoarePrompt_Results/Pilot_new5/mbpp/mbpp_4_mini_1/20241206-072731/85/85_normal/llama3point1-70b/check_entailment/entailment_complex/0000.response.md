Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it does calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, it fails to handle the edge case where the input list `arr` is empty. In such a case, calling `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` will raise a `ValueError`, which means the program does not provide a valid output for all potential cases. 

The problem description requires a function that reliably finds the maximum difference between any two elements, implying it should handle all input scenarios, including an empty list. Since the program does not address this scenario, it does not satisfy the problem description completely.
