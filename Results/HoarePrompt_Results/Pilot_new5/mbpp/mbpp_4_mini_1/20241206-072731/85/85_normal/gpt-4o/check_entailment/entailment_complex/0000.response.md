Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description requirements because it does not handle the case where the input array is empty. As noted in the annotations, calling `min()` and `max()` on an empty sequence will raise a `ValueError`. The problem description requires finding the maximum difference between any two elements in the array; however, if the array is empty, there are no elements to compare, and thus the function will not work correctly.

Additionally, the program assumes that the input will always contain at least two elements to calculate a maximum difference, which is not guaranteed based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is incomplete and incorrect for all potential cases, especially when considering edge cases like an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements.
