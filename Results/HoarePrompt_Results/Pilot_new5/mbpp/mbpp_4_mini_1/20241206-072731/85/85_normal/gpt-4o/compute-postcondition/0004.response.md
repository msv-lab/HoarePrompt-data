The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function calculates the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list `arr`, which is represented as `max_val - min_val`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum integers in that list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers, and returns the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list.**
