Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It does so by identifying the minimum and maximum values in the array and then calculating the difference between these two values. 

The assertions provided as tests cover a few different scenarios:
1. For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`, which is correct.
2. For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`, which is also correct.
3. For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`, which is again correct.

The function handles typical cases as well as edge cases naturally:
- If the input consists of two elements, it will still return the correct maximum difference.
- The function will raise a `ValueError` if the input is empty, which is appropriate behavior given that there would be no elements to compare.

In summary, the function correctly adheres to the problem description for all tested cases and potential scenarios.
