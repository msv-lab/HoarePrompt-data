To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the function `func_1` against the problem description, which states that the function should find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible.

Checking the implementation of `func_1`:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by checking if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns `0`, which is correct.
2. **Sorting**: The function sorts the input list, which is necessary for the dynamic programming approach used later.
3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: An array `dp` is initialized where each position `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest subset ending with `nums[i]`. Initially, each subset contains at least one element (itself), so `dp` is initialized to `[1] * len(nums)`.
4. **Nested Loop Logic**: The outer loop iterates over each number and the inner loop checks all previous numbers to see if they are divisors of the current number. If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, it means `nums[i]` can be added to the subset that ends with `nums[j]`, and `dp[i]` is updated accordingly.
5. **Max Calculation**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which indicates the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

Now, let's examine potential edge cases:

- Consider the input list `nums = [2, 4, 8, 16]`. The largest subset here is the entire list, where every pair is divisible. The expected output is `4`, which matches the function's output.
- Now consider another input list `nums = [1, 2, 3]`. The largest subset here is `[1, 2]` or `[1, 3]`, both of which yield pairs that are divisible. The expected output is `2`, which should also match the function's output.
  
However, we need to test with lists that may include numbers not divisible by each other:

- Input: `nums = [2, 3, 5]`. The only valid subsets here are the single elements, so the expected output should be `1`. The current implementation would return `1`, which is correct.
- Input: `nums = [6, 3, 2, 4, 12]`. The largest subset is `[2, 4, 12]`, and the expected output is `3`.

Now let's check a problematic case:

- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]`. The expected output is `6` since all pairs are divisible by `1`. However, the implementation will only check pairs from the second position onwards, and thus might overlook the divisibility of `1` with all other numbers.

This reveals a flaw in the implementation because it does not account for the element `1` being a universal divisor for any number in the set. Therefore, the implementation could yield an incorrect result for this case.

Thus, since we have found an edge case where the algorithm does not meet the requirements of the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
