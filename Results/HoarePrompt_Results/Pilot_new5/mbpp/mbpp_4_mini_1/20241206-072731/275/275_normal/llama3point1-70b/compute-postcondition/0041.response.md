Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list where each entry `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of divisible subsequences ending with `nums[i]`, calculated based on the divisibility conditions applied throughout the loop. If `nums` has `n` elements, then `dp` reflects the longest divisible subsequence for each element in `nums`, starting from `1` for all elements and updated accordingly.**
