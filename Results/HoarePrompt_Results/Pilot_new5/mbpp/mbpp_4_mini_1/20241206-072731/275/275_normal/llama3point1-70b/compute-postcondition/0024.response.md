Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of 1's that may have changed at index `i`, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp` may have been updated at index `i` when considering `j` as a valid divisor.***
