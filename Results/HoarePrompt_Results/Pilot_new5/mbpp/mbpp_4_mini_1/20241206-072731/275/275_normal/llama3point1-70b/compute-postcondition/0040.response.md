Initial State: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `dp` is a list representing the maximum length of divisible subsequences, `i` is 2.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` where `i` is 2 and `j` is 0.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` where `i` is 2 and `j` is 1.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements. `dp[2]` is the maximum of the previous value of `dp[2]` and the values of `dp[0] + 1` and `dp[1] + 1` if `nums[2]` is divisible by `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` respectively.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `dp[2]` holds the maximum length of divisible subsequences that can be formed with the integer at index `2` in `nums`. If no divisible pairs were found, `dp[2]` remains unchanged from its initial value.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` now represents the maximum length of divisible subsequences ending with `nums[i]`, specifically `dp[2]` is the updated value based on the divisibility conditions checked against `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.**
