The loop iterates through the indices of the list `nums` up to `i-1`, checking if the current element `nums[i]` is divisible by any of the previous elements. The state of the variable `dp` will reflect the longest divisible subset ending at index `i`. 

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following must hold true:

- `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element.
- `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`.
- `i` will reflect the total number of iterations that have been completed, which will be equal to the length of `nums` (let's denote it as `n`).
- Each `dp[i]` will contain the length of the longest divisible subset that includes the element `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`.**
