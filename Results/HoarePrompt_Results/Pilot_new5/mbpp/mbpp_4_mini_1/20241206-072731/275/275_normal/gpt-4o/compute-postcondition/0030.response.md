According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The variable `j` will iterate from 0 to `i - 1`, so for the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1. Given that `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `nums` has at least one element, `i` will be 1 or greater. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once.

At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 0 during the first iteration. Additionally, the variables `nums` and `dp` do not need to change for the loop to execute, as they are already in the appropriate state. 

Thus, the adjusted state before the loop execution would be:
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 0**
