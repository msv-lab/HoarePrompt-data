According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is less than `i`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than 2. The previous state indicates that `j` was 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1, which is still less than `i` (2). 

Since `j` will now be 1, the loop can execute again. The `nums` list remains sorted and has at least 3 elements, and we need to ensure that the conditions regarding divisibility are maintained for the new `j`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
