According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `i`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `i`. In the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0. Since `j` is currently 0, it can still execute for the next value of `j`.

After the last iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `i`, which is still valid because `i` is 2.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1's, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
