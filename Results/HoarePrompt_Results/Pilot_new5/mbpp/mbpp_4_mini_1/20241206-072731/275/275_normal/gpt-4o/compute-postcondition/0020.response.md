The code updates the `dp[i]` value by taking the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, this indicates that the longest divisible subset can be extended by including `nums[i]`. 

1. `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. 
2. `dp[j] + 1` represents extending the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[j]` by adding `nums[i]`.

The values of `nums`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `dp[i]` is updated based on the relationship with `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the updated lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is greater than 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
