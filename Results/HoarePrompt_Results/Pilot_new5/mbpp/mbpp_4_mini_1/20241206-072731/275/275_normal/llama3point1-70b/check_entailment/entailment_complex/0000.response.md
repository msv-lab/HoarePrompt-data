Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it correctly returns `0`, indicating that there are no subsets in an empty list.

2. **Sorting**: The list `nums` is sorted. This is important because, in a sorted list, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` (with `i > j`), then all preceding numbers `nums[k]` (where `k < j`) must also divide `nums[i]`. Sorting simplifies the divisibility checks.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses a dynamic programming array `dp` to keep track of the maximum length of divisible subsequences. The entry `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of a subset ending with the `i`-th element. The nested loop iterates through all earlier elements to check divisibility, updating `dp[i]` appropriately.

4. **Final Output**: The maximum value in the `dp` list is returned, which correctly represents the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible.

The logic implemented in the program effectively adheres to the requirements in the problem description by ensuring that it considers all potential pairs and correctly identifies the largest subset of elements that meet the divisibility condition. Thus, it fulfills the task as specified.
