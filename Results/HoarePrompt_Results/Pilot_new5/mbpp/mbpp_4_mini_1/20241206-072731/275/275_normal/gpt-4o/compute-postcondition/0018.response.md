According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The `for` loop iterates over the range defined by `i`. Since `i` is currently 0, the range `range(i)` will be empty, meaning the loop will not execute at all. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. There are no specific requirements for `nums` or `dp` to affect the execution of this loop since this loop only depends on `i`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0**
