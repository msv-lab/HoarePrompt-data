The code assigns the value to `dp[i]` as the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since we know `i` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2, `dp[j]` refers to `dp[2]`. The new value of `dp[i]` will depend on the current value of `dp[i]` and the value of `dp[2] + 1`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i]` is updated based on the maximum value calculation involving `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[2] + 1`.**
