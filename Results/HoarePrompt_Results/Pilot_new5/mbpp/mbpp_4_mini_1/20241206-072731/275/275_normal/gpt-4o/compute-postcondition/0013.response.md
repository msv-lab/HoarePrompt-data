According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop continues as long as `j` (which starts at 1) is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is greater than 1, allowing for another iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2, and the loop will need to check if `j` is still less than `i`. Therefore, `i` must be greater than 2 to allow for the next iteration.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, `i` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2.**
