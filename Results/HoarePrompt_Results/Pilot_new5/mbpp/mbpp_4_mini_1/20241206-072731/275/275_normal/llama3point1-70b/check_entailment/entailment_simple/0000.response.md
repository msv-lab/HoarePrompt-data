Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Handling Empty Lists**: The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it correctly returns 0, as there can be no subsets in an empty list.

3. **Sorting**: The function sorts the list `nums`, ensuring that when checking pairs of numbers, we can efficiently build potential divisible subsets by iterating through the sorted list.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the longest divisible subsequences. The variable `dp[i]` holds the length of the longest subset that ends with `nums[i]`. The inner loop checks all previous elements to see if they are divisors of `nums[i]` and updates `dp[i]` accordingly.

5. **Final Computation**: After processing all elements, the function returns the maximum value found in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset where each pair of numbers is divisible.

Overall, the program systematically constructs the solution by leveraging sorting and dynamic programming, ensuring that it meets the problem description's requirements for all potential cases.
