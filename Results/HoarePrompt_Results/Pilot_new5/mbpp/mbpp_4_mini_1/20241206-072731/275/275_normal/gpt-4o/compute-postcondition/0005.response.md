According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop will execute as long as `len(nums)` is at least 1. Given that `dp` is a list with a length equal to `nums`, it will also have the same length. 

Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, as that is the starting value for the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the conditions are that `nums` must be a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, `i` is 0**
