Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list representing the maximum length of divisible subsequences based on the divisibility conditions applied throughout the loop. Each entry in `dp` corresponds to the length of the longest divisible subsequence that ends with the respective number in `nums`.**
