According to the code, the loop iterates starting from index 1 up to `len(nums) - 1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at 1 and `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, meaning `len(nums)` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2, and `len(nums)` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `dp` is a list representing the maximum length of divisible subsequences, `i` is 2**
