Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
