According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates `j` from 0 to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `i`. Since we know that `j` is currently 0, in the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must remain greater than `j`, which after the increment will require `i` to be greater than 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, `i` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1**
