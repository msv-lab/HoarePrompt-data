Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find shared elements between two lists (`list1` and `list2`), which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

2. **Set Intersection**: The function converts both lists to sets and then computes their intersection using the `&` operator. This effectively finds all the elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`. 

3. **Return Value**: The result is converted back to a tuple that contains the shared elements, and it is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the output is consistent and meets expectations.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided check the function against various test cases, which confirm that the output is correct for the given input scenarios.

In conclusion, the function correctly identifies and returns the shared elements from the two lists as specified in the problem description. Thus, it fulfills the requirements consistently for all potential cases.
