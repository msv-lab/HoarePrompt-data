The code provided is designed to find the shared (common) elements from two lists and return them as a sorted tuple. Here's a breakdown of the assessment:

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The function `func_1` converts both input lists into sets and finds the intersection (common elements) using the `&` operator. It then sorts these common elements and returns them as a tuple.
   - The function should work correctly for most cases where both lists have elements in common.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If either of the input lists is empty, the function will return an empty tuple `()` since there are no common elements to find or sort.
   - If both lists have no elements in common, it will also return an empty tuple.
   - The function appears to handle different data types within the lists, as the set intersection and sorting functions in Python can handle this gracefully.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints state that the function does not handle the case where either list is empty and will return an empty tuple in such cases. This is an accurate description of the behavior of the function since it aligns with how set operations work in Python. 
   - The hints also mention that the function correctly accounts for elements of any data type present in the lists, which is also true.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The code does follow the problem description in the cases provided and works as expected for those cases. However, the output hints indicate a limitation in handling empty lists, which should have been addressed in the problem description.

Given the information, while the function does what is expected for non-empty lists, it does not explicitly handle the scenario where one or both lists are empty. 

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function does not handle the case where either list is empty. While it returns an empty tuple in such a scenario, it does not explicitly state how it behaves in the problem description or address this edge case, which is necessary to consider it correct.
