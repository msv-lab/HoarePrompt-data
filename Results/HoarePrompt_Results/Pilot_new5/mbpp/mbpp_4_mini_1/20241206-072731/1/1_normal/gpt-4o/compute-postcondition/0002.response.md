The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists that may contain any data types. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`. The common elements are identified using a set. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists and return a tuple of the sorted common elements between those lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a tuple of the sorted common elements found in both lists.**
