The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are lists. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the intersection of the elements from the lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and return a tuple that includes the common elements from both lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, test_tup1 and test_tup2, and returns a tuple containing the intersection of the elements from the two lists.**
