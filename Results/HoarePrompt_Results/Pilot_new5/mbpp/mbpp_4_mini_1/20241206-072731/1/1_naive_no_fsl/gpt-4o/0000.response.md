To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and compare it against the problem description.

The problem description requires us to find the shared elements from two given lists.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the function:

1. The function converts the input lists into sets (`set(list1)` and `set(list2)`).
2. It finds the intersection of these two sets using the `&` operator, which yields the common elements.
3. The common elements are then sorted and converted back into a tuple.
4. Finally, the function returns this tuple of sorted common elements.

The provided assertions are:

- `assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)`
- `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)`
- `assert func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)`

### Analysis of Assertions:
- For the first assertion, the common elements between `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)` are `4` and `5`, which is correctly returned as `(4, 5)`.
- For the second assertion, the common elements between `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 4, 3, 7)` are `3` and `4`, which is correctly returned as `(3, 4)`.
- For the third assertion, the common elements between `(11, 12, 14, 13)` and `(17, 15, 14, 13)` are `13` and `14`, which is correctly returned as `(13, 14)`.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider some potential edge cases:
1. If both lists are empty: `func_1((), ())` should return an empty tuple `()`.
2. If one list is empty: `func_1((1, 2, 3), ())` should return an empty tuple `()`.
3. If there are no common elements: `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` should return an empty tuple `()`.
4. If there are duplicate elements: `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), (2, 3, 3, 4))` should return `(2, 3)` because duplicates do not affect the set intersection.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- Checking `func_1((), ())` returns `()`, which matches expectations.
- Checking `func_1((1, 2, 3), ())` returns `()`, which matches expectations.
- Checking `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` returns `()`, which matches expectations.
- Checking `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), (2, 3, 3, 4))` returns `(2, 3)`, which matches expectations.

Since the function handles all the cases correctly as per the problem description and the additional edge cases we examined, we can confidently conclude that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
