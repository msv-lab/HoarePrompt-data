Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement of finding shared elements from two given lists. The function `func_1` takes two inputs, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, converts them to sets, and then computes the intersection of these sets using the `&` operator. Finally, it returns the result as a tuple.

Here's a brief analysis of potential edge cases:

1. **Empty Lists**: If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty tuple, which is the expected output.
   ```python
   func_1([], [])  # returns ()
   ```

2. **No Common Elements**: If there are no shared elements, the function will return an empty tuple.
   ```python
   func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])  # returns ()
   ```

3. **Identical Lists**: If both input lists are identical, the function will return a tuple containing all the elements of the lists.
   ```python
   func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])  # returns (1, 2, 3)
   ```

4. **Different Data Types**: The function handles elements of different data types since sets can contain mixed types, as long as they are hashable.
   ```python
   func_1([1, 'a', 3.0], ['a', 4, 1])  # returns (1, 'a')
   ```

5. **Duplicated Elements**: Since sets automatically handle duplicates, the function will return the unique intersection of both lists.
   ```python
   func_1([1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 4])  # returns (2,)
   ```

Since the function handles all of these edge cases correctly and meets the problem's requirements for finding shared elements from two lists, I conclude that the implementation is correct.

Thus, the final output is:

Correctness: **True**
