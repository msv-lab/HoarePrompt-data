Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `array`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which can be of any type. This aligns with the problem requirement to accept an array and an element.

2. **Finding the Index**: The program uses the `index()` method of the list to find the position of `element` in `array`. If the `element` is found, it returns a tuple of `True` and the index. This behavior matches the requirement to return a tuple containing a boolean indicating the presence of the element and its index.

3. **Handling Absence of Element**: If the `element` is not present in the `array`, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError`. The program correctly handles this exception and returns `False` and `-1`. This adheres to the requirement to return `-1` if the element is not found.

4. **Return Value**: The return types match what is specified in the problem descriptionâ€”returning a tuple with a boolean and an integer index or `-1`.

5. **Robustness**: The function handles any type of variable for `element` and correctly processes a variety of list contents without any assumptions about the type or structure of the list.

Since all aspects of the program conform to the stated requirements of the problem description and handle all potential cases, the program is considered correct.
