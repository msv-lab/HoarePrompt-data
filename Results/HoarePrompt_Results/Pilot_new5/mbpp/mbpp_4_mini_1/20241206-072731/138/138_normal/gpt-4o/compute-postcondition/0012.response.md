The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. The parameter `arr` is a list of elements, and `element` can be of any data type. After executing the function body, the function checks for the presence of `element` in `arr`. 

- In Case_1, if `element` is found at index 0, the function returns `True` and the index 0.
- In Case_2, if `element` is found at index 1, the function returns `True` and the index 1.
- In Case_3, if `element` is found at index 2, the function returns `True` and the index 2.
- In Case_4, if `element` is not found in the list `arr`, the function returns `False` and -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, check for the first occurrence of the `element` in the list, and return whether it was found along with its index or return an indication that it was not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of elements, and a parameter `element` of any data type. It returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` if found, or returns `False` and -1 if `element` is not found in the list.**
