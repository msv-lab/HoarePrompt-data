To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the program's logic and verify if it meets the specified requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
The function must:
1. Take in an array and an element.
2. Return a tuple containing:
   - A boolean indicating if the element is in the array.
   - The index position of the element, or -1 if the element is not found.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. The function `func_1(arr, element)` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of elements, and `element`, the value being searched for.
2. It uses a `for` loop combined with `enumerate` to iterate through the array.
3. If the `value` in the array matches the `element`, it returns a tuple `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the matched element.
4. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns the tuple `(False, -1)`.

### Test Cases:
- All assertions in the annotated program check for correctness:
  - `assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)` checks if 31 is found at index 3.
  - `assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)` checks if 61 is found at index 7.
  - `assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)` checks if 48 is found at index 6.
  
The assertions expect the function to return the correct boolean and index, which the program does.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The function correctly identifies if the element is present in the array and returns the appropriate index or -1 when the element is not found.
- The program handles the case where the element is present (returning `True` and the correct index) and the case where it is absent (returning `False` and -1).

### Conclusion:
Since the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases effectively, the correctness of the program is validated.

Correctness: **True**
