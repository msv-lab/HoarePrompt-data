Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should multiply all the numbers in a list and divide by the length of the list. If the list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0, resulting in a division by zero error. Thus, the function does not perform correctly for this potential case.
