The value of `product` is multiplied by `num`. Given that `product` is initially 1 and `num` is the first number in the list of `numbers`, the new value of `product` will be equal to `1 * num`, resulting in `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state remains valid for them.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is the first number in the list**.
