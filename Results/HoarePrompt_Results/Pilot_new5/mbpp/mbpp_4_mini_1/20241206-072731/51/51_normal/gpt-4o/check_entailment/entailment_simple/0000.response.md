Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Multiplication of All Numbers**: The function `func_1(numbers)` correctly initializes a variable `product` to 1. It then iterates through each number in the input list `numbers`, multiplying each number to the `product`. At the end of the loop, `product` contains the product of all numbers in the list.

2. **Division by Length of the List**: After calculating the product of all numbers, the function divides this product by the length of the list using `len(numbers)`. This operation is performed correctly since the length is always greater than zero (as stated in the assertion that `numbers` is a non-empty list).

3. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns the result of the division, fulfilling the requirement to return the product of all numbers divided by the length of the list.

The assertions provided in the annotated program verify the correctness of the function for multiple test cases, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for various inputs. Each assertion checks that the output of the function matches the expected result within a specified relative tolerance, indicating that the function handles the calculations correctly.

Thus, the program adheres strictly to the problem description and does what is required for all potential cases.
