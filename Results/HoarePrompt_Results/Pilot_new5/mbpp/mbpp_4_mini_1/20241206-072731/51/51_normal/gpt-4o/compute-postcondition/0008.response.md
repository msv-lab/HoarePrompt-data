`result` is assigned the value of `product / len(numbers)`. Given that `product` is the product of all numbers in the non-empty list `numbers`, `len(numbers)` gives the count of elements in that list. Therefore, `result` will be equal to the average of the numbers in the list, calculated as the total product divided by the number of elements. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`product` is equal to the product of all numbers in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `result` is equal to `product / len(numbers)`**.
