The code provided implements a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and divides the result by the length of the list. 

Looking at the code:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

**Initial Assessment**:
- The function calculates the product of all numbers in the list.
- It returns this product divided by the length of the list.
- The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty. If `numbers` is an empty list, `len(numbers)` will be `0`, leading to a division by zero error.
- If the list contains a zero, the product will be `0`, and the function will return `0`, which is correct according to the problem description.

**Output Hints**:
- The hints state that the function returns the product divided by the length, and confirms that if there is a zero in the list, the function will return zero.
- It also mentions that the function does not handle empty lists or lists containing only zeros gracefully.

After reviewing the above points, we can conclude:
- The function does not handle the edge case of an empty list. This is a potential case where the program does not work correctly, as it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
  
Thus, the hints are consistent with the code in identifying that the function is not robust in handling all potential input cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the edge case of an empty list. If the list is empty, a division by zero will occur, which is not addressed in the problem description.
