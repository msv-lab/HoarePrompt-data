The value of `S_next` is updated to be `2 * S1 + S0`. Given that `S1` is 3 and `S0` is 1, we can calculate `S_next` as follows:

```
S_next = 2 * 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7
```

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
