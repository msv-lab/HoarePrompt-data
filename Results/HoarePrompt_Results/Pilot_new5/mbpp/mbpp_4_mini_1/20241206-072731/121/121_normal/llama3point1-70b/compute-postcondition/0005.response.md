The variable `num` is assigned the value `7`. The variables `n` and `count` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. The state of `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1, and `count` is still 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`; `count` is 1; `num` is 7**
