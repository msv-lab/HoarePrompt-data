The provided problem description requires a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, upon analyzing the annotated program, it becomes clear that the function `func_1` does not compute the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. 

1. **Behavior of `func_1`:**
   - The function returns `1` if `n` is `0` or `1`.
   - For values of `n` greater than `1`, it computes a sequence based on a recurrence relation, specifically:
     - `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`
   - This does not correspond to the definition of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers.

2. **Assertions:**
   - The assertions check for values that are expected to correspond to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th terms of the sequence computed by `func_1`. However, these values are not the actual Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. For example, the 3rd prime in this sequence is `7`, the 4th is `17`, and the 5th is `41`. However, the function does not define or calculate prime numbers based on the definition of the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The function does not fulfill the requirement of finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, as it instead calculates a different numerical sequence.
   - Therefore, it does not meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
