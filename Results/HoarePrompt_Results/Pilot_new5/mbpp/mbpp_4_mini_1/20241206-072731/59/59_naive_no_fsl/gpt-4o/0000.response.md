Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly merges three lists and sorts the combined result. The function takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted()` function. 

The assertions provided in the program are all valid test cases that demonstrate the function's ability to handle various scenarios, including duplicates, different sizes of lists, and negative values. Each assertion checks whether the output is as expected, and they all return correct results.

Since no potential edge cases or examples were found where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct. Thus, the output is True.
