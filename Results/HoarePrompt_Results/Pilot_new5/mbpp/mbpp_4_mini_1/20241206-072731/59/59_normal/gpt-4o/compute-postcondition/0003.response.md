The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. All three parameters are lists of integers. After executing the function body, it returns `sorted_list`, which is a sorted version of the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers and return a sorted list that contains all the integers from these three lists concatenated together.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted version of the concatenation of these lists.**
