The provided code for merging three lists into a single sorted list appears to function as intended based on the problem description. The function `func_1` concatenates the three input lists and sorts the combined list before returning it.

However, there are potential edge cases that the code does not handle:

1. **Empty Lists**: If any of the input lists are empty, the function will still return a sorted list. This is expected behavior; however, the output hints mention that the function does not handle potential edge cases. An empty list should return an empty list, which is correctly handled in the implementation.

2. **Non-integer Values**: The output hints indicate that the function does not handle lists containing non-integer values. The code does not include any checks for the data type of the elements within the lists, which means if non-integer values are included, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors during sorting.

Given these considerations, while the code appears to work correctly for the provided test cases (which consist of integer lists), it does not explicitly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, it overlooks the possibility of non-integer values in the input lists.

Thus, while the function may work in many scenarios, it does not completely adhere to the problem description because it lacks necessary validation checks for its inputs. 

Correctness: **False**.
