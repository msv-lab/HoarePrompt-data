Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not handle cases where the input lists may contain elements that are not comparable. If any of the lists contain elements of different types that cannot be compared (for example, a string and an integer), it will raise a `TypeError` during the sorting process. Since the problem description does not specify that the input lists will only contain comparable elements, the program's lack of error handling for non-comparable elements means it cannot be considered correct in all potential cases.
