Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement described in the problem statement, which is to calculate the angle (or phase) of a complex number formed by its real and imaginary parts. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are expected to be floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: Inside the function, it creates a complex number using `complex(real, imag)`, which combines the real and imaginary parts correctly.

3. **Phase Calculation**: The function uses `cmath.phase(complex_number)` to compute the phase (angle) of the complex number. The `cmath.phase` function is designed for this exact purpose, returning the angle in radians.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test the function against known values for specific inputs, confirming that it behaves correctly for those cases. The angle of the complex number is computed accurately, and the results are checked against expected values using `math.isclose` to account for potential floating-point inaccuracies.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program notes that there are no missing edge cases, suggesting it handles all scenarios (including positive and negative values for both real and imaginary parts, zero values, and complex numbers in all quadrants).

Therefore, since the function consistently meets the requirements of returning the angle of a complex number, it fulfills the problem description accurately.
