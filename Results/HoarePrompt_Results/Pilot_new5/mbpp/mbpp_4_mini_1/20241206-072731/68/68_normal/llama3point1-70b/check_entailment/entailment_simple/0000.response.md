Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function to compute the angle (or phase) of a complex number. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: The line `complex_num = complex(real, imag)` correctly constructs a complex number from the provided real and imaginary parts. This is essential for calculating the angle of the complex number.

3. **Angle Calculation**: The function uses `cmath.phase(complex_num)` to compute the angle (also known as the phase) of the complex number. The `cmath.phase` function is specifically designed for this purpose, ensuring that the calculation is accurate and adheres to mathematical principles.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed angle, which fulfills the requirement of the problem description.

Overall, the program effectively and correctly implements the task as described in the problem statement, handling any valid floating-point inputs for `real` and `imag`.
