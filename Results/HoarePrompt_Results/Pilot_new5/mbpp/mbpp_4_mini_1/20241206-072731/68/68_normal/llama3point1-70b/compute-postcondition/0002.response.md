The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. After executing the function body, the function returns the phase of the complex number created from these floating-point numbers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, and return the phase of the complex number formed by these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters real and imag, and returns the phase of the complex number created from them.**
