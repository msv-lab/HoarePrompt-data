To assess the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem description, the program, and the output hints.

**Problem description:** The task is to write a function that returns the angle (phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary components.

**Program:**
```python
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number formed by these two components. There are no missing edge cases or errors present in the function as it correctly calculates the phase of the complex number regardless of the values of `real` and `imag`.

**Analysis:**

1. **Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - The function constructs a complex number from the `real` and `imag` inputs using `complex(real, imag)`.
   - It then calculates the phase of this complex number using `cmath.phase()`.
   - The phase of a complex number is defined correctly in mathematics and should provide the angle in radians.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The phase function should handle various scenarios, including:
     - Both `real` and `imag` being zero, which is mathematically ambiguous (the angle is undefined).
     - When `real` is zero and `imag` is positive or negative (angles of π/2 or -π/2).
     - When `real` is negative (angles should be in the second or third quadrants depending on the sign of `imag`).

3. **Output hints:**
   - The output hints state that there are no missing edge cases or errors. However, the assertion checks for specific values suggest that certain cases were anticipated (like complex numbers with zero real or imaginary parts).

**Potential Issue:**
- The program does not handle the case when both `real` and `imag` are zero, which should ideally be checked to avoid returning an ambiguous result (undefined angle).
  
Since the output hints suggest there are no errors or missing edge cases, but the program does not account for the case when both inputs are zero, it is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
The function does not meet the problem description for all potential cases, as it will fail (or provide an incorrect result) when both `real` and `imag` are zero.

Correctness: **False**.
