The variable `complex_num` is assigned the value of a complex number created from the floating-point numbers `real` and `imag`. The output state will reflect this new variable while maintaining the existing values of `real` and `imag`. 

Output State: **`real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_num` is equal to complex(real, imag)**
