The variable `complex_number` is assigned the value of the complex number created from the `real` and `imag` floating-point numbers using the `complex()` function. The values of `real` and `imag` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_number` is equal to `complex(real, imag)`.

Output State: **`real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_number` is equal to `complex(real, imag)`**.
