#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number formed by the real part `real` and the imaginary part `imag`, represented by `complex_number`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number formed by these two components. There are no missing edge cases or errors present in the function as it correctly calculates the phase of the complex number regardless of the values of `real` and `imag`.
