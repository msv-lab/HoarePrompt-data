The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. All three parameters are positive real numbers representing the base, height, and length of a triangular prism, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is calculated as \((b \times h \div 2) \times l\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive real numbers `b`, `h`, and `l`, and return the volume of a triangular prism based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters b, h, and l which are positive real numbers, and returns the volume of a triangular prism calculated as (b * h / 2) * l.**
