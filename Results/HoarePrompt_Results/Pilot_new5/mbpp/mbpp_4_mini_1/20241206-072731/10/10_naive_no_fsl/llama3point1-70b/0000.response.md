To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether the function `func_1(b, h, l)` accurately computes the volume of a triangular prism based on the given parameters: `b` (base of the triangle), `h` (height of the triangle), and `l` (length of the prism).

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a triangular prism is given by:

\[
V = \text{Area of the triangle} \times \text{Length of the prism}
\]
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

Thus, the volume can be expressed as:

\[
V = \left( \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \right) \times l = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l
\]

Upon reviewing the function:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

This implementation is equivalent to the correct formula for the volume of a triangular prism. It first calculates the area of the triangle using `b * h / 2` and then multiplies it by `l` to get the volume.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

1. If the dimensions `b`, `h`, or `l` are zero, the volume should appropriately return zero, which is consistent with the expected behavior.
2. Negative values for `b`, `h`, and `l` should not be valid inputs for physical dimensions and should ideally be handled or acknowledged, but the function does not raise an error or provide a mechanism to handle negative values.
3. Non-numeric input would cause the function to raise a TypeError, which is not handled.

The main issue is that while the function correctly computes the volume given valid, positive numeric inputs, it does not handle cases where inputs are zero or negative appropriately. Additionally, it lacks input validation for non-numeric types.

The presence of these potential edge cases where the function does not work as expected leads to the conclusion that the function is not fully correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
