To determine if the provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism as described, we should first analyze the formula for the volume of a triangular prism. The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height of the Prism} \]

Where the base area of the triangle can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Thus, the complete formula for the volume of a triangular prism becomes:

\[ V = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l \]

where \( b \) is the base of the triangle, \( h \) is the height of the triangle, and \( l \) is the length of the prism.

Now, let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

The program calculates the volume using the formula that rearranges the base area correctly. However, there is a significant issue with the order of operations. According to standard operator precedence in Python:

1. The division (`/`) operator has higher precedence than the multiplication (`*`) operator.
2. This means that `b * h / 2 * l` is interpreted as `(b * h / 2) * l`, which is **not** the correct formula for the volume of the prism.

### Test Case
For example, if we input:
- \( b = 2 \)
- \( h = 3 \)
- \( l = 4 \)

The expected volume should be:

\[ V = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

However, the program will compute it as:

\[ V = 2 \times 3 / 2 \times 4 = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

In this particular case, it gives the correct answer, but let's consider the case when the base height \( h \) is 0. The expected volume would then be:

If \( b = 2 \), \( h = 0 \), \( l = 4 \):

\[ V = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 0 \times 4 = 0 \]

The program would still calculate it as:

\[ V = 2 \times 0 / 2 \times 4 = 0 \]

This will hold true for positive numbers, but if you input negative numbers or zero in different positions, or if you calculate using improper base or height values, the operational flow may lead to incorrect logic.

### Conclusion
Even though it appears to work for certain basic cases, primarily due to the nature of arithmetic multiplication and division, the logic implemented does not reliably or clearly represent the formula due to the incorrect ordering of operations and lack of handling for negative values or zero.

Therefore, the program lacks correctness.

Correctness: **False**.
