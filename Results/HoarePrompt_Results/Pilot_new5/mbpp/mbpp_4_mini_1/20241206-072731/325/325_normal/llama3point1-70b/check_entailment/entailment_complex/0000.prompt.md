You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if 'month' is one of the months with thirty days (4, 6, 9, 11); otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` (expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive) and returns `True` if `month` corresponds to April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11), which are the months with thirty days. For all other months, including those with thirty-one or twenty-eight days, it returns `False`. The function does not handle invalid inputs (months outside the range of 1 to 12).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
