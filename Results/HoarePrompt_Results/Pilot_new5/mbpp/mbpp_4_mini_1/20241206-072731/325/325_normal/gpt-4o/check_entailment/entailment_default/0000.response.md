The problem description requires a function to check if a given month number (from 1 to 12) has 30 days. Specifically, the months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function should return `True` for these months and `False` for other months.

The provided program defines a function `func_1(month: int) -> bool` which uses a set `months_with_30_days` to determine if the input month is one of the months that have 30 days. However, it does not handle the case where the input `month` is outside the valid range (1 to 12). According to the problem description, the function should only consider valid month numbers.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts an integer `month` between 1 and 12 and returns `True` if it corresponds to a month with 30 days; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, the hints also mention that there are no checks for invalid inputs, meaning that if an invalid month number (like 0 or 13) is passed, the function may still return either `True` or `False` without producing an error. This is an important issue because the function will not behave as expected if called with invalid input, even though the problem description implies it should only handle valid inputs.

Now, let's analyze the output hints and the code:

1. **Valid Months Check:** The function correctly identifies months with 30 days when provided with valid input (4, 6, 9, 11).
2. **Invalid Input Handling:** The function does not return an error or a specific output for invalid month numbers (like 0 or 13). For instance, if `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` is called, the function will return `False` as it won't find these values in the set, which is not the intended use according to the problem description.

Thus, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, especially regarding the handling of invalid inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The code does not handle the case where the input is outside the range of 1 to 12, leading to incorrect behavior for inputs that are not valid month numbers.
