Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are accurately included in the list `thirty_days_months`. The function checks if the input month is in this list and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. 

Hereâ€™s the breakdown for each possible input:
- For month 1 (January), it returns `False` (correct).
- For month 2 (February), it returns `False` (correct).
- For month 3 (March), it returns `False` (correct).
- For month 4 (April), it returns `True` (correct).
- For month 5 (May), it returns `False` (correct).
- For month 6 (June), it returns `True` (correct).
- For month 7 (July), it returns `False` (correct).
- For month 8 (August), it returns `False` (correct).
- For month 9 (September), it returns `True` (correct).
- For month 10 (October), it returns `False` (correct).
- For month 11 (November), it returns `True` (correct).
- For month 12 (December), it returns `False` (correct).

Since the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
