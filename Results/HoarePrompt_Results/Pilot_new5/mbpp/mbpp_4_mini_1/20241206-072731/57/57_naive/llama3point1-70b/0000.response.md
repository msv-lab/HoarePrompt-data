Correctness: **True**.

The program sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It uses `sorted()` with `key=str.lower`, which ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. This means that it will handle different cases of letters (e.g., 'a' and 'A') correctly by treating them as equal in terms of ordering.

The program should work correctly for all potential cases, including:
- Empty sublists (it will return an empty sublist).
- Sublists with mixed case strings (it will sort them correctly).
- Sublists with the same strings but in different cases (e.g., 'apple' and 'Apple' will be treated as equivalent in sorting).

Since it handles all these cases appropriately, the code is correct.
