The provided program is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. Let's analyze the problem description and the program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description:
The function must sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.

### Program Analysis:
1. The function defined is `func_1`, which takes a parameter `list_of_lists`.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function to sort the elements of each `sublist`.
3. The sorted result for each `sublist` is collected into a new list which is returned.

### Assertions:
The assertions provided in the code check whether the function `func_1` behaves as expected. Let's analyze these assertions:

1. **First Assertion:**
   - Input: `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])`
   - Expected Output: `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`
   - Actual Output from `func_1`: `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]` (This does not match, since the order of 'black' and 'orange' in the last sublist is incorrect.)

2. **Second Assertion:**
   - Input: `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])`
   - Expected Output: `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`
   - Actual Output from `func_1`: `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' brown', ' orange']]` (This does not match, the second sublist is incorrect.)

3. **Third Assertion:**
   - Input: `(['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])`
   - Expected Output: `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`
   - Actual Output from `func_1`: `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]` (This matches.)

### Conclusion:
The program has not correctly implemented the sorting functionality as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the sorting does not handle the inherent ordering based on the requirement of the assertion checks, as they are inconsistent with the expected outputs. The program failed at the first two assertions.

Correctness: **False**
