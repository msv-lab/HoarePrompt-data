Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of equal length containing numerical values and returns a tuple where each element is the difference of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, calculated as (a - b) for each pair (a, b) from the zipped tuples. The function assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` are of equal length; if they are not, a ValueError may occur during execution. **
