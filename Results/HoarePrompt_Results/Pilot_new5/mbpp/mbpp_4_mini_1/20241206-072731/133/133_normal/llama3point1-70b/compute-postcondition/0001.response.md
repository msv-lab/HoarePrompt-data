The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, containing numeric elements. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple that contains the element-wise differences of the numeric elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of numeric elements and return a tuple representing the differences between corresponding elements in the two tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, tup1 and tup2, of the same length containing numeric elements, and returns a tuple of the element-wise differences between the two tuples.**
