#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of equal length containing numerical values.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the difference of corresponding elements from tuples tup1 and tup2, calculated as (a - b) for each pair (a, b) from the zipped tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of equal length containing numerical values and returns a tuple where each element is the difference of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, calculated as (a - b) for each pair (a, b) from the zipped tuples. The function assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` are of equal length; if they are not, a ValueError may occur during execution.
