To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` and the statement that it should "subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index".

The code is as follows:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Tuple Pairing**: The function uses `zip(tup1, tup2)` to pair elements from the two tuples by index. This means that it only processes elements until the shorter tuple is exhausted.

2. **Subtraction**: The generator expression `(a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2))` correctly performs the subtraction for each pair of elements from the two tuples.

3. **Return Type**: The function returns a tuple containing the results of the subtractions.

### Potential Cases to Consider:
1. **Different Lengths**: If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, the function will only operate on the indices that exist in both tuples. For example:
   - Input: `tup1 = (5, 10, 15)` and `tup2 = (1, 2)` will result in `(5-1, 10-2)`, which gives `(4, 8)`. The last element `15` from `tup1` is ignored, which may be considered incorrect as it doesn't handle tuples of different lengths fully.

2. **Empty Tuples**: If both tuples are empty, the function will return an empty tuple, which is correct in this case. However:
   - Input: `tup1 = ()` and `tup2 = (1, 2)` will return `()`, which does not align with a meaningful operation.

3. **Non-Numeric Types**: If the tuples contain non-numeric types (e.g., strings), the operation `a - b` will raise a `TypeError`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not account for cases where the tuples have different lengths and does not handle non-numeric types gracefully. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements as stated in the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
