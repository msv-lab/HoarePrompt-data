Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the tuples `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths. According to the problem description, the function should subtract elements at the same index, but if the tuples have different lengths, it will result in an incomplete subtraction or an error. 

For example:
- If we call `func_1((10, 4), (2, 5, 18))`, it will only perform the subtraction for the first two elements and ignore the third element of `tup2`, leading to an incomplete result. This case demonstrates that the current implementation does not satisfy the problem requirements for all potential inputs. 

Thus, the function is not correct for all possible cases.
