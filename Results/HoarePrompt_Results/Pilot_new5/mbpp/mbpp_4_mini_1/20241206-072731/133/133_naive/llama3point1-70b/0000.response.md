Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and subtracts the elements of `tup2` from the corresponding elements of `tup1` using the `zip` function to pair elements by their indices. The use of a tuple comprehension allows for the creation of a new tuple containing the results of these subtractions. 

This implementation handles cases where the tuples are of the same length and returns the appropriate differences. If the tuples have different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the shortest tuple, which is a reasonable behavior for element-wise operations. Therefore, it works correctly for all potential cases that can be derived from the problem description.
