Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and for `n` greater than 1, it returns the nth term of a Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1. The sequence is defined such that each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. **
