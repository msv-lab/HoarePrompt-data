The tuple `(a, b)` is assigned the values of `(b, a + b)`. The previous values are `a = 1` and `b = 3`. 

Now, calculating the new values:
- The new value of `a` becomes `b`, which is `3`.
- The new value of `b` becomes `a + b`, which is `1 + 3 = 4`.

Therefore, the other variables remain unchanged, and the updated values are:
- `a` is now `3`
- `b` is now `4`

The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 is still valid. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
