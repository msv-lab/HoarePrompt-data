According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 2 to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `_` is currently 2 (which is the starting point of the range). For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. 

Additionally, to ensure the loop executes again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, because if `n` is exactly 2, the loop will not have a next iteration since the range would only include 2.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 2, `_` is 3**
