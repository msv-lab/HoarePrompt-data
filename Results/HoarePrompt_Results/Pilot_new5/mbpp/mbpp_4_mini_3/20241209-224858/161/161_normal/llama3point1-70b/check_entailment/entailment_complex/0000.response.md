The provided Python program is intended to calculate the n-th Lucas number according to the problem description. Let's analyze the implementation against the requirements:

1. **Lucas Number Definition**: The Lucas numbers are defined similarly to the Fibonacci numbers, but they start with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. Specifically:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

2. **Program Flow**:
   - When `n` is 0, the function correctly returns 2, which matches the definition.
   - When `n` is 1, the function correctly returns 1, which also matches the definition.
   - For `n > 1`, the function initializes `a` to 2 (L(0)) and `b` to 1 (L(1)) and correctly iterates through the sequence using a loop, updating `a` and `b` to represent the last two numbers in the sequence. After the loop, `b` holds the value of L(n).

3. **Conclusion**: The function correctly calculates the n-th Lucas number for all possible non-negative integers `n`. Since the implementation adheres to the definition of Lucas numbers as stated in the problem description, the program is indeed correct.

Therefore, the final output based on the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
