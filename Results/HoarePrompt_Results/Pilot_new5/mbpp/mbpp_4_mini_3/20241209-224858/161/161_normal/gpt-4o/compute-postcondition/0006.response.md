The values of `a` and `b` are both being assigned specific integers. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not defined, but they change to 2 and 1, respectively. The initial state of `n` remains valid. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
