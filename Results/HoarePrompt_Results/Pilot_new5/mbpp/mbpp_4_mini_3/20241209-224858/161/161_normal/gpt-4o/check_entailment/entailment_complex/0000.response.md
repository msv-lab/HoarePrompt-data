Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the function to find the nth Lucas number as specified in the problem description. Instead, it incorrectly calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

The Lucas sequence is defined similarly to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with different initial values:
- Lucas(0) = 2
- Lucas(1) = 1
- Lucas(n) = Lucas(n-1) + Lucas(n-2) for n >= 2

The function `func_1` correctly returns 2 for `n == 0` and 1 for `n == 1`, which is correct for the Lucas sequence. However, in the loop for `n >= 2`, the code is actually calculating the Fibonacci numbers instead of the Lucas numbers. Thus, the function will return Fibonacci numbers for inputs greater than or equal to 2, which does not satisfy the requirement of returning the nth Lucas number.

For example, for `n = 2`, the function returns `3` (which is Fibonacci(2), not Lucas(2)), and for `n = 9`, it returns `34` (which is Fibonacci(9), not Lucas(9)).

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, and the correct response is **False**.
