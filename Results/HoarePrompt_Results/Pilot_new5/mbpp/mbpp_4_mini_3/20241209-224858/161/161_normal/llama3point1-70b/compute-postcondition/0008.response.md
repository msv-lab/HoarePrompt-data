In the given code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` are being swapped and updated. Specifically, `a` is set to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is set to the previous value of `a` plus the previous value of `b`. 

Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. Therefore:
- The new value of `a` will be the previous value of `b`, which is 1.
- The new value of `b` will be the previous value of `a` (which is 2) plus the previous value of `b` (which is 1), resulting in 3.

Thus, the states of the affected variables are updated as follows:
- `a` is now 1
- `b` is now 3

The values of `n`, which is greater than or equal to 2 and not equal to 1, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
