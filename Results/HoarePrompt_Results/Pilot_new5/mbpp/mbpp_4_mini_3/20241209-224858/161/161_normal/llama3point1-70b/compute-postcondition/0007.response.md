According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `n`. The range for the loop is `range(2, n + 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2. Given that `n` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, it must also be at least 2. 

Before the loop starts, `n` must be adjusted so that the loop can execute correctly. Since the starting point of the range is 2, and the ending point is `n + 1`, the values of `a` and `b` do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The loop variable `_` will take values starting from 2 up to `n`, inclusive.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and its current value can be any integer greater than 1 (as stated). 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
