Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the n-th Lucas number as specified in the problem description. Instead, it computes the n-th Fibonacci number. 

The confusion arises from the return values and how the program is structured. The Lucas numbers are defined similarly to Fibonacci numbers but with different starting values: 

- The Lucas sequence starts with L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1.
- The Fibonacci sequence starts with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

In the provided program:
- When `n` is 0, it correctly returns 2 (the first Lucas number).
- When `n` is 1, it correctly returns 1 (the second Lucas number).
- However, for `n >= 2`, it uses a loop that computes Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers. The updated values for `a` and `b` in the loop are not reflecting the Lucas number calculation but rather the Fibonacci sequence.

For example:
- For `n = 2`, the program returns `L(2) = 3`, which is correct.
- For `n = 3`, the program returns `b`, which is calculated as `b = a + b` iteratively. This will yield the Fibonacci number rather than the Lucas number.

Thus, the program fails to adhere to the specifications of the problem description for cases where `n` is greater than 1, as it does not compute the correct Lucas numbers. 

In conclusion, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description as it computes Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers for `n >= 2`.
