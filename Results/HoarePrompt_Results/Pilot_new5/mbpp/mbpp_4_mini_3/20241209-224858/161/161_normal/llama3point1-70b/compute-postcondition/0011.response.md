According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from 2 up to `n + 1`. The loop will execute as long as the value of `_` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. 

Since the loop starts from 2, when `n` is 3, the range will be `range(2, 4)` (which includes 2 and 3). The loop will execute for the values 2 and 3, and the last value of `_` will be 3. For the loop to execute once more, `n` must be increased such that `n + 1` is greater than 4. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4, and the next value of `_` will be 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
