Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly calculates the nth Lucas number based on the provided problem description. The base cases for n = 0 and n = 1 return the expected values (2 and 1, respectively). For n >= 2, it uses an iterative approach to compute the Lucas numbers, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, which is the correct logic for generating the Lucas sequence. 

There are no edge cases or potential inputs where the function would fail to produce the correct result according to the definition of Lucas numbers. Thus, the implementation is correct.
