Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers, but it fails to handle the case where the list has an odd length. For instance, consider the list `[2, 1, 4]`. The index `1` (which is odd) contains the value `1` (which is odd), so the function would return `True`. However, the list does not fulfill the requirement as the odd index condition is not applicable to the last index `2`, which is not verified. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
