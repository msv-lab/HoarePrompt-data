To assess the correctness of the provided code, we start by analyzing the problem description and the program itself.

**Problem description:** The task is to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

**Initial Assessment:**
The program iterates through the list and checks if the index is odd (using `i % 2 != 0`). If it finds an even number at any of these odd indices (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

The logic seems to be aligned with the problem description, as it checks for even numbers at odd indices. However, it does not explicitly handle the case of an empty list or a list with only one element, which can be considered edge cases for this function.

**Output Hints:** The function accepts a list of integers and returns `False` if any even integers are found at odd indices; otherwise, it returns `True`.

**Cross-check with Output Hints:**
The output hints align with what the code is doing. The function correctly identifies even numbers at odd indices and returns `False` appropriately. 

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. An empty list `[]` should return `True` because there are no odd indices to check.
2. A list with a single element (e.g., `[1]`) should also return `True` since there are no odd indices in this case.
3. A list where all numbers are odd (e.g., `[1, 3, 5, 7]`) should return `True`, and one with any even number at an odd index (e.g., `[1, 2]` should return `False`).

Upon further inspection of the code, we observe that it correctly handles the empty list and single-element list cases since it will not find any even integers at odd indices in those scenarios, thus returning `True`.

The program appears to handle all cases outlined in the problem description and the output hints correctly.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **True**
