Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with an even number of elements, `i` is the index of the last odd integer checked (which is less than the length of `lst`), and if all the odd indexed elements in `lst` are odd integers, the function does not return anything (None). If any of those elements is even, the function returns False.**
