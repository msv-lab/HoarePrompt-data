#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with an even number of elements, `i` is the index of the last odd integer checked (which is less than the length of `lst`), and if all the odd indexed elements in `lst` are odd integers, the function does not return anything (None). If any of those elements is even, the function returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating all odd indexed elements in the list 'lst' are odd integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns False if any of the elements at odd indices are even integers. If all odd indexed elements are odd integers, it returns True. If the list is empty or has only one element, the function will return True, as there are no odd indexed elements to check.
