The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers called `lst`. It iterates through the list and checks each element; specifically, it looks at the indices of the list. If it encounters an odd index (`i % 2 != 0`), it checks if the corresponding element in the list (`lst[i]`) is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are true, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such case, the function returns `True`. 

The implications of this logic are that:

1. The function ensures that all elements at odd indices must be odd.
2. If `lst` is empty, the function will return `True`, as there are no elements to violate the condition.
3. The function does not specifically handle cases where `lst` contains non-integer types; it assumes the elements are integers as per the initial comment.

Overall, the annotations infer a broader understanding of the function's intent, but they do not explicitly outline all potential edge cases. The function strictly returns `True` if no even integers are present at odd indices and returns `False` if any are found.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and returns False if any even integers are found at odd indices; otherwise, it returns True.**
