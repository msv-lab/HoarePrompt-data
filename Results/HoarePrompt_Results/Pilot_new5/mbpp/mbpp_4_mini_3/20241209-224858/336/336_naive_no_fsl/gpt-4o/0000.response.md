To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it against the problem description: "Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list."

The program implementation is as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):  # Iterates over odd indices
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:  # Checks if the number at the odd index is even
            return False  # Returns False if any even number is found
    return True  # Returns True if all checks pass
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Loop through odd indices**: The loop correctly starts at index 1 and increments by 2, ensuring it checks only the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).
2. **Check for even numbers**: The condition `if lst[i] % 2 == 0` correctly identifies even numbers. If an even number is found at any odd index, it returns `False`.
3. **Return True**: If the loop finishes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it correctly returns `True`.

### Test Cases:
Let's examine the provided assertions:
- `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: 
  - Odd indices are 1 (1), 3 (3), 5 (7), 7 (3). All are odd. Correctly returns `True`.
  
- `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: 
  - Odd index 1 (1) is odd. There are no more odd indices in this list. Correctly returns `True`.

- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: 
  - Odd index 1 (2) is even. Correctly returns `False`.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider potential edge cases:
- An empty list `[]`: There are no indices to check, so it should return `True` since the condition is vacuously satisfied.
- A list with only one element `[1]`: Index 1 does not exist, so it should also return `True`.
- A list with even numbers at odd indices, for example `[1, 2, 3, 4]`: This should return `False` since index 1 (2) is even.

### Conclusion:
The existing assertions and checks cover various scenarios effectively. The program correctly identifies when odd indices contain even numbers and satisfies the problem description.

Therefore, after analyzing the program and the potential edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
