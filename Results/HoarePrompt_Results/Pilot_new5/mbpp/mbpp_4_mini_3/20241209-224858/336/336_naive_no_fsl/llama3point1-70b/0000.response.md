To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the requirements and the implementation.

**Problem Description:** The function should check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

1. **Odd Index Check:** The program iterates through each index `i` of the list `lst`.
2. **Condition:** It checks if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and whether the number at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
3. **Return Value:** If both conditions are met, it returns `False`, indicating that an odd index does not contain an odd number. If the loop completes without finding any such case, it returns `True`.

**Potential Issues:**
- The program correctly identifies if odd indices contain even numbers. However, it does not explicitly check if odd indices contain odd numbers. The problem statement specifies that odd indices should contain *odd* numbers, but the program only checks for the presence of even numbers.

**Test Case:**
Consider the following input:
```python
test_input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
- For this input:
   - Index 1 contains the value `2` (even), but the code only returns `False` for the presence of an even number.
   - Index 3 contains the value `4` (even).
- Expected output: `False` (because index 1 and 3 contain even numbers).
- The function will correctly return `False`.

Now consider an input that satisfies the requirement:
```python
test_input = [1, 3, 5, 7]
```
- For this input:
   - Index 1 contains `3` (odd).
   - Index 3 contains `7` (odd).
- The function will return `True`, which is correct.

**Edge Case Consideration:**
If we consider an empty list `[]`, there are no odd indices, and the function will return `True`. This behavior is consistent with the requirement since there are no odd indices to violate the condition.

However, if we input a list like:
```python
test_input = [2, 4, 6, 8]
```
- The function will return `False`, which is correct as there are no odd numbers at the odd indices.

**Conclusion:**
The program checks odd indices for even numbers correctly but does not check for odd numbers. Thus, the program is flawed in its logic, as it does not fulfill the specified requirement of verifying odd numbers at odd indices.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work as expected because it does not ensure that every odd index contains odd numbers, but rather only checks for even numbers, which does not cover the complete requirement.
