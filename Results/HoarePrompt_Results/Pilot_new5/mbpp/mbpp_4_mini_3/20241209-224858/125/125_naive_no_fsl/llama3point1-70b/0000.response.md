To determine the correctness of the provided program, we must check whether the function `func_1(lst, n)` correctly splits the list `lst` into sublists based on every `nth` element, as described in the problem statement.

The provided program is:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Functionality**:
   - The function takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`.
   - The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates sublists starting from each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, taking every `n`th element from that starting point.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - For `n = 2`, it should split the list into two sublists, one starting from index `0` (even indices) and one starting from index `1` (odd indices).
   - For `n = 3`, it should produce three sublists starting from indices `0`, `1`, and `2`, respectively.
   - If `n` is greater than the length of the list, the output should be a list of empty lists.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is `0`, it will cause an error when trying to slice the list with step `0`.
   - If the list is empty, the output should be an empty list regardless of the value of `n`.
   - If `n` is negative, the behavior is undefined in the context of the problem (the slicing might not make sense).

### Testing Edge Cases

- **Case 1**: `func_1([], 2)` should return `[]` (correct).
- **Case 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)` should return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]` (correct).
- **Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)` should return `[[1, 4], [2, 5], [3]]` (correct).
- **Case 4**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0)` will raise an error (incorrect behavior).
- **Case 5**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -1)` will still work but does not logically match the problem description (incorrect behavior).

### Conclusion
The function has not addressed cases where `n` is `0` or negative. Since the program does not handle these cases appropriately and produces incorrect results or errors, we conclude that the program does not meet the problem descriptionâ€™s requirements.

Correctness: **False**
