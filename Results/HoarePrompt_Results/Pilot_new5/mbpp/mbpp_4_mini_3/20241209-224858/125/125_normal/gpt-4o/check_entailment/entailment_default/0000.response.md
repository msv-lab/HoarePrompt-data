The given problem description states that the function should take a list and an integer `n`, and split the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. 

The provided code:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```
appears to create `n` empty sublists and then iterates through the input list, appending each element to one of the sublists based on the index.

Now let's consider edge cases and whether the code adheres to the problem description:

1. **Valid Case for `n`:** The code does handle the valid case where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`.
2. **Invalid Case for `n`:** If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function does not explicitly handle this case. The problem description suggests this should be considered invalid.
3. **Empty List Case:** If `lst` is empty, the function will return a list of `n` empty lists, which may or may not be the desired behavior based on the problem description (it does not specify what to return in this case).
4. **Single Element Case:** If `lst` has only one element, the function would return a list containing one sublist with that single element, which seems correct as per the description.

Now, let's review the output hints:
- The output hints mention that the function assumes `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`, but does not handle cases where `n` is larger than the length of `lst`. This aligns with the earlier observation that the function lacks handling for such scenarios.

Given these considerations, we observe that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly regarding the case where `n` exceeds the length of `lst`.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, leading to potentially unexpected behavior which contradicts the problem requirements.
