#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` contains `n` sublists, each of which has elements from `lst` distributed in a round-robin fashion, `lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
    return result
    #The program returns 'result' which contains 'n' sublists, each populated with elements from 'lst' distributed in a round-robin manner, where 'n' is a positive integer and not greater than the length of 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It distributes the elements of `lst` into `n` sublists in a round-robin manner, and returns these sublists as a list of lists. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, it is assumed that the input is invalid, but the function does not handle this case explicitly, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
