Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description because it incorrectly splits the list into sublists based on the indexes from `0` to `n-1`, rather than splitting the list every `n` elements. The intended functionality is to take the list and create sublists that consist of every `n`-th element from the original list, but the implementation uses the slicing syntax `lst[i::n]`, which leads to creating groups of elements based on their index rather than a correct partitioning of the list.

For example, if the input list `lst` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the output should be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, meaning it would create two sublists where each sublist contains every second element. However, the current implementation would produce `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which is the correct output for this specific case. But if we consider the case where `n = 3`, it should split into three sublists, each containing every third element. The implementation would return multiple sublists incorrectly based on the number of elements rather than splitting them as intended.

Thus, the implementation does not consistently follow the problem description requirements for all general cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
