The provided program is designed to split a list into sublists based on a given integer `n`, where each sublist contains elements at every `n`th position starting from indices `0` to `n-1`. 

The implementation:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Initial Assessment:
The code appears to use list comprehension to create `n` sublists by slicing the original list `lst`. The slicing `lst[i::n]` takes every `n`th element starting from index `i`. 

However, we need to consider potential edge cases that the function might not handle correctly:
1. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the slicing will not produce any sublists as there will not be enough elements to create groups.
2. If `lst` is empty, the function should ideally return an empty list, but it will attempt to create sublists based on `n`, which could cause an issue since there are no elements to slice.

### Output Hints:
The output hints specify that the function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It mentions that there are no error checks for when `n` is out of bounds or when `lst` is empty, which could lead to unexpected behavior. 

This suggests that the program might not correctly handle cases where:
- `n` is larger than the length of `lst`, which would lead to incorrect results (most likely an IndexError or a misleading output).
- `lst` is empty, which would also lead to misleading behavior.

### Agreement of Output Hints with Code:
The hints provide a valid critique of the code. They accurately point out potential issues regarding out-of-bounds values for `n` and the lack of handling for an empty list. This indicates that the code is indeed not robust and does not cover all specified cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description, particularly:
- If `n` exceeds the length of `lst`, it likely produces an incorrect or unexpected result.
- If the input list is empty, the code does not account for that scenario.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
