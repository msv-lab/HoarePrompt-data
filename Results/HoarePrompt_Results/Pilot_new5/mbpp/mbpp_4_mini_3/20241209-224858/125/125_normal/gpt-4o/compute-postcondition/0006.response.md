The code appends `element`, which is the third element of `lst`, to the sublist at index `i % n` of `result`. Since `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `i % n` will result in either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `n`. The previous state of the `result` variable will be updated to include the `element` in the appropriate sublist.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` must be at least 2 and `n <= len(lst)`, `result` now contains `n` sublists with `element` appended to `result[i % n]`, where `i` is 2.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` must be at least 2 and `n <= len(lst)`, `result` now contains `n` sublists with `element` appended to one of the sublists determined by `i % n`, where `i` is 2.**
