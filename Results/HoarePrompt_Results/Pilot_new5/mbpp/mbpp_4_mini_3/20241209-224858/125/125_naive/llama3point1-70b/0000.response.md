Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem description requires splitting the list for every nth element and returning a list of the resulting lists. However, the current implementation uses a list comprehension that generates sublists starting from each index up to n, which leads to incorrect behavior.

For example, consider the input `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`. The expected behavior would be to split the list into two sublists: `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`. However, the current implementation would produce the output `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]` using slicing incorrectly due to `lst[i::n]`, which is not achieving the desired split according to every nth element from the start of the list.

To further illustrate this, the input `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` with `n = 3` should yield `[[1, 4], [2, 5], [3]]`, but the current implementation would result in incorrect sublists.

Thus, since it does not satisfy the requirement to split the list correctly based on every nth element, the program is incorrect.
