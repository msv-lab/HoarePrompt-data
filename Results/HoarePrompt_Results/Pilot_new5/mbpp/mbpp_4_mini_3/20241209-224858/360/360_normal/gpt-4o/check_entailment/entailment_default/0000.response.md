To evaluate the given program against the problem description, let's break down the provided information.

**Problem Description Summary**: 
The function is supposed to return the inner list from a list of lists that has the highest sum. If the input list is empty, it should return an empty list. If all inner lists are empty, it should still return an empty list.

**Program Analysis**:
The provided function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity, which is appropriate for comparing sums.
2. It iterates through each inner list (`sublist`) in `list_of_lists`.
3. For each `sublist`, it calculates the sum (`current_sum`).
4. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current `sublist`.
5. Finally, it returns `max_list`.

The code seems to handle the basic requirement of finding the sublist with the maximum sum. However, we must consider edge cases:

1. **Empty Input List**: If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will not enter the loop and will return the initialized empty list (`max_list`), which is correct.
2. **All Inner Lists Empty**: If all inner lists are empty (e.g., `list_of_lists = [[], [], []]`), the function will again not enter the loop and will return the initialized empty list (`max_list`), which is also correct.
3. **Single Inner List**: If there is only one inner list, such as `[[2, 3, 1]]`, the function will correctly return `[2, 3, 1]`, as per the example provided.

We can also consider scenarios like:
- A mix of positive and negative numbers: `[[1, -1], [2, 2], [-3, -4]]` should correctly return `[2, 2]` as it has the highest sum.
- All lists having equal sums: `[[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]]` should return any of the inner lists, as they all have the same highest sum.
  
Now let's check the **Output Hints**:
- The function returns the sublist with the maximum sum.
- If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns an empty list.
- If all inner lists are empty, it also returns an empty list.

The output hints align with the behavior of the function as described. The function is comprehensive in its handling of the described cases.

**Final Assessment**: 
Since the code correctly implements the specified functionality, including handling edge cases as described in the problem statement and consistent with the output hints, we determine that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
