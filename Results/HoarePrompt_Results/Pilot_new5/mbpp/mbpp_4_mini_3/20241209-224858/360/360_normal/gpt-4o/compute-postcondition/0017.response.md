Postcondition: ***`max_sum` is equal to the previous `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, and `list_of_lists` must have at least `k + 1` sublists. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_list` is updated to be equal to `sublist` and `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`.***
