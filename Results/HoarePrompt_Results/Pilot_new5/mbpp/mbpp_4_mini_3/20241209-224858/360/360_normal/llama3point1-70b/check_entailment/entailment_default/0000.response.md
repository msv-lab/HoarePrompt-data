The provided program aims to return the inner list from a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The implementation uses the `max` function with the `key` parameter set to `sum`, which should work correctly to find the list with the maximum sum.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` indeed returns the list with the highest sum based on the problem description.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list `lists` is empty, the `max` function will raise a `ValueError`, which is a potential issue not addressed in the problem description.
   - If all inner lists are empty, the function does not handle that case explicitly, leading to a similar issue where it would return an empty list or raise an error depending on Python behavior.

### Review of Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function will return the inner list with the highest sum, or an empty list or raise a `ValueError` if the input list is empty. Additionally, the hints indicate that cases where all inner lists are empty are not being handled.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly when the input list is empty or when all inner lists are empty. Therefore, the function is incomplete and incorrect as it does not adequately handle all specified scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails because it does not handle the scenario where the input list is empty or where all the inner lists are empty.
