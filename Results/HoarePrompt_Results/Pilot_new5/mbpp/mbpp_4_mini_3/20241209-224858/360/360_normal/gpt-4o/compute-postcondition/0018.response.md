To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze how the variables evolve during the loop's execution.

The loop iterates over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`. For each sublist, it calculates the `current_sum`, which is the total of the numerical elements in that sublist. Then, it compares this `current_sum` to `max_sum`. If `current_sum` is greater, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current `sublist`. 

If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `max_sum` remains float('-inf'), while `max_list` remains an empty list.

If there are elements in `list_of_lists`, after the loop executes through all the sublists, `max_sum` will hold the highest sum of any of the `sublist` sums, and `max_list` will be the `sublist` that had this highest sum.

The output state after all iterations of the loop are complete will be:

Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum sum of any sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the sublist corresponding to that maximum sum, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing numerical elements. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_sum` is float('-inf') and `max_list` is an empty list.**
