Postcondition: ***`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is greater than float('-inf'); `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, and `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` remains unchanged, `max_list` remains an empty list, and `current_sum` is still equal to `sum(sublist)`.***
