The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. The previous values indicate that `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, and `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, which means that `max_sum` was also equal to `sum(sublist)`. The state of `max_list` now reflects the value of `sublist`. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`**.
