Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as its input, where each inner list contains numerical elements (either integers or floats).

1. The function uses the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument. This means that it will evaluate each inner list and calculate its sum, and then return the inner list that has the highest sum.

2. There is no ambiguity in the task: it clearly states that the function should return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. The program adheres to this requirement by using a built-in function that correctly identifies and returns the desired list.

3. The program would handle various scenarios, such as:
   - Lists with both positive and negative numbers.
   - Empty inner lists (if they exist, they will be evaluated as having a sum of zero).
   - Different data types (assuming only numerical types are present as stated).

Given that the implementation meets the outlined requirements systematically and correctly, it is deemed accurate. Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
