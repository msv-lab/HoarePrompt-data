The `current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of `sublist`. Since `max_sum` is initially float('-inf'), it will not be affected by the sum operation, and `max_list` remains unchanged as it is an empty list. The value of `current_sum` will be the sum of all elements in `sublist`, but the specific value depends on the contents of `sublist`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, and `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list_of_lists.

Output State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, and `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list_of_lists.**
