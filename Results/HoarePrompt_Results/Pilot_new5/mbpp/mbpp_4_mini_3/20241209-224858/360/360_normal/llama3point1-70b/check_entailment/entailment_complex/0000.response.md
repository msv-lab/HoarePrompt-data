Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input list `lists` is empty. According to the problem description, the function should return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. However, the implementation uses the `max` function, which will raise a `ValueError` if `lists` is empty, instead of returning an empty list or a defined output. Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirement of returning a valid output for all potential cases, specifically when `lists` is empty.
