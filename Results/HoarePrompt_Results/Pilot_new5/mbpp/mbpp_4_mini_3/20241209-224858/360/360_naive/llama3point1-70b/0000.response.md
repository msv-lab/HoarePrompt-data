Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly identifies the list within a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The use of the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument ensures that it compares the lists based on their sums. 

Here are the considerations confirming its correctness:

1. **Non-empty lists**: The function will work as expected for non-empty lists of lists. It will return the list with the highest sum.
2. **Empty lists**: If all lists in the input are empty, the function will still return one of the empty lists, which is valid since the sum of an empty list is zero, and all empty lists are equal.
3. **Single-list input**: If the input consists of a single list, that list will be returned since it is the only option.
4. **Mixed content**: The function can handle a variety of numeric types within the lists (integers, floats), and it will properly compute their sums.

Given these points, I cannot find a case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
