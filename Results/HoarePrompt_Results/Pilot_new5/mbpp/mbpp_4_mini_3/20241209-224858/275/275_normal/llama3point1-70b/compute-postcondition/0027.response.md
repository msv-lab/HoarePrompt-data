Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, and if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j` less than `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by any `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` retains its original value.***
