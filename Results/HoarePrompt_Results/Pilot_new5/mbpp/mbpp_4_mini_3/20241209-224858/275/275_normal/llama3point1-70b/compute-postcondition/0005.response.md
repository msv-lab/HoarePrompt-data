According to the code, the loop is set to execute for `i` starting from 1 and going up to `len(nums) - 1`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers and is not empty, `len(nums)` is at least 1, ensuring that `i` will start from 1. The values of `i` at the beginning of the first iteration will be 1, and the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`.

The important points to consider are:
1. `nums` is not empty, which means `len(nums)` is at least 1; therefore, `i` can start from 1.
2. `dp` is filled with 1s and is the same length as `nums`, which means it's properly initialized for the loop's execution.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the conditions are met for `i` to start at 1, and it's already guaranteed by the state provided.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` filled with 1s, `i` is 1**
