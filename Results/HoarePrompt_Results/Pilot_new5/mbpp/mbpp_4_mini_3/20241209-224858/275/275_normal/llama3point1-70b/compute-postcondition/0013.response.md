According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again for the current value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers, and `dp` is a list filled with 1s. Since the loop is iterating for `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, the next iteration will have `j` equal to `i - 1`, meaning for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `j` will then range from 0 to `i`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` filled with 1s, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 1**
