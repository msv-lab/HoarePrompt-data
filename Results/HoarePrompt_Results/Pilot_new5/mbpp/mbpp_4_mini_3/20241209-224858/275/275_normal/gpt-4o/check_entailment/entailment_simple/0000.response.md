Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the solution to the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description:

1. **Handling Empty Lists**: The function checks if the input list `nums` is empty and correctly returns `0`, which is expected behavior since there are no subsets to consider.

2. **Sorting the List**: By sorting the input list `nums`, the function ensures that when checking divisibility, we only need to consider pairs where the second number is less than or equal to the first (i.e., `nums[j]` is always less than or equal to `nums[i]`).

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function uses a dynamic programming approach, where an array `dp` is created. Each element `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`. This is done by iterating over all previous numbers, and for each number, it checks if it is divisible by any of its predecessors. If it is, it updates `dp[i]` to reflect the longest subset found.

4. **Correct Calculation**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value found in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset where each pair is divisible.

The function's logic ensures that it correctly counts the largest subset of divisible numbers for all valid inputs, thus fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
