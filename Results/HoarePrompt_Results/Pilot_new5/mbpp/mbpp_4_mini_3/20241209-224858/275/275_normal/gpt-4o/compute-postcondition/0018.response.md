According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` which iterates from 0 to `i - 1`. Since `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, the loop will execute if `i` is at least 1. Given that `nums` must have at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, it ensures that `len(nums)` is at least 1. Thus, `i` will be at least 1, allowing the loop to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be `i - 1`, which is `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state can be expressed as:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least len(nums) + 1 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to len(nums) + 1 initialized to 1, `i` is len(nums), `j` is 0**
