Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements; `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each index; `i` is equal to `len(nums)`; `j` has iterated through all indices from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`; `dp[len(nums)]` is equal to the length of the longest divisible subsequence that ends with `nums[len(nums)]`.**
