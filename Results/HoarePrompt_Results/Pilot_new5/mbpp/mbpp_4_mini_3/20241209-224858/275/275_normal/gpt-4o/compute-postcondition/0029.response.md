According to the code, the loop will iterate based on the variable `i`, which is controlled by `range(len(nums))`. The variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(nums)`, which means the loop has completed all its iterations and cannot execute again since `range(len(nums))` does not include `len(nums)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than `len(nums)`, and we would need to consider the next value of `i`, which should be `len(nums) + 1`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements; `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each index; `i` is `len(nums) + 1`, and `j` has iterated through all indices from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.**
