According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`. Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must have a value that allows the loop to execute one more time.

If `i` is the current index, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next index `j` will be `i - 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 1 to allow `j` to be 0.

State: **`dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, `i` must be at least 1**
