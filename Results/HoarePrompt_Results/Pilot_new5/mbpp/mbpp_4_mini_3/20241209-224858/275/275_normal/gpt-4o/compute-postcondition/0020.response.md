The code assigns `dp[i]` the maximum value between its current value `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. The current state indicates that `dp` is initially a list of length equal to `len(nums) + 1`, initialized to 1, and at least one condition holds true: `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. 

Given that `dp` starts with all elements equal to 1, the previous value of `dp[i]` is also 1. The value of `dp[j]` is 1 as well since all elements are initialized to 1. Therefore, `dp[j] + 1` equals 2. 

Thus, the maximum value between `dp[i]` (which is 1) and `dp[j] + 1` (which is 2) is 2. Consequently, `dp[i]` is updated to 2.

The other variables `nums`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that has at least len(nums) + 1 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to len(nums) + 1 initialized to 1, `i` is len(nums), `j` is 0, `dp[i]` is 2.**
