According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` equal to `len(nums)` and `j` is 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes 1. Since `i` is still equal to `len(nums)`, the condition for the loop to run again (i.e., `j < i`) is still valid. 

Additionally, since `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, this does not change. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least len(nums) + 1 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to len(nums) + 1 initialized to 1, `i` is len(nums), and `j` is 1**
