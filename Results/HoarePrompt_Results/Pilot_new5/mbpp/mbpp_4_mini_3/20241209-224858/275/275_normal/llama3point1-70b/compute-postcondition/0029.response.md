According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the length of the `nums` list. The for loop starts at `i = 1` and continues until `i` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `len(nums)` must be greater than 2.

State: **`dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, `i` is 2, and `len(nums)` must be greater than 2**.
