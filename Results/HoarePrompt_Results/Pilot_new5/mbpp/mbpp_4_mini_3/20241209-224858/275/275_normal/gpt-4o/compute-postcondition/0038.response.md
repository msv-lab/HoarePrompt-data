The statement `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value at index `i` of the list `dp`. The value of `dp[i]` is compared with `dp[j] + 1`, and `dp[i]` is assigned the greater of the two. 

Since `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, this means we are setting `dp[len(nums)]` based on the current values at those indices. The variable `j` is fixed at 2, so we will be calculating `dp[2] + 1`.

However, we do not have the specific values of `dp` at this point, which means we cannot specify exactly what `dp[i]` or `dp[j]` is. We can only say that `dp[i]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[2] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements; `dp` is updated such that `dp[len(nums)]` equals `max(dp[len(nums)], dp[2] + 1)`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 2.**
