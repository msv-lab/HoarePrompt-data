Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each index, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[len(nums)]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + 1`.***
