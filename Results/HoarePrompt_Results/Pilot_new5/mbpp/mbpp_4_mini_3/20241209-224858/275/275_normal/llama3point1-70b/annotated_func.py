#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the list 'nums' is currently empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` indicates the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, based on the divisibility conditions applied to all previous elements in `nums`. If `len(nums)` is at least 1, `dp` starts as a list of 1s and is updated based on the divisibility relationships between the elements of `nums`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subset from the list `dp`, which indicates the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with each corresponding element in the list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if `nums` is empty. If `nums` is not empty, it calculates and returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subset from the list, where an element of the subset is divisible by its preceding elements in the original list.
