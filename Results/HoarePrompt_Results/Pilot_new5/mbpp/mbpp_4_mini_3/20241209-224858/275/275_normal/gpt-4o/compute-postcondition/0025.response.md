According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(nums)`, which means `j` has iterated from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` can take on the next value, which is `len(nums)`.

Since `len(nums)` is the current value of `i`, the loop will execute again if `j` can be `len(nums)` or less. However, for `j` to be equal to `len(nums)`, the range of the for loop must be adjusted, which is not the case here as the loop is defined from `0` to `i - 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, it has to iterate with `j` being `len(nums)` or valid values less than it, and since `nums` is a sorted list with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, the loop cannot execute again as there are no valid `j` indices left.

Thus, the values do not change, and `j` will remain at 1, which does not allow for further iterations.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least len(nums) + 1 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to len(nums) + 1 initialized to 1, `i` is len(nums), and `j` is 1**
