According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i-1`, which means it can execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than `0`, and the loop is currently at the last value where `j` was `i-1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by `1`, making `i` equal to the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`). This means that `j` will iterate from `0` to `i` in the next iteration. 

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute again, we can conclude that `i` must be incremented by `1`.

State: **`dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, for `i` must be greater than 0.**
