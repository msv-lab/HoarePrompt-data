The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]`. The current value of `dp[i]` is compared with `dp[j] + 1`, and `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum of the two values. The state of `dp[j]` remains unchanged. 

Since `i` is `1` and `j` is `0`, we will use these indices to compute the new value for `dp[1]`. The current state provides that `dp[j]` (which is `dp[0]`) is `1`, so `dp[j] + 1` equals `2`. 

Now, if `dp[i]` was originally `1`, we will compute the maximum between `1` and `2`. Therefore, `dp[i]` will be updated to `2`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, filled with 1s except `dp[1]` which is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.**
