The code updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the current value of `dp[j]`. Since `i` must be greater than `j`, the maximum value of `dp[i]` will be determined by comparing its current value with `dp[j] + 1`. 

In the precondition, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` filled with 1s. The specific values of `dp` would depend on the values of `nums`, but we know that `dp[j]` will be less than `dp[i]` if `nums[j]` divides `nums[i]`, increasing `dp[i]` by 1 with respect to `dp[j]`. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers; `dp` is updated at index `i` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `i` is greater than `j`.**
