Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least len(nums) + 1 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to len(nums) + 1 initialized to 1, `i` is len(nums), and `j` is 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + 1`.***
