According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over a range determined by the length of the `nums` list. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers and is not empty, `len(nums)` is guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once. 

In each iteration of the loop, `i` will take on values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will equal `len(nums) - 1`. 

Since `dp` is initialized to a list of length equal to `len(nums)` with all elements set to 1, this state remains unchanged before the loop starts.

Thus, for the loop to execute:

- `nums` is a sorted list of integers (not empty).
- `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` with all elements initialized to 1.
- At the start of the loop, `i` is 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` initialized to 1, `i` is 0**
