    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subset for each index, with each `dp[i]` reflecting the maximum length of any divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of any divisible subset from the list 'nums' as reflected in the list 'dp'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums`. It returns 0 if `nums` is empty; otherwise, it returns the maximum length of any subset of `nums` where each element in the subset is divisible by at least one other element in that subset.
