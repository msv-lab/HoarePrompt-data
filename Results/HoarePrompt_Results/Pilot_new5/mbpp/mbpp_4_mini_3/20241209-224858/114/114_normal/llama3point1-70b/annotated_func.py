#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and elem can be of any data type.
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)
    #The program returns the count of occurrences of 'elem' in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, returning the count of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. It correctly counts elements of any data type within the tuple, including duplicates and cases where `elem` is not present, returning 0 in such cases.
