Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple and an element, and it correctly counts the occurrences of the specified element in the tuple using the `count` method. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Type Handling**: The function accepts two parameters: a tuple (`tup`) and an `element`. In Python, tuples can contain elements of any data type, which aligns with the problem description stating that the element can be of "any data type". 

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The method `tup.count(element)` is utilized, which is a built-in method of tuples that returns the number of times the specified element appears in the tuple. This directly fulfills the requirement of counting occurrences of the element.

3. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program check various cases:
   - When the element is not present in the tuple (e.g., counting `4` in the tuple results in `0` occurrences).
   - When the element is present multiple times (e.g., counting `10` results in `3` occurrences, and counting `8` results in `4` occurrences).
   These assertions validate that the function works correctly for different scenarios.

Overall, the function adheres to the problem's requirements and handles edge cases effectively, confirming that it is implemented correctly.
