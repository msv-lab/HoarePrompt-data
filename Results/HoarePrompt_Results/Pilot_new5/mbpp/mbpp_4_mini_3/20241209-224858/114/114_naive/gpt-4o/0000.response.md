Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality to count the occurrences of a specified element in a tuple using the `count` method. 

1. The `func_1` function takes two arguments: a tuple and an element to count within that tuple.
2. It uses the built-in `count` method of the tuple, which accurately counts how many times the specified element appears in the tuple.

The assertions provided in the code also confirm that the program works correctly for the specified test cases:
- For element `4`, it correctly returns `0` since `4` is not present in the tuple.
- For element `10`, it correctly returns `3` since `10` appears three times in the tuple.
- For element `8`, it correctly returns `4` since `8` appears four times in the tuple.

Since no edge cases or incorrect behaviors are observed in the examples provided, the program meets the problem description requirements entirely.
