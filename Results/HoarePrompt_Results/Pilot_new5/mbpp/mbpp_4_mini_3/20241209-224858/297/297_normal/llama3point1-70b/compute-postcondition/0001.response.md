The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a tuple of integers with at least two elements. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of integers from the tuple `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of integers `numbers` with at least two elements and return a tuple of products of each consecutive pair of integers in `numbers`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of integers `numbers` with at least two elements and returns a tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of integers from `numbers`.**
