The annotated program does correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. Let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description:
The function must take a tuple of numbers and return a new tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements from the input tuple.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple `t`.
2. **Length Requirement**: The problem states that the function should handle tuples of at least length 2, which is enforced by the assertions provided. The fourth assertion `(12,) == ()` serves as an example of a tuple with a single element, which is outside the specified requirement, but it doesn't affect the function's correctness with valid inputs.
3. **Logic**:
   - The function uses a tuple comprehension to generate a new tuple. 
   - It iterates over the indices of the input tuple `t`, specifically from `0` to `len(t) - 2`.
   - For each index `i`, it computes the product `t[i] * t[i + 1]`, effectively multiplying each element with its adjacent next element.
4. **Output**: The result is a tuple of products as expected.

### Assertions:
The assertions test the function with various inputs, ensuring that the function produces the expected outputs:
- For the input `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the output is `(5, 35, 56, 80)`, which correctly corresponds to the products of adjacent elements.
- Similar checks are done for other test cases, confirming that the function meets the requirement for all tested tuples of length at least 2.

### Conclusion:
The function handles the specified task as required by the problem description. It returns the correct output for tuples of length 2 or more. 

Thus, since the function meets the requirements set forth in the problem description, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
