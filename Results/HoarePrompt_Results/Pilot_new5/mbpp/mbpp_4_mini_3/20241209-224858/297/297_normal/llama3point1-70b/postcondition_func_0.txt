The function accepts a tuple of integers `numbers` with at least two elements and returns a tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of integers from `numbers`. It does not handle cases where `numbers` has fewer than two elements, as it assumes there will always be at least two elements. Therefore, it may raise an error if called with an invalid input.
