Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, checking if the current element matches the target element. 

The provided assertions test the function with various scenarios:
1. `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)` correctly returns `0`, which is the last position of `1`.
2. `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)` correctly returns `2`, which is the last position of `1` in the array.
3. `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)` correctly returns `3`, which is the last position of `3`.

The function also handles cases where the target element is not present, returning `-1`, which is the expected behavior.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
