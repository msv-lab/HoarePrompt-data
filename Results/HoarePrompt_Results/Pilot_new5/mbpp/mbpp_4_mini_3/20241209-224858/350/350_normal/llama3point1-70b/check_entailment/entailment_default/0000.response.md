The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array in reverse, checking for the last occurrence of the `target` element and returns its index. If the `target` is not found, it returns `-1`.

### Initial Assessment:
- The code correctly implements a reverse iteration through the sorted array to find the last occurrence of the `target`. 
- The function should correctly handle cases where the `target` is present multiple times in the list, returning the index of the last occurrence.
- It returns `-1` when the `target` is not present in the list.

### Edge Cases:
- The function appears to handle edge cases well, such as:
  - An empty list (returns `-1`).
  - All elements in the list being duplicates of the `target`.
  - The `target` being the first or last element in the array.

### Output Hints:
The output hints clearly state that the function will return the index of the last occurrence of `target` in the sorted list or `-1` if not found. This aligns with the intended functionality of the function.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the task described in the problem. There are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly based on the problem description and the provided output hints.

Correctness: **True**.
