According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` and its length. The loop iterates from the last index down to 0, which means `arr` must contain at least 1 element for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` will initially be set to the last index of the list before the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, and `target` does not impact the loop's ability to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `target` is an integer**
