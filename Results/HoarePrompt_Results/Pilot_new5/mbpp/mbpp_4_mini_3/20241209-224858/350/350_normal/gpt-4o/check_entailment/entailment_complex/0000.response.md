Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Specification**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x`, an integer whose last position we need to find in `arr`.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The program uses a for loop to iterate through the list `arr` from the last index to the first. This ensures that if `x` appears multiple times, the first instance it finds will be the last occurrence of `x` in the list. 

3. **Return Values**:
   - If the loop finds `x`, it immediately returns the index `i`, which corresponds to the last occurrence of `x`.
   - If `x` is not found after checking all elements, the function returns -1, which correctly indicates that `x` is not present in `arr`.

4. **Correctness on Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where `x` appears multiple times, once, or not at all in the list.
   - It also returns -1 if `arr` is empty, which aligns with the requirement that there would be no elements to find `x` in.

Overall, the function's approach of iterating from the end of the list to the beginning guarantees that it will find the last occurrence efficiently and correctly. Therefore, it adheres to the problem description perfectly.
