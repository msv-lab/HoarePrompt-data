According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in `arr`. Since the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`, the loop will execute again if `i` is still greater than or equal to `0`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so it will be `len(arr) - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `len(arr) - 2`. Therefore, `i` will be `len(arr) - 2` before the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be at least `0`, which will still hold true since `arr` contains at least 1 integer.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that contains at least 1 integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`.**
