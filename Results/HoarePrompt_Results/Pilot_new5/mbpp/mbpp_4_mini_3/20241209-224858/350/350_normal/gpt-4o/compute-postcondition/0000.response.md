According to the code, the loop will execute by iterating backward through the indices of the array `arr`. The loop will execute as long as `len(arr)` is greater than 0. If `arr` is empty (i.e., `len(arr) == 0`), the loop will not execute, and the index `i` will not be defined. 

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to confirm that `arr` is not empty. Additionally, `i` will be initialized to the last index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`**
