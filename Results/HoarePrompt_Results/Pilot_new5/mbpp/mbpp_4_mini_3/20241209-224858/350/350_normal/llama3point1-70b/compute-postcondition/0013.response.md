Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of sorted integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` if found; otherwise, it returns -1 if `target` is not present in the list. The function handles the case of duplicates by returning the index of the last occurrence and uses a reverse iteration through `arr` to find the target. **
