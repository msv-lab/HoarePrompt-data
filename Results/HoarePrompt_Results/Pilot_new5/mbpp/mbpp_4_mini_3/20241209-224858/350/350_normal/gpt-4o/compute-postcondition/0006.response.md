Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order containing at least 1 integer, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `x`, the function returns the value of `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 2`. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.***
