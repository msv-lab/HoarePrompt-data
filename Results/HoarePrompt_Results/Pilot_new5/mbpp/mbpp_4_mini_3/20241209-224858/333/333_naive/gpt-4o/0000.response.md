Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to check if the given expression is balanced or not. However, it fails to handle all edge cases properly. For example, consider the input `'{[()]}'`. The program would correctly identify this as balanced, but it would also give a wrong result for inputs like `'{[}'` or `'{{}'`, which are not directly tested in the assertions provided.

Additionally, if the expression consists of characters not related to brackets (like letters or digits), the program currently does not handle those cases. For example, the input `'{a[b]c}'` would not return the expected output, as it should ideally ignore non-bracket characters or treat them in a specific way according to the problem description.

Thus, since there are potential cases where the program does not produce the expected results according to the problem description, the correctness is deemed **False**.
