Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `expression`, and `stack` may or may not contain the previous character based on its presence in `brackets`. If `char` is in `brackets.values()`, and if `stack` is empty or the last character popped from `stack` does not match the corresponding bracket for `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no return value specified and the state of `stack` is unchanged or modified accordingly.***
