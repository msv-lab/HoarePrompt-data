Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr` at `index`, and `index` is incremented by 1. If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the function checks if `stack` is empty or if the top of `stack` does not match the corresponding character in `matching_pairs`; if so, it returns False. Otherwise, execution continues without a specific return value. If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, no action is specified.***
