Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of `expression`, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is not in `brackets`, and `char` is one of the values in `brackets`. The current value of `stack` is still an empty list, and either `stack` is empty or the character corresponding to the last element popped from `stack` does not match `char`.***
