Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `expr` that may contain various types of brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) and checks if they are balanced. It returns True if all brackets are correctly matched and closed; otherwise, it returns False. If there are unmatched opening brackets or closing brackets that do not correspond to any opening brackets, the function will also return False.**
