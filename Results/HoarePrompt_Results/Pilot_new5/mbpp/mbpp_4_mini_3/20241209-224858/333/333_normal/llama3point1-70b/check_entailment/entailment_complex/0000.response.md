Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to check if a given expression containing parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced.

Here is the explanation of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Stack Data Structure**: The program uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. This is a common approach for checking balanced expressions because it allows for the Last In, First Out (LIFO) behavior that is necessary for matching opening and closing brackets.

2. **Bracket Mapping**: The `brackets` dictionary maps each type of opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket, allowing the program to easily verify whether a closing bracket matches the most recent opening bracket.

3. **Iterating Through the Expression**: The program iterates through each character in the input expression:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it exists in the `brackets` dictionary), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it exists in the values of the `brackets` dictionary), the program checks whether the stack is empty or whether the closing bracket matches the latest opening bracket (the one at the top of the stack). If there is a mismatch or the stack is empty (indicating an unmatched closing bracket), the program returns `False`.

4. **Final Check**: After iterating through the expression, the program checks whether the stack is empty. If it is empty, it means that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets in the correct order, and the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it indicates that there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

5. **Handles Mixed Brackets**: The function correctly handles mixed types of brackets by maintaining a consistent use of the stack and the matching logic. It allows for expressions that contain various combinations of parentheses, brackets, and braces.

Overall, the program accurately checks for balanced expressions according to the requirements given in the problem description and handles all potential cases of imbalance. Thus, it is indeed correct.
