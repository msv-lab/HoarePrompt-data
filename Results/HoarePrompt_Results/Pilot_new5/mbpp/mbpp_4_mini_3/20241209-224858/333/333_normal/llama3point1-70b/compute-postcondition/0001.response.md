The code initializes a dictionary named `brackets`, which maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets. The variable `expression` remains unchanged as it is a string that may contain various types of brackets, and `stack` remains an empty list since no operations that alter it are performed in this snippet.

Output State: **`expression` is a string that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is an empty list; `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}**
