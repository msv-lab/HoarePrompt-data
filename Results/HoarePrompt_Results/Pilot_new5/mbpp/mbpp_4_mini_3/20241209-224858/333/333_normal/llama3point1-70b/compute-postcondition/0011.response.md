Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of `expression`, if `char` is in `brackets`, then `stack` is a list containing `char`. Otherwise, if `char` is not in `brackets`, `stack` remains an empty list, and if `char` is one of the values in `brackets`, the stack is not empty, and the character corresponding to the value popped from the stack matches `char`.***
