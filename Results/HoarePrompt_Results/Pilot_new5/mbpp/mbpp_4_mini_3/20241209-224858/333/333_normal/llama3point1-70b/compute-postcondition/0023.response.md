Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `expression`. If `char` is in `brackets`, then `char` is appended to `stack`. Otherwise, if `char` is in `brackets.values()` and `stack` is empty or the last character popped from `stack` does not match the corresponding bracket for `char`, the function returns False. If neither condition is met, there is no return value specified and the state of `stack` may remain unchanged or be modified accordingly.***
