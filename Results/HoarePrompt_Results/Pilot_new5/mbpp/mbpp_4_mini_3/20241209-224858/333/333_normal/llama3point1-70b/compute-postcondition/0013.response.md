The code `stack.append(char)` adds the value of `char` to the `stack`. The variable `char` is the second character of the `expression`, which is a non-empty string. Therefore, `char` has a specific value corresponding to that second character. If `stack` was initially empty, it will now contain that character. If it already had characters, it will contain one additional character.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the second character of `expression`, and `stack` contains the character `char` appended to it.**
