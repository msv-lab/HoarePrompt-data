Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr` at the current `index - 1`, and `index` is incremented by 1. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, then `stack` includes `char`. Otherwise, if `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the function checks if `stack` is empty or if the top of `stack` does not match the corresponding character in `matching_pairs`; if either condition is true, it returns False. If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, no action is specified and execution continues without a specific return value.***
