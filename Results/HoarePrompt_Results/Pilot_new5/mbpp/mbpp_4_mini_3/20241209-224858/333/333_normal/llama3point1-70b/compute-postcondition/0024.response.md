Output State: **`expression` is a string that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces, `stack` is either empty (indicating that every opening bracket in `expression` had a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order) or it contains unmatched opening brackets (indicating that there are unmatched opening brackets in `expression`). The function would return False if there is any mismatch between opening and closing brackets during the evaluation of `expression`.**
