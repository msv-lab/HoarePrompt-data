To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved.

1. The loop iterates over the variable `expression`. For the loop to execute, `expression` must be a non-empty string. If `expression` is an empty string, then the loop will not run.

2. The variable `char` will take on each character in the `expression` as the loop iterates. This means that at the start of the loop, `char` must be initialized to the first character of `expression`.

3. The `stack` is initially an empty list, which is fine since it will likely be populated during the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `expression` is a non-empty string and that `char` is initialized to the first character of `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of `expression`, `stack` is an empty list**
