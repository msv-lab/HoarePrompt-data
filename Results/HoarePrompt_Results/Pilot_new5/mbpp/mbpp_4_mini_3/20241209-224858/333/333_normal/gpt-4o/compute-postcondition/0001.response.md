The variable `matching_pairs` is assigned a dictionary that defines the matching pairs of closing and opening brackets. The `expr` and `stack` variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `expr` is a string that may contain various types of brackets, `stack` is an empty list, and `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys as closing brackets and values as corresponding opening brackets.

Output State: **`expr` is a string that may contain various types of brackets, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}**
