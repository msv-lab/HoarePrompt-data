Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1` to check if a given expression is balanced with respect to the specified types of brackets: parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`. Here's the reasoning for why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Bracket Matching Logic**: The program defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets. This ensures that whenever a closing bracket is encountered, it can be checked against the most recent unmatched opening bracket.

2. **Using a Stack**: The program utilizes a stack (a list in Python) to keep track of unmatched opening brackets. When an opening bracket is found, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is found, the program checks if the stack is empty (which means there is no corresponding opening bracket) or if the top of the stack does not match the expected opening bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`, indicating an imbalance.

3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters in the expression, the program checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, and the function returns `True`. If there are any unmatched opening brackets left in the stack, it returns `False`.

4. **Test Cases**: The program includes assertions that test various cases:
   - `'{}()[]'` returns `True` because it is properly balanced.
   - `'{}[}'` returns `False` because there is an unmatched closing bracket.
   - `'{}()[]()'` returns `True` because all brackets are balanced.

The handling of all potential cases regarding the balance of brackets ensures that the program adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description. Thus, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
