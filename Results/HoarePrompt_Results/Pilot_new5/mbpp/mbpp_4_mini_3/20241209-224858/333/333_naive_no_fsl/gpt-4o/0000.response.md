Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly checks for balanced expressions as described.

The function `func_1(expr)` aims to determine if the parentheses in the given expression `expr` are balanced. The following are the key points in the logic:

1. **Stack Usage**: The function uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets.
2. **Matching Pairs**: It has a dictionary that specifies which closing bracket corresponds to which opening bracket.
3. **Loop through characters**: The function loops through each character in the expression. If it finds an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it finds a closing bracket, it checks if it matches the last opening bracket from the stack.
4. **Return Value**: At the end of processing the expression, the function returns `True` if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets were matched); otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Test Cases Analyzed:

1. `'{()}[{}]'` should return `True`: This is a balanced expression (correct).
2. `'{()}[{]'` should return `False`: This is unbalanced (correct).
3. `'{()}[{}][]({})'` should return `True`: This is another balanced expression (correct).

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:

Now, we need to think of additional cases that are not covered by the provided assertions:

1. **Empty String**: An empty string should be considered balanced since there are no unmatched brackets.
   - Input: `''` → Expected: `True`, Actual: `func_1('')` would return `True` (correct behavior).
  
2. **Unmatched Opening Braces**: A string with unmatched opening braces.
   - Input: `'{[('` → Expected: `False`, Actual: `func_1('{[(')` would return `False` (correct behavior).

3. **Unmatched Closing Braces**: A string with unmatched closing braces.
   - Input: `'}'` → Expected: `False`, Actual: `func_1('}')` would return `False` (correct behavior).

4. **Nested Expressions**: Deeply nested balanced expressions.
   - Input: `'{[()()]}'` → Expected: `True`, Actual: `func_1('{[()()]}')` would return `True` (correct behavior).

5. **Mixed Characters**: Strings with non-bracket characters.
   - Input: `'{a+b * (c/d)}'` → Expected: `True`, Actual: `func_1('{a+b * (c/d)}')` would return `True` (correct behavior, assuming the function is only meant to check brackets).

### Conclusion:

The function correctly handles various edge cases and matches the expected output for all tests considered. Therefore, since I couldn't find a single case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **True**
