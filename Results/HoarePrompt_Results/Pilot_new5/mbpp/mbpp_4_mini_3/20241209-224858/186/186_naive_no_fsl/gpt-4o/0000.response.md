To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the assertions.

The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```
This function takes two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements from the two tuples using `zip`. The results are then returned as a new tuple.

Next, let's review the assertions:
1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` should return `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))` should return `(1, 2, 3, 0)`.
3. `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))` should return `(0, 9, 10, 0)`.

Let's evaluate each of these cases to see if the expected output matches the actual output of the function.

1. For the first assertion:
   - (10 & 5) = 10 (in binary: 1010 & 0101 = 0000)
   - (4 & 2) = 0 (in binary: 0100 & 0010 = 0000)
   - (6 & 3) = 2 (in binary: 0110 & 0011 = 0010)
   - (9 & 3) = 1 (in binary: 1001 & 0011 = 0001)
   - Actual output: (0, 0, 2, 1) → Expected output: (0, 0, 2, 1) – This assertion holds.

2. For the second assertion:
   - (1 & 5) = 1 (in binary: 0001 & 0101 = 0001)
   - (2 & 6) = 2 (in binary: 0010 & 0110 = 0010)
   - (3 & 7) = 3 (in binary: 0011 & 0111 = 0011)
   - (4 & 8) = 0 (in binary: 0100 & 1000 = 0000)
   - Actual output: (1, 2, 3, 0) → Expected output: (1, 2, 3, 0) – This assertion holds.

3. For the third assertion:
   - (8 & 7) = 0 (in binary: 1000 & 0111 = 0000)
   - (9 & 13) = 9 (in binary: 1001 & 1101 = 1001)
   - (11 & 14) = 10 (in binary: 1011 & 1110 = 1010)
   - (12 & 17) = 0 (in binary: 1100 & 10001 = 0000)
   - Actual output: (0, 9, 10, 0) → Expected output: (0, 9, 10, 0) – This assertion holds.

Now, let's consider edge cases:
- What if one of the tuples is empty?
- What if the tuples have different lengths?
- What if the tuples contain negative numbers?

Evaluating an edge case:
- If we call `func_1((), ())`, the code will produce an empty tuple `()` which is a valid return but it might not be in line with any implicit expectations from the problem description that may assume non-empty tuples.

Based on the analysis, the program does not handle the case of empty tuples or tuples of different lengths, which could lead to unexpected behavior or an error in a real-world scenario.

Thus, if the program fails to cover these cases, it indicates that the function is not entirely correct as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
