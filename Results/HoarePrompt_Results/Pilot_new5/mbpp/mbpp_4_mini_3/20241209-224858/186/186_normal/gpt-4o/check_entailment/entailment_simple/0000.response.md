Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." However, the implementation of the function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation on the elements of the two tuples instead of simply extracting the elements.

For example:
- The provided assertion `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` evaluates to `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is the result of bitwise AND operations on the respective elements of the tuples: `10 & 5 = 0`, `4 & 2 = 0`, `6 & 3 = 2`, `9 & 3 = 1`. 

The expected behavior according to the problem description would likely involve returning the tuples themselves or some other form of extraction, but not a bitwise operation. Thus, the function does not comply with the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
