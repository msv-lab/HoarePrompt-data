Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description requirements. The problem description states that the function must "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." However, the program is performing a bitwise AND operation on the elements of the tuples, which is not the same as simply extracting the elements. 

In particular, the program assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` contain numerical values that can be processed with a bitwise AND operation. If the tuples contain non-numeric types (like strings or other data types), the program will raise an error when trying to perform the bitwise AND operation.

In conclusion, the program does not fulfill the requirement to simply extract the elements from the tuples as specified in the problem description and therefore is incorrect.
