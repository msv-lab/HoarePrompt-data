Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description states that the function must "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." This implies a need to extract the elements from the two tuples in a way that combines them without any specific operation like bitwise AND.

However, the annotated program's `func_1` function uses the bitwise AND operation (`a & b`) on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. This is not in line with the problem description, which does not specify any operation to be performed on the elements of the tuples.

For instance, when the function is called with the tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected result according to the problem description would be something like combining these tuples in an implied manner (possibly by just returning them in some combined form). Instead, the function performs a bitwise AND operation which results in `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which does not reflect the nature of "extracting" from the tuples as specified in the problem statement.

Thus, the function's behavior diverges from the requirements set forth in the problem description.
