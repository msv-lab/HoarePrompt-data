To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze what the function `func_1` is supposed to do based on the description given:

**Problem description:** Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

The expected behavior of the function as inferred from the test cases is that it should extract elements from two tuples and apply a certain operation to them in a pairwise manner. The test cases suggest that the operation being performed is a bitwise AND (`&`).

Now, let's review the program:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

The function is using `zip` to iterate over the two tuples, pairing elements together, and applying the bitwise AND operation. The result is then converted back into a tuple.

Now, let's analyze the test cases provided in the assertions:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`:
   - (10 & 5) = 0
   - (4 & 2) = 0
   - (6 & 3) = 2
   - (9 & 3) = 1
   - Result: `(0, 0, 2, 1)`

2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`:
   - (1 & 5) = 1
   - (2 & 6) = 2
   - (3 & 7) = 3
   - (4 & 8) = 0
   - Result: `(1, 2, 3, 0)`

3. `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`:
   - (8 & 7) = 0
   - (9 & 13) = 9
   - (11 & 14) = 10
   - (12 & 17) = 0
   - Result: `(0, 9, 10, 0)`

Now, we must check if the function works for every potential case. The function uses a bitwise AND operation, which is not clearly specified in the problem description. The description just mentions "extracting elementwise," which could imply different types of operations, such as addition, multiplication, or even concatenation for tuples.

Since the problem description does not specify that a bitwise AND operation should be used, it implies that the interpretation of elementwise extraction is not correctly defined in the implementation. The function may not work correctly if a specific operation was intended that is not the bitwise AND.

Thus, we can infer that the implementation does not fulfill the problem description's requirements correctly.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not explicitly state which operation should be performed on the elements of the tuples and assumes a bitwise AND operation without justification.
