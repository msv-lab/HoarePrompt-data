Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements between two lists. The implementation uses sets to determine the intersection of the two input lists, which is an efficient way to find common elements. The results are then sorted and returned as a tuple. 

The provided assertions for testing indicate that the function is expected to return the common elements in sorted order. Analyzing the functionality:

1. If both input lists are empty, the function will return an empty tuple `()`, which is correct.
2. If one list is empty and the other is not, the function will also return an empty tuple `()`, which is correct.
3. If there are no common elements between the two lists, it will return an empty tuple `()`, which is also correct.
4. If there are common elements, they are correctly identified, sorted, and returned as a tuple.

Given the above points and the provided assertions, I couldn't find any case where the code does not meet the problem description. Thus, the program correctly implements the requirement of finding shared elements from the given two lists.
