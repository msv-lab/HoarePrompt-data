To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether it accurately identifies the shared elements from two given lists.

The program defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are expected to be lists (or tuples) containing elements.
2. Inside the function, both input lists are converted into sets. The intersection of these sets is calculated using the `&` operator, which effectively finds the common elements between the two sets.
3. Finally, the result of the intersection is converted back into a tuple and returned.

### Potential Cases:
- **Case 1:** Both lists are empty.
    - Input: `func_1([], [])` → Expected Output: `()`
    - Actual Output: `()`
- **Case 2:** One list is empty, and the other is not.
    - Input: `func_1([], [1, 2, 3])` → Expected Output: `()`
    - Actual Output: `()`
- **Case 3:** Both lists contain the same elements.
    - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])` → Expected Output: `(1, 2, 3)`
    - Actual Output: `(1, 2, 3)`
- **Case 4:** Lists have no elements in common.
    - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])` → Expected Output: `()`
    - Actual Output: `()`
- **Case 5:** Lists have some elements in common.
    - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])` → Expected Output: `(2, 3)`
    - Actual Output: `(2, 3)`

### Conclusion:
In all examined scenarios, the function produces the expected output. The conversion of lists to sets ensures that the solution handles duplicates correctly and identifies unique shared elements.

Thus, I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
