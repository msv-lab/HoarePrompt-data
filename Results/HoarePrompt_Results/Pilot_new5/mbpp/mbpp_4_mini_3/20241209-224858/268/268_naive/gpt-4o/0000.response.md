Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the provided column index `n` is out of bounds for the matrix. For instance, if `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix or if the matrix is empty, the list comprehension `[row[n] for row in matrix]` will raise an `IndexError`. 

For example, calling `func_1([], 0)` (an empty matrix) or `func_1([[1]], 1)` (where `n` exceeds the number of columns) would cause the program to fail. Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not account for these edge cases.
