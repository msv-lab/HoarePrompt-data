Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, which represents the column index from which we want to find the maximum value. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function assumes a proper format of input where `matrix` is a list of lists, and `n` is a valid column index (0 to the number of columns - 1). This is validated in the comments, ensuring that the inputs meet the expected conditions.

2. **Column Extraction**: The line `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]` correctly extracts the elements of the nth column from each row in the matrix. This is done using a list comprehension, which is an efficient way to achieve this.

3. **Finding the Maximum**: The function then uses the `max` function on `nth_column`, which will return the maximum value from the extracted column elements. This directly fulfills the requirement of returning the maximum of the nth column.

4. **Tests**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests to check the correctness of the function with specific examples, confirming that it behaves as expected.

Overall, the function adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description for any valid inputs, making it a correct implementation.
