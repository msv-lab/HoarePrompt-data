Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in how the index `n` is being used to access elements from the rows of the matrix.

In the provided program, the function tries to return the maximum value from the `n`-th column using `row[n - 1]`. This implies that it expects `n` to be 1-based (where the first column is `n=1`, the second is `n=2`, and so on). However, the problem description conceptually uses a 0-based index (where the first column is `n=0`, the second is `n=1`, etc.), as indicated by the conditions `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`.

This means that when `n` is given as 1, the program will access `row[0]`, which corresponds to the first column instead of the second column, leading to incorrect results for the maximum value in the specified column. Thus, the program does not always align with the requirements specified, and it can produce erroneous outputs depending on the input.

To correct the program, it should use `row[n]` instead of `row[n - 1]` to accurately reflect the intended column extraction.
