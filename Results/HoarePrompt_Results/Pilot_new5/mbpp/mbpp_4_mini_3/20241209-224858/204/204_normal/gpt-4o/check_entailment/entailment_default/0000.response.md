The provided program aims to check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 31 days. The function `func_1` uses a set of month numbers that have 31 days and checks if the input month is in that set.

Upon initial inspection of the code against the problem description, the function seems to perform as intended for valid input values. It returns `True` for months that contain 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and `False` for those that do not.

However, the problem description does not address what happens if an invalid month number is provided (such as 0 or 13). The function does not include any checks to handle these edge cases and will incorrectly return `False` if a month number outside the range of 1 to 12 is given.

Now let's consider the output hints, which state that the function does not handle invalid month values and assumes that the input is always within the valid range. This confirms the potential oversight in the code where it fails to account for invalid month numbers.

Given that the program does not handle invalid inputs and does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically for edge cases where the month number is invalid:

Correctness: **False**.

The function fails to manage cases where the input month number is outside of the valid range (1 to 12), which means it does not meet the requirements of the problem description completely.
