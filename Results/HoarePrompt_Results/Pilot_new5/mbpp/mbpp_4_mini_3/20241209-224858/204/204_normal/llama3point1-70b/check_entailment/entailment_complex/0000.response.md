Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. While it correctly identifies which month numbers correspond to months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), it fails to handle cases where the input month number `n` is outside the valid range of 1 to 12.

For instance, if the function is called with an argument like `0` or `13`, the function would return `False`, but it is not specified in the problem description that the function should only consider valid month numbers. Therefore, the function does not adequately check for input validity and could lead to incorrect results if provided with invalid input.

Thus, the program does not adhere to the complete requirements of the problem description, as it does not ensure that `n` is always a valid month number.
