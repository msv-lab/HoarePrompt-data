The provided program correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(month)` checks if the given month number falls within a predetermined set of months that have 31 days.

Here's a breakdown of how the program matches the problem description:

1. **Valid Month Numbers**: The function assumes that the input month will always be a valid integer between 1 and 12, as stated in the annotations. It doesn't handle invalid month values (e.g., 0 or 13), but since the problem description does not require error handling for invalid inputs, this assumption is acceptable.

2. **Checking for 31 Days**: The set `months_with_31_days` contains the correct months that have 31 days: `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`. The function checks if the input month is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

3. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program test various month numbers:
   - For May (5), the function returns `True`.
   - For February (2), it returns `False`.
   - For June (6), it returns `False`.
   - For January (1), it returns `True`.
   - For December (12), it returns `True`.
   - For November (11), it returns `False`.
   
   All of these assertions correctly reflect the expected outcomes based on the description that specifies which months have 31 days.

Since the function behaves as specified in the problem description for the valid range of inputs, we can conclude that it meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
