Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality of locating the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list using the `bisect` module. The function `func_1` utilizes `bisect.bisect_right`, which returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

Here are the checks performed by the assertions:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, indicating that `6` should be inserted at the end of the list.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, indicating that `3` should be inserted between `2` and `4`.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, indicating that `7` should also be inserted at the end of the list since it is larger than all existing elements.

These assertions cover the required functionality specified in the problem description, and there are no edge cases missed in this implementation. The code behaves correctly for all tested cases and adheres to the requirements of the problem.
