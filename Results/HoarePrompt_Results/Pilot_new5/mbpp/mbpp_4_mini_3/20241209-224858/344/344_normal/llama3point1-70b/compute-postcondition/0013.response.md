Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, returning the index of the first integer in the list that is greater than or equal to the value. If all integers in the list are less than the value, it returns the length of the list. The function does not return any specific integers like 1 or 2 as mentioned in the annotations, and it only returns an index or the length of the list. **
