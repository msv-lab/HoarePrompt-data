To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Description
The function is supposed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order. This means that given a sorted list, when a value is inserted, the order of the list should remain sorted.

### Program Code
```python
import bisect

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4
```

### Analysis of the Function
1. **Functionality**: The function uses `bisect.bisect_right`, which finds the index where the given `value` can be inserted in `sorted_list` while maintaining the order.
2. **Behavior for Existing Values**: According to the problem, if the `value` is equal to an existing element, `bisect_right` returns the index to the right of the last occurrence of that value.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function will:
- Accept a sorted list of integers and an integer value.
- Return the index where the value can be inserted while keeping the list sorted.
- For equal values, it returns the index to the right of the last occurrence.

### Edge Cases Consideration
Now, we should consider edge cases:
- If `value` is smaller than all elements, it should return `0`.
- If `value` is larger than all elements, it should return `len(sorted_list)`.
- If `value` is equal to an existing element, it should return the next index after the last occurrence of that element.

### Test Cases
The test cases already provided:
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4`: Correct, as `6` should be placed after `5`.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2`: Correct, as `3` fits between `2` and `4`.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4`: Correct, as `7` should also be placed at the end.

### Conclusion
Since:
1. The function correctly implements the logic to find the insertion index as per the problem's requirements.
2. The output hints align with the function's behavior and correctly describe the expected results.
3. All necessary edge cases are addressed.

The program behaves as described for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
