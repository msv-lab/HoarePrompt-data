#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers in sorted order and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order, `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list`, and if all elements of `sorted_list` are less than `value`, the function does not return anything. If at least one element is greater than or equal to `value`, the function would have returned the index of the first such element, which would be less than `len(sorted_list)`.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of the sorted_list, which is equal to i, given that sorted_list is a list of integers in sorted order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, returning the index of the first integer in the list that is greater than or equal to the value. If all integers in the list are less than the value, it returns the length of the list. The function does not return any specific integers like 1 or 2 as mentioned in the annotations, and it only returns an index or the length of the list.
