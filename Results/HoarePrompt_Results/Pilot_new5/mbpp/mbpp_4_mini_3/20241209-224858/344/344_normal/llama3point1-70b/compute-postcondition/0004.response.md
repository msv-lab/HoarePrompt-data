According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `sorted_list`. If `sorted_list` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sorted_list` has at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must increase by 1, making it 1, and `sorted_list` must have at least 2 integers.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1, and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`.**
