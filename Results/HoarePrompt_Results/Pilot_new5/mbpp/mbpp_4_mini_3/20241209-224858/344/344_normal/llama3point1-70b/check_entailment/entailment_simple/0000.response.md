Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Iteration through the List**: The function iterates through each element in the `sorted_list`. 

2. **Comparison**: For each element, it checks if that element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`. 

3. **Return Index**: As soon as it finds an element that is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns the index of that element. This index represents the position at which `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

4. **Handling Values Greater than All Elements**: If the loop completes without finding any element greater than or equal to `value`, it means `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`. In this case, the function correctly returns the length of `sorted_list`, which is the appropriate insertion point at the end of the list.

Thus, the function adheres to the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios, including edge cases where the `value` is smaller than all elements, larger than all elements, or fits between existing elements. Therefore, the program is correct.
