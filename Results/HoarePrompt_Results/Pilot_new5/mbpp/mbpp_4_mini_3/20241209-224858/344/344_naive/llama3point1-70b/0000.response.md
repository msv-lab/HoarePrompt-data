Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly identifies the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the `sorted_list` and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified `value`. If all elements in the `sorted_list` are less than the `value`, it returns the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point at the end. This behavior is consistent with the problem description for all potential cases, including when the list is empty or when the value is less than all elements in the list.
