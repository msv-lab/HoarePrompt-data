Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order using `bisect.bisect_right()`. The provided assertions demonstrate that it accurately finds the insertion point for various values in a sorted list. 

For the inputs:
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`: The insertion point is 4 (after 5).
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`: The insertion point is 2 (between 2 and 4).
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`: The insertion point is also 4 (after 5).

The logic correctly identifies the position where each value fits in the sorted order, and there are no edge cases or missed scenarios based on the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is deemed correct.
