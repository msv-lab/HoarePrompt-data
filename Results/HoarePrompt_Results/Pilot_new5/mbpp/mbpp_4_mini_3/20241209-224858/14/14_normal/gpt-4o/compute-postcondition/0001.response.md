According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` contains at least one integer, the loop will execute. The variable `num` will take on the values from `arr` during each iteration. Since `seen` is an empty set, it does not affect the execution of the loop but will be used within the loop body. 

For the loop to be executed, `arr` must contain at least one integer, and `num` should be the first integer in the `arr` list during the first iteration. 

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `seen` is an empty set, `num` is the first integer in `arr`**
