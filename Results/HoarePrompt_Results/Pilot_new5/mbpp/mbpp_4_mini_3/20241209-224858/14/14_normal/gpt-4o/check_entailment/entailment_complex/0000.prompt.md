You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        
        seen.add(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from `arr`, the loop returns True if any integer in `arr` is duplicated, otherwise it returns False after checking all elements.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that there are no duplicated integers in the list 'arr' since all integers in 'arr' are unique as evidenced by the 'seen' set.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for duplicate integers. It returns True if any integer is duplicated within the list; otherwise, it returns False if all integers are unique.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
