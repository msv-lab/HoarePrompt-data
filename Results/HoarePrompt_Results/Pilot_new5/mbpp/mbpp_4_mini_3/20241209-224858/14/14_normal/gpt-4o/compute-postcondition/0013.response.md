The variable `num` is added to the set `seen`. Since `num` is already included in `seen` according to the initial state, the set will now include `num` again, but the state remains valid as `num` was present initially. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `seen` includes `num`, and `seen` still includes `num` after the addition.**
