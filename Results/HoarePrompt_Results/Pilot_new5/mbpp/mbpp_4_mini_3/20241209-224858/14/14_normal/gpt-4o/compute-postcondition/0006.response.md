According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If `arr` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, and `num` is the first integer in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 integers, and `num` will be the second integer in the list during the next iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `seen` is a set containing `num`, `num` is the second integer in `arr`**
