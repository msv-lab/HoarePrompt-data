`seen` now contains the integer `num`, which is added to it. The value of `num` is the first integer in `arr` and is not present in `seen`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers that has at least 1 integer, `seen` is a set containing `num`, and `num` is the first integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that has at least 1 integer, `seen` is a set containing `num`, `num` is the first integer in `arr`**.
