According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second integer in the list, and for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the third integer in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `seen` now includes `num`, and `num` is the third integer in `arr`.**
