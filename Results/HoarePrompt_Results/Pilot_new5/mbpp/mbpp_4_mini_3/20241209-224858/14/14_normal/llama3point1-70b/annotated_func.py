#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
    #The program returns True if the length of the list 'arr' is not equal to the length of the set of 'arr', indicating that there are duplicate integers in the list. Otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns True if there are duplicate integers in the list; otherwise, it returns False. It accurately determines the presence of duplicates by comparing the length of the list to the length of a set created from the list. No edge cases or missing functionalities are present in the provided code.
