Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the functionality to check for duplicate elements in an array of integers. Hereâ€™s an explanation of why it works:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input. It initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of the numbers encountered during iteration.

2. **Duplicate Check**: For each number in `arr`, it checks if the number is already in the `seen` set. If it is, that means a duplicate has been found, and the function returns `True`.

3. **No Duplicates**: If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it adds the number to the set and continues. If no duplicates are found after checking all numbers, it returns `False`.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided test various scenarios:
   - A list with unique elements returns `False`.
   - A list with one duplicate returns `True`.
   - A list with multiple duplicates also returns `True`.

The function handles all tested cases correctly. Since I cannot think of any potential cases where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
