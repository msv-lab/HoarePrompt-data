Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively checks each element in the `nested_list`. If an element is a list, it calls itself to flatten that list and extends the `flat_list` with the returned values. If the element is not a list, it simply appends it to `flat_list`. This approach correctly handles all cases, including deeply nested lists and varying levels of nesting.
