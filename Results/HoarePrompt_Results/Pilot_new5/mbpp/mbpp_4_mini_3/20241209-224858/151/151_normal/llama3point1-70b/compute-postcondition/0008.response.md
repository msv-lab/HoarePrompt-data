To assess the impact of the code on the program's state, we note that the code extends the `flat_list` with the results of `func_1(i)`, where `i` is presumably the second element of `nested_list`. The exact behavior will depend on whether this second element is itself a list.

If the second element of `nested_list` (i.e., `nested_list[1]`) is a list, then `flat_list` will be updated with the elements returned by `func_1(nested_list[1])`. If it is not a list, `flat_list` will be updated with that second element directly.

Output State: **`flat_list` is updated by extending it with elements from `func_1(nested_list[1])` if `nested_list[1]` is a list; otherwise, it is updated to include `nested_list[1]`. `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements.**
