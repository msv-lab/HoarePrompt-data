Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the task of flattening a nested list structure as outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a list (`nested_list`) that can contain other lists or non-list elements. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Recursive Flattening**: The function uses a for loop to iterate through each element in the `nested_list`. It checks if the current element (`i`) is a list using `type(i) == list`. If it is a list, the function recursively calls itself (`func_1(i)`) to flatten that sublist, and then extends the `flat_list` with the result. This ensures that all nested lists, regardless of depth, are processed and included in the final output.

3. **Appending Non-List Elements**: For non-list elements, the function uses `flat_list.append(i)` to add them directly to the flat list. This means that all non-list elements in the structure are captured.

4. **Output**: After processing all elements, the function returns `flat_list`, which contains all the non-list elements and the elements from any sublists in a single, flat list. If the input `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` will also be empty, fulfilling the requirement that an empty input returns an empty output.

Overall, the function adheres strictly to the requirements of flattening the nested list, ensuring that every element is included in the output without preserving any nested structure. Thus, it effectively meets the problem description.
