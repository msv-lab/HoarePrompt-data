According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least 2 items, the loop can execute again for the second item. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 1 item, and `item` is the current item being processed. For the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must contain at least 2 items and `item` would be the second item in `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 items, item is the second item in the list, flat_list is equal to the result of func_1(item) if item is a list, or the first element of nested_list if item is not a list**
