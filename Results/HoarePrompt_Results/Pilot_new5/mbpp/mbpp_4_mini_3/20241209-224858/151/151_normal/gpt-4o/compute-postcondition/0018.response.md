Functionality: ** The function accepts a list called `nested_list`, which may contain integers and/or other nested lists. It recursively flattens the structure, returning a single list (`flat_list`) that contains all integers extracted from `nested_list` and its nested lists. If `nested_list` is empty or contains no integers, the function returns an empty list. **
