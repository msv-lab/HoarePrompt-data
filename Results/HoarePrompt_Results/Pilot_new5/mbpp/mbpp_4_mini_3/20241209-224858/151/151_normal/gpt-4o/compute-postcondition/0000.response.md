The code initializes `flat_list` as an empty list. The `nested_list` can contain integers and/or other lists, but since no operations are performed on `nested_list` in the provided code, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `flat_list`, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`nested_list` can be a list containing integers and/or other lists, potentially nested to multiple levels; `flat_list` is an empty list.**
