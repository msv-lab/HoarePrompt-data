The variable `flat_list` is updated by appending the value of `i`, which is the next element in `nested_list`. Given that `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, the value of `i` is valid and taken from the structure of `nested_list`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`flat_list` is updated with the next element `i` from `nested_list`, `nested_list` has at least 2 elements**.
