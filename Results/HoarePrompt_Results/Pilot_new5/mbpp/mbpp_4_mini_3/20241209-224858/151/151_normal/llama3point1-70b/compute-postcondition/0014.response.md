Postcondition: ***`flat_list` is updated based on the type of the second element in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, `flat_list` is updated based on the output of `func_1(i)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` is updated with the next element `i` from `nested_list`, and `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements in both cases.***
