The function `func_1(item)` is called with `item`, which is a list. The output of this function call is extended to `flat_list`, which is initially an empty list. The values of `nested_list` and `item` are not affected by this operation, but the output state of `flat_list` will now include the elements returned from `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 item; `flat_list` is equal to the result of `func_1(item)`; `item` is the first element of the `nested_list` and is a list.**
