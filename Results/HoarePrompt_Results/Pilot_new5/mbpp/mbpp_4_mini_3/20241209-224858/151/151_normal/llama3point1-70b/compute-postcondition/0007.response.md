According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `flat_list` is populated based on the first element of `nested_list`, and `nested_list` has at least 1 element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will be the second element of `nested_list`.

State: **`flat_list` is a list. If the second element of `nested_list` is a list, then `flat_list` must contain the elements returned by `func_1` for that element. If it is not a list, then `flat_list` must contain the second element. `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements.**
