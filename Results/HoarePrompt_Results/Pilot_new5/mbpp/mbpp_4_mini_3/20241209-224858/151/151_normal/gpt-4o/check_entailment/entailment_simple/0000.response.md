Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to flatten a given nested list structure. Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. **Recursive Approach**: The function `func_1` uses recursion to handle nested lists. It checks each item in the input `nested_list`. If the item is a list, the function calls itself to flatten that sublist. If the item is not a list (i.e., it is an integer), it is directly appended to the `flat_list`.

2. **Handling Multiple Levels of Nesting**: By recursively calling itself for any nested lists it encounters, the function can handle multiple levels of nesting. This ensures that even deeply nested lists are fully flattened into a single list containing only integers.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `flat_list`, which contains all the integers from the original nested list structure in a flattened form. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains empty, which is the correct behavior as specified in the problem description.

4. **Test Cases**: The assert statements provided validate that the function works correctly for various test cases, confirming that it produces the expected flattened results for different types of nested lists.

Overall, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, ensuring that it will correctly flatten any nested list structure it receives.
