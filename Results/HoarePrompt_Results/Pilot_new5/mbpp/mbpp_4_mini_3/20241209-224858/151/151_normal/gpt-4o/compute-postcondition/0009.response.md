The `flat_list` variable is updated by appending the `item` to it. Since the initial state states that `nested_list` contains at least 2 items, the `item` is defined as the second item in the `nested_list`. The `flat_list` is either the result of `func_1(item)` if `item` is a list or the first element of `nested_list` if `item` is not a list.

1. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` will hold the result of `func_1(item)` initially, and now it will have `item` appended to it.
2. If `item` is not a list, `flat_list` will hold the first element of `nested_list` initially, and now it will have `item` appended to it.

The other variables, `nested_list` and `item`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 items; `item` is the second item in the list; `flat_list` includes the initial value plus `item`.**
