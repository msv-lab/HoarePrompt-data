According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is currently the last element in `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must still have at least 2 elements, and `i` would be updated to the next element in `nested_list`.

State: **`flat_list` is updated based on the type of the second element in `nested_list`, `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nested_list`**
