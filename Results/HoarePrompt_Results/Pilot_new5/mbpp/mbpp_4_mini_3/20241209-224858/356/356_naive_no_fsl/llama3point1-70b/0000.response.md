Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly remove all whitespace characters from the input string. The `replace(' ', '')` method only removes spaces and does not account for other whitespace characters such as tabs (`'\t'`), newlines (`'\n'`), or multiple consecutive spaces. 

For example, given the input string:

```python
input_str = "Hello\tWorld\nThis is a test  "
```

The expected output should be:

```
"HelloWorldThisisatest"
```

However, the program would return:

```
"HelloWorldThisisatest  "
```

This shows that the program fails to remove all whitespace, thus making it incorrect according to the problem description.
