#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that may contain whitespace characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
    #The program returns the string 's' with all whitespace characters removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns the string `s` with all whitespace characters removed. It effectively handles any string input, including empty strings, by returning it unchanged if it does not contain whitespace.
