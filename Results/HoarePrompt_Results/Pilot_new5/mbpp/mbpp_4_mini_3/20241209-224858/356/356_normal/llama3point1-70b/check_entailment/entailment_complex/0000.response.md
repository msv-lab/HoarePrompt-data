Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description as it only removes spaces from the input string. According to the problem description, it is required to remove all whitespace characters, which include not only spaces but also tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and potentially other whitespace characters (like carriage returns `\r` and vertical tabs).

The method `input_str.replace(' ', '')` only targets space characters and does not handle other whitespace types. Therefore, the function fails to meet the criteria set in the problem description for removing all whitespace characters from the string.
