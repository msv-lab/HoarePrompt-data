Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The implementation uses the `math.pi` constant for the value of \(\pi\), ensuring precision in the calculation. The program will work for positive values of `radius` and `height`, which are logical constraints for a physical cone. There are no edge cases presented in the problem description that the code fails to handle, such as negative or zero values, as the problem does not state that these cases are valid inputs. Therefore, the function adheres to the described requirements and produces the correct output for valid inputs.
