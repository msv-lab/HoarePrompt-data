Functionality: ** The function accepts non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of a cone calculated using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). However, if either `radius` or `height` is negative, the function would still perform the calculation without error handling, potentially leading to unexpected results, as the mathematics of volume for negative dimensions is not defined in this context. **
