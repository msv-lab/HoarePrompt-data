Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone. The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are stated to be positive floating-point numbers. 

The calculation performed within the function correctly implements the mathematical formula for the volume of a cone, and since the problem description does not impose any additional constraints or requirements beyond computing this volume, the function effectively fulfills the task as described.

Thus, the program correctly computes the volume of a cone for positive floating-point values of radius and height, aligning perfectly with the problem description.
