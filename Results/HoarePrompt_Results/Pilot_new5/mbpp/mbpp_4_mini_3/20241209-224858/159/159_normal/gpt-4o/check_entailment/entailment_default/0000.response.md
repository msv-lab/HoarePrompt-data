The function `func_1` is designed to compute the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. 

Initial assessment of the code based solely on the problem description:
1. The formula used in the function matches the mathematical definition of the volume of a cone.
2. The implementation seems correct for non-negative inputs for both radius and height.

However, potential edge cases arise:
- The problem description does not explicitly mention handling negative values for radius and height. If either value is negative, the current implementation will still perform the calculation, yielding an incorrect (and mathematically invalid) result for the volume.

Now, checking the output hints:
- The hints indicate that the function does not handle negative inputs, which could lead to unexpected results. This observation aligns with the initial assessment that negative dimensions for a cone don't have a defined volume.

Since the program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases (specifically, it does not handle negative inputs and would return incorrect results in those cases), we conclude that the implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function does not account for negative radius or height values; as a result, it could yield mathematically invalid volumes, which is not acceptable according to the problem description.
