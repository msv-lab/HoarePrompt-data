#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are positive floating-point numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are positive floating-point numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are expected to be positive floating-point numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius^2 * height. There are no checks for the validity of the input values, so if either parameter is negative or zero, the function will still execute but will yield a non-physical result (zero or negative volume).
