Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. While the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone when both the radius and height are non-negative, there is a critical issue regarding input validation.

The annotated comments mention that the function assumes the input values for `radius` and `height` are non-negative. However, if either `radius` or `height` is negative, the function will still perform the volume calculation without any error handling, potentially resulting in an incorrect and undefined volume for a cone with negative dimensions. 

Thus, the program does not satisfy the conditions of the problem description for all potential cases, especially when negative values are provided as input. This lack of handling for invalid inputs is why the program is deemed incorrect.
