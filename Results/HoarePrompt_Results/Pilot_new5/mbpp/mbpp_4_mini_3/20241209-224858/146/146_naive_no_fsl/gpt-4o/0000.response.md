To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and its behavior based on the provided problem description, which is to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

The function works as follows:
1. It initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list.
2. It iterates over each list (`lst`) in the input `list_of_lists`.
3. If the length of the current list is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and `max_list` accordingly.
4. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

Now, let's consider some edge cases that could potentially break the function:

1. **Empty Input**: If the input is an empty list (`[]`), the function would return `(0, [])`, which is a valid response since there are no lists to evaluate.
2. **Multiple Lists of Maximum Length**: If there are multiple lists of the same maximum length, the function only returns the first one encountered. For example:
   ```python
   assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) == (2, [1, 2])  # Here, it returns the first list of maximum length
   assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7]]) == (3, [3, 4, 5])  # This is correct
   assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) == (3, [1, 2, 3])  # This is also correct
   ```
   In this case, if the problem description requires returning all lists of maximum length, then the program would be incorrect because it only returns one.

3. **Single Item Lists**: The function should correctly handle lists with a single item:
   ```python
   assert func_1([[1], [2], [3]]) == (1, [1])  # Should return (1, [1]) since it returns the first list of max length
   ```

4. **Handling of Different Data Types**: The function does not handle data types beyond lists correctly. If a non-list item is included, it will raise an error. For example:
   ```python
   assert func_1([[0], "not a list", [5, 6]])  # This will raise a TypeError
   ```

Given the problem description, we need to firmly establish whether the function behaves as expected in all cases. Since the function does not handle the scenario where there are multiple lists of the same maximum length correctly (it only returns the first one), it does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
