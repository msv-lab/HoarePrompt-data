#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list can contain any type of elements.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns the maximum length of the inner lists in 'list_of_lists' and the first sublist from 'max_sublists', which consists of the sublists that have a length equal to 'max_len'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) and returns the maximum length of the inner lists along with the first sublist that has this maximum length. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will raise a ValueError due to the call to `max()`, which is not handled in the code. Therefore, it does not account for the case where there are no sublists present, which may lead to an error.
