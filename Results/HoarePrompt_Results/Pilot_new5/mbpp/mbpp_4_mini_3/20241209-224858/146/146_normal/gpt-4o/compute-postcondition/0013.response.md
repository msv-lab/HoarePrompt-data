The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`, which is the third sublist of `list_of_lists`. The values of `list_of_lists` and `max_len` remain unchanged, while `max_list` now holds a reference to `lst`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new assignment.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 3 sublists, `lst` is the third sublist, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, and `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
