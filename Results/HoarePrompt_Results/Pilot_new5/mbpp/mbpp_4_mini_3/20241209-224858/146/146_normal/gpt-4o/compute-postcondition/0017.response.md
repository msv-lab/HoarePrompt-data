The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying lengths. After executing the function body, it will return `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist, and `max_list`, which is the longest sublist from `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sublists and return the length and the content of the longest sublist, handling the case where the input list is empty. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, returns the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself; if `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list.**
