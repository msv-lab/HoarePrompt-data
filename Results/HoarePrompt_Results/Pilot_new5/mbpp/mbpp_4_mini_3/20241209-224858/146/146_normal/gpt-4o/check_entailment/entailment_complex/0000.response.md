Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the list with the maximum length from a list of lists, along with its length.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `max_len` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest sublist found.
   - `max_list` is initialized to an empty list, which will store the longest sublist itself.

3. **Iteration Through Sublists**:
   - The function iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - For each sublist, it checks if its length is greater than the current `max_len`.
   - If it is, `max_len` is updated to the length of the current sublist, and `max_list` is updated to the current sublist.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - After iterating through all the sublists, the function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.
   - If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_len` remains 0 and `max_list` remains an empty list, which is the expected behavior.

5. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided in the annotated program test various cases, including lists of varying lengths and edge cases, confirming that the function provides correct outputs as specified in the problem description.

6. **Correctness for All Cases**:
   - The function handles the scenario where the input list is empty correctly by returning `(0, [])`.
   - It correctly identifies and returns the longest sublist and its length for all non-empty inputs.
  
Thus, the implementation meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness statement is affirmed as **True**.
