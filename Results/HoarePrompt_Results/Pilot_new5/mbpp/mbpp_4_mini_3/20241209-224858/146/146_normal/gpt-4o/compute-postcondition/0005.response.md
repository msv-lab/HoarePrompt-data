The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. Since `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, which is greater than 0, this means that `max_list` will now reference the same list as `lst`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list that contains at least 1 sublist, `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, which is greater than 0, and `max_list` is equal to `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list that contains at least 1 sublist, `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, which is greater than 0, and `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
