The variable `max_len` is assigned the value `0`. This does not depend on the previous state of `list_of_lists`, which is still a list containing sublists of varying lengths. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths; `max_len` is 0**.
