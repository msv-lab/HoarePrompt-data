The program description states that the function should find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The provided code attempts to achieve this by calculating the maximum length of the inner lists and then returning the first sublist that has this maximum length.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Functionality**: The code uses `max()` to find the maximum length of the inner lists and a list comprehension to gather the sublists of that maximum length. It returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist that matches this length.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. If an empty list is passed, calling `max()` will raise a ValueError, which violates the requirement to handle all potential cases.

### Reviewing Output Hints:
The output hints clarify that the function is expected to raise a ValueError when the input list is empty. This aligns with the identified edge case, confirming that the code does not handle this scenario appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when the input list of lists is empty. Therefore, it is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

Reason: The function will raise a ValueError if `list_of_lists` is empty, which is not handled in the code and contradicts the expectation of correctly processing all potential input cases.
