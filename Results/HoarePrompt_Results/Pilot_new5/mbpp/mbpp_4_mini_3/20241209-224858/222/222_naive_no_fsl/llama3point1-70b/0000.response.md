Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the provided function only retains uppercase characters and ignores all lowercase characters and any other types of characters.

For example, if the input is `"HeLLo World"`, the expected output should be `"HWL"`, which removes the lowercase substrings. However, the program simply extracts uppercase letters, resulting in the correct output of `"HLW"` but does not satisfy the requirement of removing lowercase substrings from the original string.

Another potential case would be for an input like `"abcDEfGhi"`. The expected output, which should remove the lowercase substrings, would be `"DEG"`, yet the program would yield the output `"DEG"`, which does seem correct. However, since the requirement is specifically to remove lowercase substrings (not just leave uppercase), the definition is not met entirely, and thus the program is deemed incorrect based on the problem description.

Therefore, since the function does not follow the problem description correctly in all cases, the result is **False**.
