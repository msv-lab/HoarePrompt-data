The program description states that the function is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, upon reviewing the implementation, the code only retains uppercase characters and ignores all other characters, including lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation. The program's output will therefore not reflect the removal of lowercase substrings; instead, it merely constructs a string of uppercase letters.

Considering edge cases:
- An input string with only lowercase letters would return an empty string, which does not align with the problem description's intent of removing lowercase substrings, as it implies a specific action that is not performed.
- An empty input string would also return an empty string, which is correct but does not address lowercase removal since there are no characters to remove in the first place.

Next, examining the output hints, they correctly describe that the function returns a new string containing only uppercase characters. However, they do not address the specific requirement of "removing lowercase substrings" from the string.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description and does not handle cases properly where lowercase substrings should be removed.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not correctly implement the required behavior as it simply filters the string for uppercase characters rather than addressing the removal of lowercase substrings as described. For instance, the input "abcDefGhi" should yield "DGH" after removing the lowercase letters, but the current implementation produces "DG" instead.
