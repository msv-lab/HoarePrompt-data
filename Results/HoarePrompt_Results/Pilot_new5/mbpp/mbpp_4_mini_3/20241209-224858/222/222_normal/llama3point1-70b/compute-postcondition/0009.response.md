`result` is assigned the value of `result` concatenated with `char`. The value of `result` is already equal to the second character concatenated with itself, and `char` is the third character in `s`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `result` will be the second character concatenated with itself, followed by the third character in `s`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `s`, `result` is equal to the second character concatenated with itself and then concatenated with `char`.**
