To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider various potential cases.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to write a function that finds the second smallest number in a list.

### Provided Program:
```python
assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2
assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5
assert func_1([2, 2]) == None
assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None

def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function takes a list of numbers.
   - It converts the list to a set to remove duplicates, then sorts the unique numbers.
   - It returns the second element of the sorted unique list if there are at least two unique numbers; otherwise, it returns `None`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The first two assert statements check for lists with varying values and duplicates, which seem to return the expected second smallest number.
   - The last two assert statements check lists where all elements are the same, returning `None` as expected.

### Edge Cases:
We need to consider potential cases where the input might be unusual or where the function might have issues:
- An empty list `[]`: The function will return `None`, which is appropriate.
- A list with only one unique number, e.g., `[5]`: The function will return `None`, which is correct.
- A list with only two different numbers, e.g., `[1, 2]`: The function should return the largest of the two, which is `2`, but the function returns `None` as the second smallest number is not defined.
- A list with negative numbers, e.g., `[-1, -2, -3]`: The function should correctly identify `-2` as the second smallest number, which it does.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the situation correctly when there are only two unique numbers present. The intended behavior for the problem description requires returning the second smallest number, but it returns `None` in cases where there are exactly two unique numbers.

Correctness: **False**.

The failure case is when provided with the input `[1, 2]`, where the expected output is `2`, but the function will return `None`.
