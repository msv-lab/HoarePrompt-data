Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the list contains only one unique number. Specifically, the following test cases highlight the issue:

1. `func_1([2, 2])` returns `None`, which is correct since there's no second smallest number.
2. However, `func_1([2, 2, 2])` also returns `None`, which is correct as well.

The issue arises when the input list contains no elements at all, such as in the case `func_1([])`. This case is not handled by the provided implementation, and attempting to access `unique_nums[1]` will result in an "index out of range" error.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle all potential edge cases, particularly the empty list case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
