Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description by finding the second smallest number in a list of integers. Here are the reasons why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Requirements**: The function `func_1` assumes that the input `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements. The code first converts `nums` into a set using `set(nums)` to eliminate any duplicate values, which is appropriate since we want to find the second smallest unique number.

2. **Checking for Minimum Elements**: The function checks if `unique_nums` (the list of unique integers) has fewer than 2 elements. Although the problem states that `nums` has at least two distinct elements, this check is a safeguard. However, since the state of the program guarantees this condition, this check will not affect the correctness.

3. **Finding the Second Smallest Number**: The return statement `return sorted(unique_nums)[1]` sorts the list of unique integers and accesses the second element, which corresponds to the second smallest number. This is a valid approach given that sorting will arrange the numbers in ascending order.

4. **Correctness Across Cases**: The function will correctly handle any list of integers with at least two distinct values, as required by the problem description. It will always return the second smallest unique number from the list.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description effectively, as it accurately identifies and returns the second smallest unique integer from the provided list.
