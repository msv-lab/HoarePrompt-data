`unique_nums` is assigned the value of the sorted list of unique elements from the list `nums`, which contains at least two distinct integers. The value of `unique_nums` will be a sorted list of those distinct integers. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a sorted list of the unique elements from `nums`.**
