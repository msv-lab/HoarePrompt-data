#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #The program returns the second unique element from the sorted list 'unique_nums', which contains the unique elements from the list 'nums' with at least two distinct integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two distinct elements and returns the second smallest unique integer from the sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums`. If there are not at least two distinct integers, it returns None.
