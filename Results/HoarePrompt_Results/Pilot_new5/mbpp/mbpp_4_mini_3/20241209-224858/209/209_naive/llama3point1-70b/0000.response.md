Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where any of the sublists is empty. For example, if the input is `[[], [1, 2], [3]]`, the program will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `sublist[0]` in the empty sublist. Therefore, there is a potential case where the program does not work as expected, making it incorrect.
