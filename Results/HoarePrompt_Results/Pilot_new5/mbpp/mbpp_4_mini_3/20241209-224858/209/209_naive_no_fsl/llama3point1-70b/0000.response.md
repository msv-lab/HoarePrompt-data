Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. If an empty sublist is provided, attempting to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. For example, calling `func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4]])` would result in an error, as the first sublist is empty and there is no first element to return. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
