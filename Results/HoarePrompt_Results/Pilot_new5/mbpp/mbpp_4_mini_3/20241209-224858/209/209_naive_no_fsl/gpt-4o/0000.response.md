To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1(lst)` and consider its behavior with various input cases:

The function aims to return the first element of each sublist contained in the input list `lst`. The critical part of the implementation is the list comprehension, which iterates over each `sublist` in `lst` and retrieves the first element (`sublist[0]`).

### Potential Cases to Test:

1. **Standard Case**: 
   - Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`
   - Output: `[1, 3, 6]` (This case works as expected.)

2. **Different Length Sublists**:
   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]`
   - Output: `[1, 4]` (This case also works as expected.)

3. **Empty Sublists**: 
   - Input: `[[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]`
   - Expected Output: `[1, None, 3]` since the second sublist is empty. However, the function will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access `sublist[0]` of the empty sublist.

4. **All Sublists Are Empty**:
   - Input: `[[], [], []]`
   - Expected Output: `[]`, but this will also raise an `IndexError` for similar reasons as above.

5. **Mixed Sublists with Empty Sublists**:
   - Input: `[[], [1], [2, 3]]`
   - Expected Output: `[None, 1, 2]`, but again it will raise an `IndexError`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle cases where any of the sublists are empty, leading to an `IndexError`. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement of getting the first element of each sublist for every potential case as described.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases with empty sublists, which can result in runtime errors rather than returning a valid response.
