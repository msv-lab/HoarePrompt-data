Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`lst`) and returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist. 

The implementation uses a list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` which iterates over each `sublist` in `lst` and retrieves the first element `sublist[0]`. Since the problem description states that each sublist is non-empty, the program does not need to handle cases where a sublist might be empty, making the list comprehension valid for the provided assertions.

The assertions provided demonstrate that the function produces the expected results for various inputs, confirming its correctness. Thus, the program fulfills the task as described in the problem description.
