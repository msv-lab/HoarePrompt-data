The function accepts a list of non-empty lists `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. However, it assumes that all sublists are non-empty, and if any sublist were to be empty, this would raise an IndexError. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all sublists are indeed non-empty.
