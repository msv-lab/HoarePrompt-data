The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of lists, where each sublist is non-empty. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist from the list `lst`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of non-empty lists and return a new list that consists of the first element of each of those sublists.
