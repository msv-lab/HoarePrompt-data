Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1). It does not handle cases where `n` might be less than or equal to zero, which would mathematically result in invalid outcomes, but as per the given constraints, it is implied that `n` will always be a positive integer. **
