According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. After the last iteration, `i` is 1. Given that the loop iterates from 0 to `n + 1`, the state needs to reflect the next value for `i`, which is 2, while ensuring that `n` is still a positive integer. 

Since `i` was odd in the last iteration, `sum` remains unchanged at 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be updated to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 2**
