Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements set out in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Specification**: The program specifies that `n` is a positive integer, which is in accordance with the problem description.

2. **Logic for Even Indices**: The for loop iterates from `0` to `n` (inclusive), checking each index `i`. The condition `if i % 2 == 0` ensures that only even indices are considered.

3. **Binomial Coefficient Calculation**: The use of `math.comb(n, i)` accurately computes the binomial coefficient for the given `n` and the even index `i`. This is the correct mathematical operation needed to fulfill the problem requirements.

4. **Summation**: The variable `sum` accumulates the total of these binomial coefficients over all even indices, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated sum, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description.

Thus, for all positive integers `n`, the program performs the required calculation as specified, and therefore, it is correct.
