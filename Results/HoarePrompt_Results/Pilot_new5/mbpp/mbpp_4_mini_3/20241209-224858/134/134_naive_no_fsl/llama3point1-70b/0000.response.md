To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1(n)`.

The problem description asks for a function that takes in a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The binomial coefficient for any given `n` and `k` is represented as `math.comb(n, k)`.

The provided program does the following:

1. Initializes a variable `sum` to zero.
2. Loops through all integers `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
3. Checks if `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`).
4. If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to `sum`.
5. Finally, it returns the calculated `sum`.

Now, we need to consider the potential edge cases. The following important considerations arise:

- The function correctly calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices for the specified range (0 to `n`).
- The program handles all positive integers `n`, including the smallest case where `n = 1`. In this case, binomial coefficients are `math.comb(1, 0)` for index 0 and `math.comb(1, 1)` for index 1. Only the even index (0) contributes, which is 1. The result is 1, which is correct.
- For `n = 2`, the even indices are 0 and 2. The coefficients are `math.comb(2, 0)` (1) and `math.comb(2, 2)` (1). The sum is 2, which is also correct.
- For larger values of `n`, the function continues to add all the even-indexed coefficients correctly as per the definition of binomial coefficients.

Since the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement, and every case I can think of adheres to the conditions set forth, I conclude that there are no missing logic or edge cases that the code does not handle.

Correctness: **True**
