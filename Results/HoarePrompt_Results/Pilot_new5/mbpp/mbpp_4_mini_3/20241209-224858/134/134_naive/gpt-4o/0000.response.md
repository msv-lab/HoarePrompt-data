To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the implementation closely.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes in a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

### Provided Program:
```python
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that returns `2 ** (n - 1)`.
2. It then has some assertions to test this function with specific values of `n`.

### Understanding Binomial Coefficients:
The even index binomial coefficients for a given `n` can be represented in terms of the binomial expansion. The sum of coefficients at even indices from the binomial expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` can be calculated using the formula: 
- For `n = 4`: The coefficients are 1 (C(4,0)), 0 (C(4,1)), 6 (C(4,2)), 0 (C(4,3)), 1 (C(4,4)).
- The sum of even indexed coefficients is 1 + 6 + 1 = 8.
- For `n = 6`: The coefficients are 1, 0, 15, 0, 20, 0, 1. The sum is 1 + 15 + 20 + 1 = 32.
- For `n = 2`: The coefficients are 1, 0, 1. The sum is 1 + 1 = 2.

### Calculation Check:
- The results from the assertions check out with the expected results based on the binomial coefficients' sums.

### Check for Other Cases:
To verify if the implementation can handle other cases:
- For `n = 0`: There are no binomial coefficients, and it should ideally return 0.
- For `n = 1`: There is only one coefficient (1), which should return 1 (since C(1,0) = 1).
- For `n = 3`: The coefficients are 1, 0, 3, 0, 1. The sum of even indexed coefficients is 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.

Given the above checks, we find:
- For `n = 0`, the function will not be defined correctly since it expects a positive integer.
- For `n = 1`, the function will return 1 but it's not correctly calculating based on the binomial coefficient logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the requirement to sum the even index binomial coefficients for all positive integers. Specifically, it fails to handle cases properly for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 
For example, func_1(0) is not valid since we expect a positive integer and does not implement the sum of even indexed coefficients accurately.
