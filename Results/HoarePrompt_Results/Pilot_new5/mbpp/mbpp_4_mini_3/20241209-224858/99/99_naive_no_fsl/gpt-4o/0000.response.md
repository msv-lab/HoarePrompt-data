Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. It defines a function `func_1` that removes characters from a string at odd index positions and returns a new string containing only the characters at even index positions.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the function:

1. It uses a list comprehension that iterates over the range of the length of the input string `s`.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is even (using `i % 2 == 0`).
3. If `i` is even, the character `s[i]` is included in the resulting string.
4. Finally, it joins the selected characters into a new string using `''.join()`.

The provided assertions confirm the correctness of the function for various test cases:

- For the input `'abcdef'`, it correctly returns `'ace'`.
- For the input `'python'`, it correctly returns `'pto'`.
- For the input `'data'`, it correctly returns `'dt'`.
- For the input `'lambs'`, it correctly returns `'lms'`.

Since I cannot find any counterexamples or edge cases where the function fails to meet the requirements described, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
