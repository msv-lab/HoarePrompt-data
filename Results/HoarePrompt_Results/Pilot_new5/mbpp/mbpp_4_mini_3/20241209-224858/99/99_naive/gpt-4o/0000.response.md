Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters from the string `s` that have odd index values. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string and includes only those characters at even indices (i.e., where `i % 2 == 0`). This logic is consistent with the problem description. The assertions provided also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various strings, confirming that it correctly removes characters at odd indices. Since I cannot find any case where the function fails to meet the requirements, the function is correct.
