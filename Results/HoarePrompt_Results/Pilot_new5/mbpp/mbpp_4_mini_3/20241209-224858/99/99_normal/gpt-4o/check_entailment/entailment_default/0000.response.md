The provided program is designed to remove characters from a given string that have odd index values. 

Examining the code:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
```

The code iterates through the indices of the string `s` and constructs a new string consisting of characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.).

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program logic seems correct for removing characters at odd indices, as it constructs a new string by only including characters where the index is even.
2. The code should effectively work for standard strings and produce the expected results as demonstrated in the assertions provided.

### Edge Case Considerations:
1. **Empty String**: The program should return an empty string when `s` is empty. This is indeed handled correctly since if `s` is empty, `range(len(s))` will result in `range(0)`, and the resultant list comprehension will be empty, giving an empty string as a result.
2. **Non-string types**: The output hints specifically mention that the function does not handle non-string types, which would raise a `TypeError`. The function does not have any type checking, which means if a non-string input is passed, it will indeed fail, indicating a lack of robustness.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints correctly summarize the functionality of the code:
- They state that the function returns a new string composed of characters from `s` that are located at even indices.
- They mention that if `s` is empty, the function returns an empty string.
- They also highlight the potential issue of passing non-string types, which is a valid concern.

### Conclusion:
While the function behaves correctly for the cases described in the problem (including handling empty strings), it does not account for non-string inputs, which causes it to fail when such cases are encountered. Since the requirement in the problem description should be followed for all potential cases, including edge cases, the program is considered incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle non-string types, which results in a `TypeError`, thus not adhering to the expectations of the problem description for every potential case.
