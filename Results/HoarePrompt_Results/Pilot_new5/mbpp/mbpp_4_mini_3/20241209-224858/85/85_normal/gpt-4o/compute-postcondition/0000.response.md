`min_val` is assigned the value of the minimum element in the list `arr`. Since `arr` contains integers, `min_val` will hold the smallest integer from that list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer in `arr`.**
