The variable `max_val` is assigned the value of the maximum element in the list `arr`. The state of `min_val` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Since `max_val` is now determined by the contents of `arr`, it will be equal to the maximum integer found within that list.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum integer in `arr`.**
