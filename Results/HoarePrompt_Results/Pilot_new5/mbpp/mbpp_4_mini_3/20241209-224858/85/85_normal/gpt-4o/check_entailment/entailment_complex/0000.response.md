Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly calculates the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values in a list of integers, it does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function must find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, which implies that the function should define behavior for empty lists as well. 

The assertion in the annotations assumes that `arr` will always contain at least two elements. However, if an empty list or a list with a single element is passed to `func_1`, it will raise a `ValueError` due to the use of `min()` and `max()`. Therefore, the function does not correctly address all potential cases as required by the problem description. 

Thus, it is incorrect, as it fails to provide a valid output or handle input cases that fall outside the expected range.
