Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Finding Maximum and Minimum**: The function uses `max(arr)` to find the maximum value in the array and `min(arr)` to find the minimum value. This is a valid approach to find the maximum difference between any two elements since the maximum difference in a set of numbers is achieved by subtracting the smallest number from the largest number.

2. **Calculation of Difference**: The expression `max(arr) - min(arr)` directly computes the difference between these two values, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program will correctly handle arrays of different lengths. For example:
   - For an array with only one element, the difference will be `0` (e.g., `arr = [5]` results in `5 - 5 = 0`).
   - For an empty array, invoking `max` or `min` would raise a `ValueError`, which is a limitation of the function but does not break the correctness for a valid input array.

In conclusion, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for any valid input array that has at least two integers. Thus, we can confirm that the program is correct.
