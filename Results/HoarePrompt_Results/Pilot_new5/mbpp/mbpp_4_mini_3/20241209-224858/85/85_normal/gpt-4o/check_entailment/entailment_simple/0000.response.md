Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

### Explanation:

1. **Finding Minimum and Maximum Values**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest element (`min_val`) in the array.
   - It uses the built-in `max()` function to find the largest element (`max_val`) in the array.

2. **Calculating Maximum Difference**:
   - The maximum difference between any two elements in the array is calculated as `max_val - min_val`, which is correctly stored in the variable `max_diff`.

3. **Returning the Result**:
   - The function returns this `max_diff`, which represents the maximum difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the array.

### Verification:
- The assertions provided in the program test various cases:
  - For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `5`, leading to a maximum difference of `4`.
  - For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `9`, leading to a difference of `8`.
  - For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `3`, leading to a difference of `2`.

Since the function handles the requirement of finding the maximum difference correctly for all tested cases and follows the logic outlined in the problem description, we conclude that it meets the specifications required.
