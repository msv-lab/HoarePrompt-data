Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then subtracting the minimum from the maximum. The provided test cases confirm that it works accurately for those inputs. Additionally, there are no edge cases that the program fails to handle, such as arrays with negative numbers or when all elements are the same, as the logic of finding the min and max will still yield a correct max difference of 0 in such cases.
