Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and returns the total number of occurrences of each element in `elements` that is found in `tup`. If an element in `elements` does not exist in the tuple, it contributes zero to the count. The function performs a count for each unique element in `elements`, leading to a final count that reflects the total occurrences in `tup`. **
