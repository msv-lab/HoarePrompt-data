To assess the correctness of the provided code, let’s analyze both the problem description and the code implementation.

### Problem Description:
The task is to count the occurrences of all elements in a list (referred to as `elements`) within a tuple (referred to as `tup`). 

### Code Implementation:
The function `func_1` is implemented as follows:
```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```
This function counts how many times each element in the `elements` list appears in the `tup` tuple and returns the total count.

### Initial Assessment of the Code:
1. The use of `tup.count(element)` efficiently counts occurrences of `element` in `tup`.
2. The `sum(...)` aggregates the counts for each element in `elements`.
3. The logic correctly handles the case of elements that do not appear in `tup`, as `count` would simply add zero for those cases.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
Let’s consider a few edge cases:
- An empty tuple: `func_1((), ['a', 'b'])` should return `0` since there are no elements to count.
- An empty list: `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), [])` should return `0` because there are no elements specified to count.
- Elements in `elements` that are not in `tup`: For instance, `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), ['d', 'e'])` should also return `0`.

All the mentioned edge cases would return valid outputs as the code handles them correctly.

### Output Hints Agreement:
The output hints summarize that the function returns the total number of occurrences of each element in `elements` found in `tup`, contributing zero for any nonexistent elements. This aligns with the function's implementation. 

### Conclusion:
I have examined the logic of the function against the problem description and considered various edge cases. The implementation covers all described scenarios, and the output hints also align with the code functionality.

Thus, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly counts occurrences of each element in the list within the tuple, handling edge cases appropriately.
