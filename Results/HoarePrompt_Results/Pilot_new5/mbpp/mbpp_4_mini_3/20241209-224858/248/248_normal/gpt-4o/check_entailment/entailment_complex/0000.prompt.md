You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert a list to a tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]) == (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)
assert func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]) == (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)
assert func_1([58, 44, 56]) == (58, 44, 56)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)
    #The program returns a tuple containing the elements of the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns a tuple containing the elements of that list. There are no additional checks for the type or contents of `lst`, so if `lst` is not a list or is empty, it will still return an empty tuple.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
