Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description, which requires converting a list to a tuple. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `input_list`, which is explicitly stated to be a list of elements. This aligns with the problem description's requirement.

2. **Conversion to Tuple**: The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list `input_list` into a tuple. This is the exact operation requested in the problem description.

3. **Handling of Data Types**: The annotations confirm that the function handles lists containing elements of any data type, which adheres to the problem description that doesn't impose any restrictions on the contents of the list.

4. **Direct Return**: The function directly returns the result of the conversion without any additional processing, which is acceptable as per the problem's requirements.

Since the program accurately and consistently performs the task of converting a list to a tuple without any conditions or restrictions, it fulfills the problem description correctly for all potential cases.
