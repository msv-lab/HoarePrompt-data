The provided code is a simple implementation of a function that takes a list as input and converts it to a tuple using Python's built-in `tuple()` function.

Upon analyzing the problem description, it clearly states that the function should convert a list to a tuple. The code appears to do exactly that by calling `tuple(input_list)`.

Next, let's look at the output hints. The hints confirm that the function accepts a list `input_list` and returns a tuple containing all elements from `input_list`, regardless of the type of the elements. There are no additional conditions or error handling mentioned in the hints, which aligns with the simplicity of the function.

Now, considering edge cases:
1. The function can accept an empty list and should return an empty tuple, which is handled correctly by the code.
2. The function can handle lists containing different data types (integers, strings, lists, etc.), and the `tuple()` function will create a tuple with those mixed types, which is also managed correctly.

Since the program correctly implements the specified functionality without missing any requirements or edge cases, and the output hints align with the code's behavior, we can conclude that the function behaves as intended.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly converts any list to a tuple, including empty lists and lists with mixed data types, fulfilling the requirements in the problem description. The output hints corroborate that the function operates as expected.
