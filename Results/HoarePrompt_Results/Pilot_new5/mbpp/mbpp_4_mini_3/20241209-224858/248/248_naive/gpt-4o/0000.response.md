Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The implementation is straightforward; it uses the built-in `tuple()` function, which takes an iterable (in this case, a list) and converts it into a tuple. 

The assertions provided in the program confirm that it works correctly for the specific test cases:

1. For the input `[5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]`, it correctly outputs the tuple `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`.
2. For the input `[2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]`, it correctly outputs the tuple `(2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`.
3. For the input `[58, 44, 56]`, it correctly outputs the tuple `(58, 44, 56)`.

Since there are no edge cases or scenarios outlined in the problem description that the function fails to handle, and it adheres to the requirements of converting a list to a tuple, the function is indeed correct for all potential cases.
