To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and its implementation.

The problem requires finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. In the context of this problem, "non-repeated elements" means elements that appear exactly once in the list.

Let's examine the implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

The current implementation uses `set(lst)` to create a set from the input list `lst`. This has the effect of removing all duplicate elements, and the sum of the resulting set is then returned. 

However, this approach does not correctly identify non-repeated elements. For example, consider the input:

```python
func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])
```

Here, the numbers `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6` appear only once, and their sum is `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`. However, the implementation returns `21`, because it sums all unique elements including `1`, which is incorrect as `1` is repeated.

Another example is:

```python
func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])
```

In this case, the non-repeated elements are `1`, `9`, `2`, and `45`, which sum to `1 + 9 + 2 + 45 = 57`. The implementation again sums all unique elements which incorrectly includes `10` and `4`.

Thus, the implementation fails to correctly identify and sum the non-repeated elements as defined in the problem statement.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program incorrectly sums unique elements instead of only non-repeated elements. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` should return `20` but returns `21`.
