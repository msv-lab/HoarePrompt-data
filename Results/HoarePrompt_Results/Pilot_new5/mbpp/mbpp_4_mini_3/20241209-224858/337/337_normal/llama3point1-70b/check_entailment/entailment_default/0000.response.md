To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze both the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem description:** The function should find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

### Initial Assessment:
The program uses a generator expression to iterate through the list and sums the elements that appear exactly once (`lst.count(i) == 1`). On the surface, this seems to correctly implement the task of summing non-repeated elements.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: If `lst` is empty, the `sum` function will return `0` since there are no elements to sum. This is consistent with the problem description, which does not specify a special case for empty lists.
  
2. **All Elements Repeated**: If all elements in the list appear more than once, the function will also correctly return `0`.

3. **Mixed Elements**: The function should handle cases where some elements are repeated and some are not, correctly summing only the unique elements.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe the function's behavior accurately, noting that it returns the sum of integers that appear only once and returns `0` if there are no unique elements. It also mentions that it does not handle edge cases related to empty lists, but again confirms that it will return `0` in such cases.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to implement the requirements of the problem description correctly for all tested cases, including handling empty lists and lists where all elements are repeated. There are no indications of it failing in any potential edge cases based on the provided description and hints.

Correctness: **True**.
