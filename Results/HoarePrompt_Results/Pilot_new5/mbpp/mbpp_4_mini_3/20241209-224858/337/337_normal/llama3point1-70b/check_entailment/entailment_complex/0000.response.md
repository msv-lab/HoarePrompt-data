Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst)` correctly meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function is designed to calculate the sum of non-repeated (or unique) elements in the given list `lst`. 

Here's how the function meets the problem description:

1. **Identification of Unique Elements**: The function uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to iterate through each element `i` in the list `lst`. It checks for each element whether its count in the list is equal to 1 (`lst.count(i) == 1`). This effectively identifies elements that appear only once in the list.

2. **Summation of Unique Elements**: The result of the generator expression is passed to the `sum()` function, which calculates the total of these unique elements. If there are no unique elements, the generator expression yields nothing, and `sum()` will return 0, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function is capable of handling edge cases, including when the list is empty. In this case, since there are no elements to sum, `sum()` will return 0, which is the expected outcome.

Overall, the function correctly implements the requirement to find and sum the non-repeated elements in the list, including handling the edge case of an empty list. Thus, it satisfies the problem description completely.
