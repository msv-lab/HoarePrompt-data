Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers (`lst`) as input and computes the sum of non-repeated elements within that list. 

Here's a breakdown of how it satisfies the problem description:

1. **Identifying Non-Repeated Elements**: The expression `lst.count(i) == 1` checks how many times each integer `i` appears in the list. If the count is exactly 1, it means that `i` is a non-repeated element.

2. **Summation of Non-Repeated Elements**: The generator expression `sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)` generates a sum of all integers that meet the non-repetition criterion.

3. **Handling All Cases**: The function processes each element in the list individually and sums only those that meet the condition. It does not skip any elements or ignore any potential cases, ensuring that all non-repeated integers are included in the sum.

Hence, the program adheres to the problem description and is correct in its functionality.
