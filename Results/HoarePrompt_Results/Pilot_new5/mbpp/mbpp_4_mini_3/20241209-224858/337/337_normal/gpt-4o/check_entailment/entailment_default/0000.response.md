To assess the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

**Output hints**: The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of unique integers in the list. If the list contains duplicate integers, they are only counted once in the sum.

### Initial Assessment
1. The provided function `func_1` utilizes the `set` data structure to convert the list into a set, which inherently removes any duplicate values.
2. The function then calculates the sum of these unique integers using the `sum()` function.

### Edge Cases
While the code appears to handle the core requirement of summing unique elements, let's evaluate potential edge cases:

- **All elements are the same**: For example, `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1])` should return `1`, which it does.
- **Empty list**: Calling `func_1([])` will return `0`, which is consistent with the expected behavior (the sum of an empty list).
- **Negative numbers**: For example, `func_1([-1, -2, -1, -3])` should return `-6` (sum of unique elements -1, -2, and -3).
- **Mixed positive and negative numbers**: For instance, `func_1([-2, -2, 1, 2])` should return `1` (sum of unique elements -2 and 2).

Given these observations, it seems the code should work for the above cases.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints state that the function will return the sum of unique integers in the list, which aligns with the implementation. 

However, upon deeper reflection, I noted that the function does not actually find the "sum of non-repeated elements," as the problem description specifies. Instead, it sums all unique elements, which include elements that may repeat in their original form. For example:
- **Input**: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4])`
- **Expected output** (considering only non-repeated elements): `1 + 4 = 5`
- **Actual output**: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`

### Conclusion
The program does not fulfill the requirement to sum only the non-repeated elements. Since it does not handle the specified case where elements may repeat correctly by excluding them entirely from the sum, the program fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation
The program does not correctly implement the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements, as it sums all unique elements instead. For example, an input like `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]` would yield an incorrect result.
