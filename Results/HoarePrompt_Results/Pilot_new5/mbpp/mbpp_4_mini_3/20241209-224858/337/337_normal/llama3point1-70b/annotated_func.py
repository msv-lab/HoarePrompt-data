#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of integers in the list 'lst' that appear only once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of integers that appear only once in the list. If all integers appear more than once, it returns 0. The function does not handle any edge cases related to empty lists, but in that case, it will return 0 as well since there are no unique elements to sum.
