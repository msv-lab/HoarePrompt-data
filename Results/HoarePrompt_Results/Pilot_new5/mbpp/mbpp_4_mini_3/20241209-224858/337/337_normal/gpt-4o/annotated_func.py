#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
    #The program returns the sum of unique integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of unique integers in the list. If the list contains duplicate integers, they are only counted once in the sum.
