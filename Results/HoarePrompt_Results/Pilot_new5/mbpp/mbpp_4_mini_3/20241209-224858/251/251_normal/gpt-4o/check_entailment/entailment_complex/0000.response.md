Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the edge case where both `x` and `y` are zero. In such a situation, the value of `r` would be `0`, and `theta` is undefined since `atan2(0, 0)` can lead to ambiguity. While the program may return `(0, 0)` without raising an error, this is not a valid polar coordinate representation because polar coordinates cannot represent the angle when the radius is zero. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, specifically when the input coordinates are at the origin (0, 0).
