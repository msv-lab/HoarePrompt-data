To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we start by analyzing the code against the problem description.

**Problem Description:** The function should convert rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, theta), where:
- r is the distance from the origin, calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of x and y.
- theta is the angle in radians, calculated using the arctangent of y divided by x.

**Program:**
```python
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, theta)
```
The function `func_1` computes:
- `r` correctly using `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`.
- `theta` using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which handles cases where `x` is zero properly, providing the angle in the correct quadrant.

Next, we consider the output hints:
- The function accepts two real numbers, `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates, and returns the polar coordinates `(r, theta)`.
- The output hints also mention that there are no edge cases handled for `x` or `y` being `0`, but states that the function correctly calculates and returns values even in these cases.

**Edge Cases:**
1. When both `x` and `y` are `0`: The value of `r` would be `0`, and `theta` would be `0` as well. Using `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns `0`, which is an acceptable representation of the angle when at the origin. So, this case is handled correctly.
2. When only one of `x` or `y` is zero: `theta` will still be calculated correctly:
   - If `x = 0` and `y > 0`, `theta` should equal `pi/2`.
   - If `x = 0` and `y < 0`, `theta` should equal `-pi/2`.
   - If `y = 0`, `theta` will be `0` if `x > 0` or `pi` if `x < 0`.

The function handles these edge cases correctly, as `math.atan2` is designed to handle the quadrants and the case of `0`.

Now we conclude that the output hints align with the function's logic:
- The function returns polar coordinates as expected for all possible real inputs. The hints about potential undefined situations do not match the actual behavior of `math.atan2`, which handles them gracefully.

Given this analysis, and since the function adheres to the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately, we can confidently say:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly computes the polar coordinates for all potential inputs as described.
