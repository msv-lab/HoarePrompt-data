#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, theta
    #The program returns the polar coordinates (r, theta) where r is the square root of x and theta is the angle obtained from the arctangent of y divided by x.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two real numbers, `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates, and returns the polar coordinates `(r, theta)`, where `r` is the distance from the origin calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and `theta` is the angle in radians calculated using the arctangent of `y` divided by `x`. There are no edge cases handled for `x` or `y` being `0`, which could potentially lead to a situation where `theta` is undefined when both are zero, but in practice, the function correctly calculates and returns values even in these cases.
