Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge case where both `x` and `y` are zero. In polar coordinates, the angle (phi) is undefined when the point is at the origin (0, 0). While the function correctly calculates the hypotenuse (r) as zero when both coordinates are zero, it does not address the undefined nature of the angle at this point, which means the function could return unexpected results in this specific case. Thus, it fails to fully meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
