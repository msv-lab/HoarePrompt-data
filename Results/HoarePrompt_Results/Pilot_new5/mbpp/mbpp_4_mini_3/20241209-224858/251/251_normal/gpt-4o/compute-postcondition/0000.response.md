The variable `r` is assigned the value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates, `r` is a non-negative real number that represents the distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates; `r` is math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)**.**
