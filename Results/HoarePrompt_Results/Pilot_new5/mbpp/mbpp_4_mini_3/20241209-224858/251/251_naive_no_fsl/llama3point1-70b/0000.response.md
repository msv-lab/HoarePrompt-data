Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(x, y)` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi) as specified in the problem description. 

1. The function correctly calculates the radial coordinate `r` using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which returns the distance from the origin to the point (x, y).
2. The angle `phi` is computed using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). This function correctly handles the quadrant of the input coordinates.
3. The return value is a tuple (r, phi) which matches the expected format for polar coordinates.

I cannot identify any edge cases or scenarios where the function would not behave as expected based on the problem description. It handles all quadrants and the origin correctly. Thus, the program is correct for all potential inputs.
