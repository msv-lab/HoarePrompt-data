#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, L):
    return lst[:L], lst[L:]
    #The program returns a tuple containing the first L elements of the list 'lst' and the remaining elements from index L to the end of the list, where L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. It returns a tuple consisting of the first `L` elements of the list `lst` and the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list. If `L` is 0, it returns a tuple with an empty list and the entire original list. If `L` equals the length of `lst`, it returns a tuple with the entire list in the first element and an empty list as the second element.
