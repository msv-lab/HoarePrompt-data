Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Requirements**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, with the annotation stating that `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. This ensures that the function is called with valid parameters that can be handled without causing errors.

2. **Functionality**: The function splits the list into two parts:
   - The first part consists of the first `L` elements from the list (`lst[:L]`).
   - The second part consists of the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list (`lst[L:]`).
   This functionality directly aligns with the requirement to split the list into two parts based on the integer `L`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `L` is `0`, `lst[:0]` results in an empty list, and `lst[0:]` returns the entire original list. Thus, it correctly returns a tuple of an empty list and the original list.
   - If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, `lst[:L]` results in the entire list, and `lst[L:]` gives an empty list. Thus, it correctly returns a tuple with the entire list in the first element and an empty list as the second element.

Overall, the program adheres to the specified functionality of splitting the list and handling edge cases correctly, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
