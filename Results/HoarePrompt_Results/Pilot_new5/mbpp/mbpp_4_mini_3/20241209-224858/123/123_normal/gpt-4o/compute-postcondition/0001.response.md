The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements, and a parameter `L`, which is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len}(lst)\). After executing the function body, it returns a tuple consisting of two lists: the first list is a slice of `lst` from the beginning up to index `L`, and the second list is a slice of `lst` from index `L` to the end. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple containing two lists: the first is a slice of `lst` from the beginning up to index `L`, and the second is a slice of `lst` from index `L` to the end.**
