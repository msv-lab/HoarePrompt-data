To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the provided function and the description.

### Problem Description:
The function should take in a list and an integer L, then split the list into two parts:
1. The first part should have a length of L.
2. The second part should contain the remaining elements of the list.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

### Testing the Code Against the Description:

1. **Normal Cases:**
   - If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `L = 2`, the expected output is `([1, 2], [3, 4])`. The code produces this output correctly.
   - If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `L = 0`, the expected output is `([], [1, 2, 3, 4])`. The code also produces this output correctly.
   - If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `L = 4`, the expected output is `([1, 2, 3, 4], [])`. The code produces this output correctly.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `lst = []` (an empty list) and `L = 0`, the expected output is `([], [])`. The code produces this output correctly.
   - If `lst = []` and `L = 1`, the expected output should logically be `([], [])` since the list is empty. The code also produces this output correctly.
   - If `L` is greater than the length of the list (e.g., `lst = [1, 2]` and `L = 3`), the expected output would be `([1, 2], [])`, which the code handles correctly by slicing beyond the list length.

### Conclusion:
After testing various inputs including edge cases, the function `func_1` consistently produces the expected results according to the problem description. There are no examples where the function fails to behave as described.

Correctness: **True**
