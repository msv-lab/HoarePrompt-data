To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the description and the code.

**Problem description**: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
2. It uses list slicing to return two parts of the list:
   - The first part `lst[:L]` contains the elements from the start of the list up to, but not including, the index `L`.
   - The second part `lst[L:]` contains the rest of the list starting from index `L`.

### Potential cases to consider:
- **Case when L is greater than the length of lst**: 
  - If `L` is greater than the length of the list, `lst[:L]` will return the entire list, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list. This behavior is consistent with the slicing logic in Python, and it meets the problem requirement of splitting.
  
- **Case when L is negative**: 
  - If `L` is negative, `lst[:L]` will return an empty list (since slicing with a negative index behaves as starting from the end of the list), and `lst[L:]` will return the whole list (because negative indexing retrieves elements from the end). This behavior is also consistent with Python slicing. However, there is an ambiguity in the problem description regarding how to handle negative values for `L`.

- **Case when L is zero**: 
  - If `L` is zero, `lst[:L]` will return an empty list, and `lst[L:]` will return the entire list. This behavior is also acceptable according to the description.

- **Case when lst is empty**: 
  - If `lst` is empty, regardless of the value of `L`, both `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]` will return empty lists. This is valid as per the slicing behavior.

### Conclusion:
While the function behaves correctly for most scenarios, the handling of a negative integer for `L` can be seen as deviating from a strict interpretation of the problem description, which does not specify such behavior. Therefore, due to this ambiguity and potential unwanted outcome, I conclude that the program does not strictly meet the problem specification in every case.

Correctness: **False**.
