To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the program itself.

**Problem Description:** Write a python function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index `k` of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits.
2. It starts with `k = 1`, calculates the triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and checks the number of digits in this triangular number using `len(str(triangular_number))`.
3. If the number of digits matches `n`, it returns the current index `k`.
4. The function continues incrementing `k` until it finds a triangular number with exactly `n` digits.

**Test Cases Provided:**
- For `n = 2`, it asserts that the result is `4`. The triangular numbers are: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 (10 is the first with 2 digits, and its index is 4).
- For `n = 3`, it asserts that the result is `14`. The triangular numbers up to this index show that 105 is the first with 3 digits, at index 14.
- For `n = 4`, it asserts that the result is `45`. The first triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, which is at index 45.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. **n = 1:** The triangular numbers begin with 1, which has 1 digit. The function should return `1` for `n = 1`. The current implementation does not include an assertion for this case.
2. **Larger values of n:** The function should continue to work for larger values of `n`, but we must ensure it doesn't mistakenly skip or miscount triangular numbers.

Since the function does not account for the case when `n = 1`, and there is no assertion for it, the function will not return the expected index in that scenario.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails for the input `n = 1`, as it does not include an assertion or check for this case explicitly, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when the function is tested with that input.
