Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The program uses a loop that starts with `idx = 1` and calculates the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
2. It checks the number of digits in the triangular number by converting it to a string and measuring its length using `len(str(triangular_num))`.
3. The loop continues until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits, at which point it returns the corresponding index `idx`.

The program effectively handles edge cases:
- For `n = 1`, it will correctly find the first triangular number (which is 1) and return index 1.
- For larger values of `n`, it iteratively calculates triangular numbers until it finds one that meets the digit requirement.

Since the program covers all potential input cases correctly without missing any logic, it meets the specified requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is established as True.
