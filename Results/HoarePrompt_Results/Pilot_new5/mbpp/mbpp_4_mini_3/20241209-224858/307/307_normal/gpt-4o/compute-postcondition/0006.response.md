The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` was 1, so after the operation, `k` will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition about the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` not being equal to `n` still holds.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
