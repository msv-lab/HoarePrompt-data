The value of `triangular_number` is assigned the result of the expression `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 2, we can calculate `triangular_number` as follows: 

`triangular_number = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 * 3 // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`. 

The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is now equal to 1 (since `triangular_number` is now 3, which has 1 digit), and the initial condition states that the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits, this means `n` is also 1 since the length of `triangular_number` is now 1.

After this operation, the values of `n`, `k`, and `triangular_number` are as follows: `n` is still a positive integer (now specifically 1), `k` is 2, and `triangular_number` is now 3.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3**.
