The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` was 2, so after this operation, `k` becomes 3. The values of `n` and `triangular_number` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 1, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3**
