The code assigns a new value to `triangular_num` using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 2, we can calculate the value of `triangular_num` as follows:

- `triangular_num` = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2
- `triangular_num` = 2 * 3 // 2
- `triangular_num` = 6 // 2
- `triangular_num` = 3

The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state indicates that the length of `triangular_num` (which is now 3) is still less than `n`, as `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
