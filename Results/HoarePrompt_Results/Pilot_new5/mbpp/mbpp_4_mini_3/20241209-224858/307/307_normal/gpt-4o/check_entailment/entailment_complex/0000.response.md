Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index (or `k`) of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits. The triangular number for a given `k` is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

2. **Loop and Condition**: The while loop continues to iterate through values of `k`, starting from 1, and calculates the triangular number. It then checks the length of the triangular number (converted to a string) to see if it has exactly `n` digits. 

3. **Return Value**: When the condition of having `n` digits is met, the function returns the current value of `k`, which is the desired index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

4. **Testing**: The assertions provided in the code verify that for specific values of `n` (2, 3, and 4), the function returns the correct indices (4, 14, and 45, respectively). These assertions serve as test cases that confirm the function behaves as expected for at least these inputs.

5. **Scope of Inputs**: The function is designed to handle any positive integer `n`, and due to the nature of triangular numbers, it is guaranteed that as `k` increases, the triangular numbers will increase, allowing the function to eventually find a triangular number with `n` digits.

Overall, the function adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem description, ensuring that it will always find the smallest index of a triangular number with exactly `n` digits for any positive integer input.
