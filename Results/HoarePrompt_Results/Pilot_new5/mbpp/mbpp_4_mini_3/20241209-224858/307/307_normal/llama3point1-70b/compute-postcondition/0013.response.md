The variable `triangular_num` is assigned the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. The current value of `idx` is 3, so we calculate `triangular_num` as follows:

```
triangular_num = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2
               = 3 * 4 // 2
               = 12 // 2
               = 6
```

Now, `triangular_num` is updated to 6. The values of `n` and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6**
