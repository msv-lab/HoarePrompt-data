The value of `triangular_number` is recalculated to be `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 3, we can compute `triangular_number` as follows:

triangular_number = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2
triangular_number = 3 * 4 // 2
triangular_number = 12 // 2
triangular_number = 6

The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 1, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6**
