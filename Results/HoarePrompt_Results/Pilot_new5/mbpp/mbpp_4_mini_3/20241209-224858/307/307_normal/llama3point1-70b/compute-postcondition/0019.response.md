Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the index `idx` of the first triangular number that has at least `n` digits. It continues to calculate triangular numbers until one is found that meets the digit requirement, returning that index. The function does not have a cap on `n`, so it could potentially run indefinitely if `n` is excessively large and no corresponding triangular number exists within a reasonable range.**
