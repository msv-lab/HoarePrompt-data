The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits. After executing the function body, the function has multiple return points based on the value of `n`:

- In Case_1, the program returns the value of `k`, which is 1.
- In Case_2, the program returns the value of `k`, which is 2.
- In Case_3, the program returns 3, which is the value of `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return specific values based on certain conditions related to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns 1, 2, or 3 based on specific conditions.**
