The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number. Based on the value of `n`, the function can return different outputs: 

- If the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `idx`, which is 1.
- If the length condition is not met, the function returns an index value of 2.
- If neither of the first two cases is fulfilled, the function returns the value of `idx`, which is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return different index values based on the length of the string representation of the triangular number compared to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns 1 if the length of the triangular number is greater than or equal to n, returns 2 in the next condition, and returns 3 if neither of the first two conditions is met.**
