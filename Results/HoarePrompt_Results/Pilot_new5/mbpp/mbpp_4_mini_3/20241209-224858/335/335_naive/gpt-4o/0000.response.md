Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle multiple occurrences of the substring within the main string. For example, if we test the following case:

```python
assert func_1('python programming, python programming', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
```

The expected output should indicate the occurrence of the substring 'python' at position 0 with an end position of 6 for the first occurrence, but the program does not account for returning the position of the subsequent occurrence (which starts at index 23). Therefore, it fails to provide a comprehensive solution as it only returns the first occurrence. Because of this, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
