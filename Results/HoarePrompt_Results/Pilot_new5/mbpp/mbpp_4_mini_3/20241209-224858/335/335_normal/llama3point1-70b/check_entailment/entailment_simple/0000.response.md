Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here is a detailed explanation of why the program meets the criteria:

1. **Finding Occurrence**: The program uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring within the string. If the substring is found, it returns the starting index of the substring.

2. **Returning Position**: Upon finding the substring, the program calculates the ending index of the substring as well (the starting index plus the length of the substring). It returns both the starting index and the ending index (correctly adjusted to be inclusive), alongside the substring itself.

3. **Handling Absence of Match**: If the substring is not found (i.e., `start` equals -1), the function correctly returns `None`. This matches the requirement to return `None` if there is no match.

4. **Function Signature**: The function accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both of which are specified to be non-empty. This fits the assumption in the problem description, and itâ€™s clear that the function is designed to handle valid cases.

Since the program accurately finds and returns the occurrence of a substring along with its position, and it also handles the case where the substring is not present by returning `None`, it adheres to the problem description completely. Thus, the correctness statement is justified.
