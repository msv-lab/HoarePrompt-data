Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly finds the first occurrence of a substring within a string, it only returns the first occurrence and its positions. The problem description states that it should find the occurrence and position of "the substrings" (plural), which implies that the function should be able to find all occurrences of the substring within the main string, not just the first one.

Additionally, the expected output is a tuple containing the substring along with its start and end positions for every occurrence, but the program only handles a single occurrence. If there are multiple occurrences of the substring, this program will not return information about those, which does not fulfill the requirement stated in the problem description.

For example, if the input string is "python python programming", and the substring is "python", the program would only return the first occurrence, but it should also account for the second occurrence.

Thus, the program's logic fails to satisfy the complete requirement of identifying and reporting all occurrences of the substring, leading to its incorrectness based on the provided problem description.
