The program is incorrect as it does not fully comply with the problem description. 

According to the problem description, the function must find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and return None if there is no match. However, the annotations in the code state that the function assumes `substring` is a valid substring of `string`. This is a critical flaw because the program does not handle cases where the `substring` might not be present in the `string` correctly.

Specifically:
1. The initial comment states that the function is called with the assumption that `substring` is a valid substring of `string`. This is not guaranteed by the problem description.
2. If `substring` is not present in `string`, the function returns `None`, which is acceptable per the problem description.
3. However, if `substring` is present, the function correctly returns the `substring`, its starting index, and its ending index minus one. 

The contradiction lies in the assumption made in the annotations that `substring` will always be found in `string`, which limits the function's correctness. If `substring` is not valid (not a substring of `string`), the function would not behave as the problem description outlines.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for every potential case, particularly when `substring` is not valid.

Correctness: **False**
