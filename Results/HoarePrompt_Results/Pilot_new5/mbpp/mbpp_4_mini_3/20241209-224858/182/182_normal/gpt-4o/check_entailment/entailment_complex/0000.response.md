Correctness: **False**

The program does not always do what the problem description requires. While the function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character from each string in the tuple for non-empty strings, it will raise an `IndexError` if any string in the tuple is empty. The problem description does not specify how to handle empty strings, but since the function can potentially fail (through an unhandled exception) when encountering an empty string, it does not fulfill the requirement to safely extract the last character from each string. 

This means that in scenarios where the input tuple contains an empty string (e.g., `func_1(('Mers', '', 'Vers'))`), the function will raise an error instead of returning a valid output. Thus, it does not meet the problem description's expectation for handling all cases.
