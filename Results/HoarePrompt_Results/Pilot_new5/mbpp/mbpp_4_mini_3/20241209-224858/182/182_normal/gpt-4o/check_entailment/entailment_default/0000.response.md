The provided function `func_1` is intended to extract the last character from each string in a given tuple. The implementation uses a list comprehension to achieve this.

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The function correctly returns the last character of each string in the tuple as described in the problem statement.
   - However, it does not handle the case where any string in the tuple is empty, which would lead to an `IndexError` when attempting to access the last character of that string.

2. **Output Hints Examination**:
   - The output hints mention that if any string in the tuple is empty, it will result in an `IndexError` since there is no last character to retrieve. This aligns with my initial assessment that the code does not properly handle empty strings.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The function does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically the case of empty strings). As such, the output hints confirm this oversight.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not handle the case where one or more strings in the tuple are empty, leading to an `IndexError`.
