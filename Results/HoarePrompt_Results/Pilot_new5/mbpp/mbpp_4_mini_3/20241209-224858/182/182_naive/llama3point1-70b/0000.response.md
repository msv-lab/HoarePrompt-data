Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly extracts the last character (rear index element) of each string in the given tuple. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the tuple of strings and accesses the last character of each string using indexing (`s[-1]`). 

All potential cases appear to be handled correctly, including:
- Strings of varying lengths, including empty strings (which will raise an `IndexError`).
- If any string in the tuple is empty, the program will raise an error, as it tries to access the last character of an empty string.

However, since the problem description does not specify that the strings will always be non-empty, this could potentially lead to an issue when an empty string is present. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

The program should also handle the case where one or more strings in the tuple are empty, which it currently does not. 

Thus, the correct assessment should be:

Correctness: **False**. 

Example case where it fails:
- For input `("", "hello", "world")`, it will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access the last character of the empty string.
