Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character from each string in the provided tuple. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through each string in the tuple `tup` and retrieves the last character using indexing (`s[-1]`). 

All assertions provided as examples confirm that the function produces the expected output for those specific inputs. Moreover, no potential edge cases or inputs are apparent that would break the expected behavior of the function, such as empty strings or tuples. 

Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all inputs that can be reasonably expected.
