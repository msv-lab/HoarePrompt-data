The variable `first_char` is assigned the value of the first character of the string `s`. Since `s` is not an empty string, it will have a first character defined. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string that may contain any characters and `first_char` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string that may contain any characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`.**
