Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same. 

Here's how it works:
- The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
- It converts the string `s` into a set using `set(s)`. A set automatically removes duplicate characters, leaving only unique characters.
- By checking if the length of this set is equal to 1 (`len(set(s)) == 1`), the function determines whether all characters in the original string were identical. If there is only one unique character, then all characters are the same, and the function returns `True`. If there are multiple characters, it returns `False`.

This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which specifies the need to check if all characters in the string are the same. The function handles all cases, including:
- An empty string (returns `True` since there are no different characters).
- A string with one character (returns `True`).
- A string with multiple identical characters (returns `True`).
- A string with different characters (returns `False`).

Therefore, the program adheres to the problem requirements and is correct.
