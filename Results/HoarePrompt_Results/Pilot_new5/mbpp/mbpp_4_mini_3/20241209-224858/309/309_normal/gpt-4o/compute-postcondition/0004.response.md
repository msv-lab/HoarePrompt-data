To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variable `s` and its properties. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. 

1. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must not be empty. If `s` is an empty string, the loop will not run at all.
2. The variable `first_char` is specified as the first character of `s`. This implies that `first_char` must be defined and equal to the first character of `s`, which is only valid if `s` is not empty.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute:
- `s` must be a non-empty string.
- `first_char` should be the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s**.
