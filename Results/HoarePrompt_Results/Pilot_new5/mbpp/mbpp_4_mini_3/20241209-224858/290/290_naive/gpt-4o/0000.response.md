Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is designed to check if a string contains the character 'z' except at the start and end of the string. However, the program does not handle the case where the string has a length of 2 or less. For example, if the input is `'zz'`, the function would incorrectly return `False`, even though 'z' is present in both positions, violating the problem description. Another example is when the input string is just a single character, such as `'z'`, which should also return `False` as per the requirement. 

Thus, the function does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
