Correctness: **True**.

The program accurately checks if any words in the input string contain the letter 'z' except at the start and end of the word. It first splits the input string into words and then iterates through each word. The condition checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 and whether 'z' appears anywhere in the substring that excludes the first and last characters (i.e., `word[1:-1]`). 

This implementation correctly handles the provided requirements, as it:
1. Ignores single-character words.
2. Only checks for 'z' within the middle characters of words with more than one character.

For example:
- Input: "Fizz is a buzz" → Output: True (because "Fizz" contains 'z' in the middle).
- Input: "a z b" → Output: False (because 'z' is at the start and end).
- Input: "hello world" → Output: False (because there's no 'z').

Thus, the program meets the criteria set out in the problem description for all potential cases.
