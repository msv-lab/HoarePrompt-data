According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `words` list. Since `word` is the second word in the list and the loop iterates through each word, for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 words. After the last iteration, `word` is currently the second word. Therefore, for the next iteration, `word` needs to be the third word in the list, and the index should be updated accordingly.

State: **`s` is a string with a length of at least 1, `words` is a list of at least 3 words, `word` is the third word in the list**
