To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether the function `func_1` adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description. Let's analyze the program step-by-step against the requirements:

### Problem Description
The function must check if a given string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

### Annotated Program Analysis
1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.

2. **Checking for 'z'**:
   - The code `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` checks for the presence of 'z' in the substring of `s` that excludes the first and last characters. This is correctly aligned with the problem description, as it only checks for 'z' in the middle of the string.

3. **Return Values**:
   - If 'z' is found in the substring (i.e., between the first and last characters), the function returns `True`.
   - If 'z' is not found, the function returns `False`.

4. **Assertions**:
   - `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: This assertion is incorrect because 'z' is not in the substring between the first and last characters. The function should return `False`, but it returns `True` instead.
   - `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: In this case, the string starts with 'z', so this assertion is correct as the 'z' is not in the middle.
   - `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False`: This assertion is also correct; there is no 'z' in the string.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the requirements set by the problem description due to the incorrect assertion and potential misunderstanding of when to return `True`. Specifically:

- The first assertion is a clear example where the program fails to return the correct value. The program would have returned `True`, but according to the problem description, it should return `False` since 'z' is not in the substring between the first and last character.

Thus, the function does not meet the criteria as specified by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
