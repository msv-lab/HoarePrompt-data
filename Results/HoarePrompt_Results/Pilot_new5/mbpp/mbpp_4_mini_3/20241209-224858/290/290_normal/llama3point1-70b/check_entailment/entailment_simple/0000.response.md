Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to check if a string contains the letter 'z', except at the start and end of each word. 

Here's an explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Splitting the String:** The program begins by splitting the input string `s` into a list of words using `s.split()`. This correctly breaks the string into individual words for evaluation.

2. **Iterating Through Words:** The program then iterates through each word in the list of words.

3. **Length Check:** It checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 (`len(word) > 1`). This check ensures that there is potential for 'z' to exist in the inner portion of the word (i.e., between the first and the last character).

4. **Checking for 'z':** The condition `'z' in word[1:-1]` checks for the presence of the letter 'z' in the substring that excludes the first and last characters of the word. This directly addresses the requirement of the problem description to ignore 'z' at the start and end of words.

5. **Return Value:** If the condition is met (i.e., 'z' is found in the middle of a word), the function returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all the words, it returns `False`.

The logic covers all potential cases, ensuring that:
- If 'z' is at the start or end of a word, it does not affect the outcome.
- Words of length 1 are inherently ignored since they cannot contain 'z' in the specified manner.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and accurately checks for the presence of 'z' in the specified conditions, making it correct.
