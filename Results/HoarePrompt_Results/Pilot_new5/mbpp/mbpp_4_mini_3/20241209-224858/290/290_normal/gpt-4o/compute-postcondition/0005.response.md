Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. It returns True if at least one 'z' is found within that substring; otherwise, it returns False. If the string has a length of 2 or less, the substring is empty, and the function will return False since there cannot be any 'z' in an empty substring. **
