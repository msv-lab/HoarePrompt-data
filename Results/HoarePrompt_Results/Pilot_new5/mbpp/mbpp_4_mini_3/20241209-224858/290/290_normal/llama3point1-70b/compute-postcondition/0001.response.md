According to the code, for the loop to execute, the list `words` must contain at least one word. Since `s` is a string with a length of at least 1, it can be assumed that `words` is derived from `s` (for example, by splitting `s` into words). Therefore, as long as `s` is not empty, `words` should have at least one element.

At the start of the loop, `word` will be the first element in `words`. So we need to ensure that `words` has at least one word and `word` is set to the first word in the list.

State: **`s` is a string with a length of at least 1, `words` is a list of words derived from `s` that must have at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the list**
