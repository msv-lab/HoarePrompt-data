The `words` variable is assigned the value of the string `s` split into a list of words. The `split()` method divides the string at whitespace and returns a list of words. Since `s` has a length of at least 1, `words` will contain at least one element, which is the first word of `s`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the updated `words` variable based on the content of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string with a length of at least 1; `words` is a list of words derived from `s`.**
