Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description carefully.

**Problem Description:** Write a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False
```

**Output Hints:** The function accepts a string `s` with a length of at least 1 and returns True if any word in `s` (after being split into words) has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in its substring, excluding the first and last characters. If no such word exists, it returns False. The function does not check for special cases like strings without spaces or single-character words explicitly, but it inherently handles them by its logic.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code splits the input string `s` into words.
2. For each word, it checks if the length is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the substring that excludes the first and last characters.
3. If such a word is found, it returns `True`. If no such words are found after checking all words, it returns `False`.

### Edge Cases:
- Single-character words: For example, input like `"a"` should return `False` since there are no characters other than 'a'.
- Words with only one character: For example, input like `"z"` should return `False` since 'z' is at the start and end.
- A string containing multiple words but none of them have 'z' (except at the start or end): For example, `"hello world"` should return `False`.

### Verifying Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function checks for words with a length greater than 1 and that it correctly returns `True` or `False` based on whether any such word contains 'z' in the specified positions. It also mentions handling special cases implicitly, which seems reasonable considering the checks in the code.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program matches the problem description accurately. It checks for 'z' only in the middle of words longer than 1 character and handles edge cases without explicit checks. The output hints are consistent with the functionality of the code.

Since I cannot find a potential case where the code fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the function is implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
