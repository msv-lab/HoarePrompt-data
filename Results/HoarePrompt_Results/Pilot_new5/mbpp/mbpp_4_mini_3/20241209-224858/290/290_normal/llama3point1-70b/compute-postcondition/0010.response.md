Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length of at least 1, `words` is a list of at least 3 words, and `word` is the third word in the list. If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' within its substring (excluding the first and last character), the program returns True. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
