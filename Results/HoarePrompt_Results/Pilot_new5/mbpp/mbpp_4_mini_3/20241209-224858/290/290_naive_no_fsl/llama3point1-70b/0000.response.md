Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it does not handle the case when a word contains 'z' at the start or end correctly. 

For example, consider the input string `"zebra is lazy"`. The word `"zebra"` has 'z' at the start, and the program would incorrectly return `False` as it checks only if 'z' is present in the substring `word[1:-1]`. However, the requirement states that it should check whether 'z' is present in the word except at the start and end, meaning that words with 'z' at the start should not be counted, and it should only check the inner characters.

Moreover, for the input `"a z b"`, the program would also return `False` when it should return `True` since 'z' appears at the start and end of the string, but not in the middle. The program is missing logic to return `True` only if there is at least one 'z' present in a word without it being at the first or last position. 

Thus, since there are cases where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is marked as **False**.
