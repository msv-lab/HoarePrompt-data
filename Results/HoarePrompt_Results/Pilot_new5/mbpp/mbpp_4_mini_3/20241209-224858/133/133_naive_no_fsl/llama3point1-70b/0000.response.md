To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the implementation in detail.

### Problem Description
The problem requires a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple at the same index.

### Provided Code
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis
1. **Tuple Handling**: The program uses `zip(tup1, tup2)` to pair the elements of the two tuples. This means it will only iterate as long as the shorter tuple, which is a common behavior in Python when using `zip()`.
2. **Subtraction**: The subtraction `a - b` is done for each corresponding element. This is valid as long as the elements are numerical (integers or floats).
3. **Return Type**: The function returns a tuple, which aligns with the requirement of returning the results in tuple format.

### Edge Cases
1. **Different Length Tuples**: If `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths, `zip()` will stop at the shortest tuple. For example:
   - `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))` will return `(-3, -3)` but will ignore the `3` from the first tuple. This behavior might not be what is expected if all indices are supposed to be processed.
   
2. **Non-Numeric Elements**: If the tuples contain non-numeric types, an error will occur. For instance:
   - `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 'a', 6))` will raise a `TypeError` due to attempting to subtract an integer from a string.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis and the potential issues identified:

- The function does not handle tuples of different lengths correctly.
- The function does not handle non-numeric types, which leads to runtime errors.

Thus, the provided function does not adhere to the full specifications of the problem description for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**  
The function fails with tuples of different lengths and non-numeric elements, which are valid cases based on the problem description.
