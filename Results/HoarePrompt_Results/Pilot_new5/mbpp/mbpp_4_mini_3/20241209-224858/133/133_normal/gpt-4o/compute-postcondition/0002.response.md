Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length containing numerical values. It returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` when trying to zip them together. **
