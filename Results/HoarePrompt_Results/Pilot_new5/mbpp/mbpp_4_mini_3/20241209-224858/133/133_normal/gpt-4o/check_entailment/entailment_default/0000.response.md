The provided program attempts to subtract elements of one tuple from another tuple with the same index. The function `func_1` uses `zip` to pair elements from two tuples and then performs the subtraction inside a tuple comprehension. 

Initially, the code seems to follow the problem description as it correctly handles the subtraction of corresponding elements from the two tuples. However, an important edge case to consider is when the tuples are of different lengths.

The output hints indicate that if the tuples are of different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` when trying to zip them together. This condition is not explicitly handled in the function code. If the function encounters tuples of different lengths, it will indeed raise an error, but this behavior does not meet the problem description's requirement of simply performing the subtraction.

The output hints align with the function's behavior regarding error handling for unequal tuple lengths, confirming that the function does not accommodate the full potential cases as specified by the problem description.

Therefore, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically for tuples of different lengths), the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to provide a clear handling mechanism for tuples of differing lengths, which is a critical aspect of the problem description.
