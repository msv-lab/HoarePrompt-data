Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes in two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`). The program uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously, allowing it to access corresponding elements by their indices.

For each pair of elements (one from `tup1` and the other from `tup2`), the program computes the difference (`a - b`), where `a` is an element from `tup1` and `b` is the corresponding element from `tup2`. This is done for all elements of the tuples. The resulting differences are collected into a new tuple using `tuple(...)`, which is then returned.

The algorithm adheres to the requirement that the elements are subtracted index-wise, and since it explicitly checks that both tuples are of equal length (as stated in the precondition), it ensures that it will not encounter any out-of-bounds errors.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
