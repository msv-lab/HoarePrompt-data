Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the program:

1. It converts the input number to a string to easily access each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the number (i.e., the number of digits).
3. It initializes a variable `sum` to accumulate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. It iterates over each digit, converting it back to an integer, raising it to the power of `num_len`, and adding it to `sum`.
5. Finally, it checks if this calculated sum is equal to the original number and returns a boolean result.

The algorithm works correctly for all potential cases including:
- Single-digit numbers (0 through 9) which are Armstrong numbers.
- Multi-digit Armstrong numbers like 153 (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153).
- Non-Armstrong numbers like 10 or 100 which do not satisfy the conditions.

I could not identify any edge cases or examples where the program fails to determine if a number is an Armstrong number. Thus, based on the analysis, the program accurately follows the problem description for all numeric inputs.
