Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to check whether a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Hereâ€™s how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` receives a non-negative integer `num`, aligning with the specification which implies the function should work with such inputs.

2. **String Conversion**: The program converts the number to a string (`num_str = str(num)`) to easily iterate through each digit.

3. **Length Calculation**: It calculates the number of digits (`num_len = len(num_str)`), which is necessary for calculating the powers of the digits.

4. **Sum Calculation**: The program initializes `sum` to zero and iterates through each digit. For each digit, it converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and adds it to `sum`. This process is correct for calculating the Armstrong condition.

5. **Final Comparison**: Finally, it compares `sum` to `num` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that `num` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program works correctly for all non-negative integers, including cases like `0`, `1`, `153`, and `9474`, which are all Armstrong numbers, as well as cases like `2`, `10`, and `100`, which are not. 

Thus, the program satisfies the requirement stated in the problem description, and therefore, the correctness is affirmed.
