`armstrong_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of each digit in `num_str`, raised to the power of `num_len`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, we can conclude that `armstrong_sum` will be a non-negative integer that is the sum of the digits of `n` raised to the power of `num_len`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`; `armstrong_sum` is equal to the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
