The expression `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` modifies the variable `sum` by adding the result of `int(digit) ** num_len` to it. The new value of `sum` will be the previous value of `sum` plus `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`. 

Given that `num` is a non-negative integer (>= 0) and `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`, we know `digit` is the next character in `num_str`, thus it represents a single digit and can be converted to an integer. The `num_len` is at least 1, meaning the exponent will also be at least 1.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `sum` after the operation, while maintaining the original conditions for the other variables that were not affected.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (>= 0), `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num` with at least 1 character remaining, `num_len` is at least 1, `digit` is the next character in `num_str`, `sum` is updated to `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`**
