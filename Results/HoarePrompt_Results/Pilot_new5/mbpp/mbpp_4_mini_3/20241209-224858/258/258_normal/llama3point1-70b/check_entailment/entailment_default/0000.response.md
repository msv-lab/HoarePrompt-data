To evaluate the correctness of the provided function based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the function step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```
1. The variable `num` is converted to a string to iterate over each digit.
2. The length of the string (and thus the number of digits) is stored in `num_len`.
3. A sum is initialized to zero, and for each digit in the string representation, it is raised to the power of `num_len`, then added to `sum`.
4. Finally, the function checks if `sum` is equal to `num`.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- The function should correctly handle single-digit numbers (0 through 9), as these are Armstrong numbers.
- It should also handle 0 correctly, which is an Armstrong number since 0^1 = 0.
- The function does not handle negative numbers, but since the problem description specifies checking for a non-negative integer, there's no issue here.

### Output Hints:
The output hints indicate that the function accepts a non-negative integer and checks if it is an Armstrong number, correctly calculating the sum of its digits raised to the appropriate power and returning True or False based on the comparison.

### Conclusion:
The function accurately checks for Armstrong numbers as per the given problem description. It handles the relevant edge cases, including single-digit numbers and zero.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function meets the requirements of the problem description, as it computes the necessary sum and checks it against the original number for all valid (non-negative) inputs.
