According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_str`. For the loop to execute, `num_str` must be a non-empty string, which implies that `num` must be a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0. The `sum` variable starts at 0, which is not relevant for the loop's execution, but the `digit` variable will take on the value of each character in `num_str` during the iterations.

To ensure that the loop executes, `num` must be a non-negative integer that is at least 0 (which ensures `num_str` is non-empty) and `num_str` must contain at least one character (i.e., `num` must be greater than or equal to 0). Therefore, `num_len` must also be at least 1, as it is the length of `num_str`.

Finally, the loop starts with `digit` taking the value of the first character in `num_str`.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (>= 0), `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`, `num_len` must be at least 1, `digit` is the first character of `num_str`**
