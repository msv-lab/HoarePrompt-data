The variable `num_len` is assigned the value of the length of the string `num_str`, which is the string representation of the non-negative integer `n`. Therefore, `num_len` will be equal to the number of digits in `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.**
