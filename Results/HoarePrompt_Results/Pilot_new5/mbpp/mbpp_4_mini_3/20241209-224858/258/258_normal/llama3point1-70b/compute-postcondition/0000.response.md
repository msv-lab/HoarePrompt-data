The variable `num_str` is assigned the value of the string representation of `num`. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` will be a string that represents this non-negative integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.**
