To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the implementation closely.

### Problem description:
The task is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

### Program:
```python
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1(n)` converts the number `n` into a string to easily iterate over its digits.
2. It calculates the number of digits in `n` using `len(num_str)`.
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Finally, it checks if this calculated sum equals the original number `n`.

### Edge Cases:
- We need to consider some edge cases:
  - **Single-digit numbers**: All single-digit numbers (0-9) are Armstrong numbers because a number with one digit raised to the power of one is itself. For example, `0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `9` should return `True`.
  - **Negative numbers**: The function does not handle negative inputs, and negative numbers cannot be Armstrong numbers. For example, `-153` should return `False`.
  - **Zero**: `0` should also return `True` because `0^1 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle certain cases such as:
- It does not return the correct result for single-digit numbers.
- It does not handle negative numbers.
- There is no check for the special case of zero.

Thus, there are inputs for which the program would not function as intended according to the problem description, making it incorrect overall.

Correctness: **False**.
