Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number first and the first number second, as specified in the problem description. The assertions provided also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which matches the expected output.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which matches the expected output.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, which matches the expected output.

Since the function handles all tested cases correctly and there are no edge cases that are not accounted for in the problem description, I conclude that the program meets all requirements.
