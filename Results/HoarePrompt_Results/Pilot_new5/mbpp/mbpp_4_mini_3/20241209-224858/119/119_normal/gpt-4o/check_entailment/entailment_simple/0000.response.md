Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem requires taking two numbers and returning a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. 

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are meant to be the two numbers.
2. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple in the format `(b, a)`. This means it returns the second number (b) first, followed by the first number (a), exactly as required by the problem description.
3. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program (e.g., `assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`) confirm that the function correctly returns the expected output for various inputs.

Since all cases and the general functionality align perfectly with the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.
