The given program takes two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. 

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)
```
This implementation does exactly what the problem description specifies. It accepts two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns them in the order `(b, a)`.

Now, let's analyze if there are any edge cases that the code might not handle. The problem description does not specify any constraints on the types or values of inputs, but typically we would expect numbers (integers or floats). The function should handle:
1. Positive numbers
2. Negative numbers
3. Zero
4. Floating-point numbers
5. Any numeric types that can be passed as parameters

Since there are no stated types or constraints in the problem description, it's reasonable to assume that the function should work correctly for any numerical input, as they can be unpacked into a tuple without any specific conditions.

Now, the output hints confirm that the function correctly accepts two parameters `a` and `b` and returns a tuple containing `b` and `a` in reversed order. The output hints also state that there are no edge cases or additional functionality needed beyond this reversal.

Given that the code correctly implements the desired functionality as described in the problem description and the output hints align with the code, I do not see any potential cases where it would fail to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
