The provided program `func_1` is designed to take an array and an element, returning a tuple that indicates whether the element is present in the array and, if so, its index. Let's analyze the code against the problem description and the output hints.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element.
2. It checks if the `value` equals the `element`. If they match, it returns `(True, index)`.
3. If no matches are found after iterating through the entire array, it returns `(False, -1)`.
4. The function also naturally handles the case where the input array is empty, returning `(False, -1)` since the loop won't run.

### Edge Cases:
1. If the input array is empty, the function correctly returns `(False, -1)`.
2. If the `element` to be searched is not in the array, it also correctly returns `(False, -1)`.
3. The function assumes that the `element` is comparable to the elements in the array, which is not explicitly handled in the code. If an incorrect type is passed (e.g., comparing a string to integers), it might raise a `TypeError`. However, the problem description does not indicate that it should handle incorrect types, so this is not necessarily an issue according to the problem description.
4. The function only returns the index of the **first occurrence** of the `element`, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that:
- The function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence if found.
- It returns `False` and `-1` if not found (including when the array is empty).
- It does not raise exceptions for incorrect input types, which aligns with the functionâ€™s behavior.

### Validity of Output Hints:
- The hints accurately describe the behavior of the code. The hints do not indicate any contradictions or unexpected results. The handling of empty arrays and the return values seem to be aligned with the code's functionality.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. All potential cases, including empty arrays and cases where the element is not found, are handled correctly. Given that there are no edge cases that would lead to incorrect behavior based on the description and output hints, the program is deemed correct.

Correctness: **True**.
