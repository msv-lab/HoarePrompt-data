The program could raise a `ValueError` if the `element` is not found in the `array` when trying to get its index using `array.index(element)`. If the `element` is found, the function returns `True` along with the index of the `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is not found, the `ValueError` is caught, and the function returns `False` with an index of `-1`, indicating the absence of the `element`.

Therefore, the output state is: `array` is a list of elements, and `element` can be of any type that is comparable to the elements in the `array`. If the `element` is present in the `array`, the function returns `True` and the index of `element`; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`.
