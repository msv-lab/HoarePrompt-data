The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `element`. The parameter `array` is a list of elements, and `element` can be of any type that is comparable to the elements in the `array`. If `element` is present in the `array`, the function returns `True` along with its index in the list; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of elements and an element, returning information on whether the element is present in the list and its corresponding index, or indicating its absence. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of elements, and a parameter `element`, which can be of any comparable type. It returns `True` and the index of `element` if `element` is present in `array`; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`.**
