Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes in two parameters: `array`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which can be of any type that is comparable to the elements in the `array`. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Checking for Element Presence**: The function uses the `index()` method of the list, which returns the index of the first occurrence of `element` if it exists in `array`. If `element` is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index, meeting the requirement of indicating presence and returning the index.

3. **Handling Absence of Element**: The function is wrapped in a try-except block, which efficiently handles the case where `element` is not found in `array`. When a `ValueError` is raised (indicating `element` is not in `array`), the function correctly returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`, fulfilling the requirement of indicating absence and returning `-1`.

4. **Return Values**: The function's return values are structured as a tuple, which directly corresponds to the output specified in the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to satisfy the problem description for all possible cases, thus it is correct.
