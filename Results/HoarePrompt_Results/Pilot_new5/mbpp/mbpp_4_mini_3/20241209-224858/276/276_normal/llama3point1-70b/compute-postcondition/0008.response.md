The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It also accepts a parameter `size`, which is a positive integer that is equal to the lengths of both `list1` and `list2`. The function returns the median of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements of the merged list; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the merged list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `size`, returning the median of the combined sorted lists based on the value of `size.**
