Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are two lists of integers that are sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the lengths of both lists, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the `median` is equal to `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`. Otherwise, the `median` is the element at index `size - 1` of `merged_list`.***
