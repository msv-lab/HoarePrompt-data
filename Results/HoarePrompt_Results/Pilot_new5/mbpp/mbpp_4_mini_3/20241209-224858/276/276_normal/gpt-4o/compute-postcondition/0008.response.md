The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists of integers, and a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the size of the lists. The function merges both lists, sorts the merged list, and then computes the median of this merged list based on whether its length is even or odd. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of integers and their size, and return the median of the sorted merged list of these integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers, list1 and list2, both of the same size n, and returns the median of the sorted merged list containing all integers from list1 and list2.**
