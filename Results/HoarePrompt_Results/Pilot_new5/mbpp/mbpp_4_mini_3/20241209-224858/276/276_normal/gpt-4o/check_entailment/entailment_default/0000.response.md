The given problem description is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The provided program attempts to achieve this by merging the two lists, sorting them, and then calculating the median based on the length of the merged list.

Initially, the program seems to follow the problem description correctly for the cases where both input lists are of the same positive length as indicated. It merges the two lists, sorts them, and calculates the median based on whether the merged list has an even or odd length. The assertions provided also reflect that the program handles cases with even and odd total lengths correctly, returning the expected median values.

However, we need to examine potential edge cases where the program might not function as intended. Specifically, the problem description does not stipulate that the input lists are guaranteed to be non-empty or of the same size. Thus, if either of the lists were empty (or of different sizes), the program would encounter issues. For example, calling `func_1([], [1], 1)` would lead to an unexpected behavior, potentially throwing an error or returning an incorrect value since the function does not handle empty lists or lists of varying sizes.

Now, referring to the output hints, they clarify that the function assumes both input lists are of the same positive length but does not handle cases where the lists might be empty or of different sizes. This further confirms the potential edge cases I identified.

Therefore, since the program does not handle cases where the input lists might be empty or of different sizes, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
