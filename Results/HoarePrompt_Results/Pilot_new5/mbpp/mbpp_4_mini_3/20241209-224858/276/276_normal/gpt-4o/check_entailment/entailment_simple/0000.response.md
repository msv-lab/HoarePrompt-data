Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The issue lies in how the function merges the two lists and calculates the median. 

In the problem description, it specifies finding the median of two sorted lists. However, the function `func_1` first concatenates the two lists, sorts the combined list, and then calculates the median from the sorted merged list. While this works for finding the median of a merged list, it does not take advantage of the fact that both input lists are already sorted. The correct approach would involve using a more efficient algorithm, such as a binary search, to find the median without fully merging and sorting the arrays.

Moreover, if the lists are very large, the current implementation could lead to inefficiency and high memory usage due to the complete sorting of all elements, which is not necessary when both lists are already sorted.

In summary, while the program may return the correct median for the given test cases, it does not adhere to the requirements of efficiently finding the median of two sorted lists, leading to the conclusion that it does not meet the problem description correctly.
