#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, both of the same size n, and n is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of size `n`; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all integers from `list1` and `list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, then `median` is equal to (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2. Otherwise, if the length of `merged_list` is odd, then `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted merged list containing all integers from `list1` and `list2`, calculated based on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of the same size `n`. It merges and sorts these lists, then calculates and returns the median of the sorted merged list. The function correctly handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list. However, it assumes that both input lists are of the same positive length, but does not handle cases where the lists might be empty or of different sizes, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
