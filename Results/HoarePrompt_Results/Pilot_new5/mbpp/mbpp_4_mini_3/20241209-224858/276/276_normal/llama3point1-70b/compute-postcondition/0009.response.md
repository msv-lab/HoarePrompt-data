Functionality: ** The function accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with a positive integer `size` that represents the lengths of both lists. It merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and returns the median. If `size` is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element. However, it assumes `size` is equal to the length of the original lists and does not handle cases where the lists might be empty or `size` does not match the actual lengths of the lists, which could lead to index errors.**
