Upon examining the problem description, the function is intended to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The provided program merges the two lists, sorts them, and then computes the median based on whether the size is even or odd.

However, the function does not handle several important edge cases:

1. **Empty Lists**: If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, this would lead to an incorrect computation or an index error because `size` should not be assumed to be valid if the lists are empty.

2. **Size Mismatch**: The function assumes that the `size` parameter accurately represents the lengths of both lists. If `size` does not match the actual lengths of the lists, it can lead to index errors when accessing elements in `merged_list`.

3. **Incorrect Median Calculation for Even Sizes**: The calculation for the median when the size is even is incorrect. The middle index should be calculated as `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2` rather than `size - 1` and `size`.

Now, looking at the output hints: they mention that the function does not handle cases where the lists might be empty or where the `size` does not match the actual lengths of the lists, leading to potential index errors. This aligns with the concerns raised above.

Given this analysis, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to the unhandled edge cases mentioned.

Correctness: **False**.
