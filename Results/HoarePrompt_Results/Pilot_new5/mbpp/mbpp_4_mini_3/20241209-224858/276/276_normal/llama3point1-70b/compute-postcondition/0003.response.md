The variable `median` is assigned the value calculated as the average of two elements from `merged_list`. Given that `size` is even and `middle_index` is `size - 1`, the elements being accessed are `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`. Therefore, `median` becomes the average of the two middle values in the sorted list.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the output state reflects that `median` is a computed value based on the current state of `merged_list` and is defined as:

`median = (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two lists of integers that are sorted in non-decreasing order; `size` is a positive integer such that `size > 0` and it is equal to the lengths of both `list1` and `list2`; `middle_index` is `size - 1`; `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`; `median` is equal to `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`.**
