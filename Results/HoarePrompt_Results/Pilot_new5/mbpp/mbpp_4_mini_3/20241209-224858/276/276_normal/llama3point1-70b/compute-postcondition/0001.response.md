The variable `middle_index` is assigned the value `size - 1`. Since `size` is a positive integer and is equal to the lengths of both `list1` and `list2`, the value of `middle_index` will be the last index of the lists, which is `size - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two lists of integers that are sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer such that size > 0 and size is equal to the lengths of both `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`.**
