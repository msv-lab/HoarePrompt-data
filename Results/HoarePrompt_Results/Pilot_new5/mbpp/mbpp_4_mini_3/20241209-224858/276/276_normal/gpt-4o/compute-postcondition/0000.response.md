The variable `merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. Since both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers and have the same size `n`, the output will be a single sorted list that contains all the integers from both lists. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of size `n`, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all integers from `list1` and `list2`.**
