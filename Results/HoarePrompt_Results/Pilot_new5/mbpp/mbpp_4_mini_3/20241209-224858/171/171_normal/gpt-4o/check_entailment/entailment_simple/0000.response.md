Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It checks whether the parity of the number is odd by evaluating the expression `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., when the result of the modulo operation is 1) and `False` if `n` is even (i.e., when the result of the modulo operation is 0).
3. The provided assertions test the function with various integers:
   - `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct since 12 is even.
   - `func_1(7)` returns `True`, which is correct since 7 is odd.
   - `func_1(10)` returns `False`, which is correct since 10 is even.

Since the function behaves correctly for all tested cases and accurately determines whether the parity of the integer is odd, it fulfills the requirements set forth in the problem description. Thus, the correctness of the program is validated.
