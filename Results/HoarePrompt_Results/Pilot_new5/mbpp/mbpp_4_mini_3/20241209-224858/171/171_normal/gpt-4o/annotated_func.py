#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer and False if n is an even integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. There are no explicit checks for non-integer types, so passing a non-integer could lead to unexpected behavior or an error. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not an integer, such as float or string inputs.
