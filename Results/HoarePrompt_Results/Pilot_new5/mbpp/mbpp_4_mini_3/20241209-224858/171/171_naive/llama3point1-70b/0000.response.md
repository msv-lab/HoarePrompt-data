Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. It uses the modulus operator `%` to check if the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 is not equal to zero (`n % 2 != 0`). If the result is `True`, then `n` is odd; if `False`, then `n` is even. 

This logic holds true for all integer inputs:

- For even numbers (e.g., 0, 2, 4, -2, -4), the function will return `False`.
- For odd numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 5, -1, -3), the function will return `True`.

The function handles all integers, including negative numbers and zero, correctly identifying the parity as defined in the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is accurate and meets the requirements specified.
