Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` which takes three lists of integers as input. The function concatenates these three lists using the `+` operator, which effectively combines all the elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into a single list. 

After combining the lists, the program uses the `sorted()` function to sort the resulting list in ascending order. This ensures that the final output meets the requirement of producing a single sorted list containing all the integers from the three input lists.

The approach is valid and will always yield a correctly sorted list irrespective of the initial order of the elements in the input lists. Thus, the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.
