The function accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers. It combines these lists and returns a sorted list containing all integers from the combined lists. The function does not handle cases where any of the lists are not provided or if they are empty, as it will still return an empty sorted list if all inputs are empty.
