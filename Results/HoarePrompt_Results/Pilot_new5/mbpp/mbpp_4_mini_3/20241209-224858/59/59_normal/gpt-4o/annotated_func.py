#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #The program returns the sorted version of the combined list containing all integers from list1, list2, and list3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers. It combines these lists and returns a sorted list containing all integers from the combined lists. The function does not handle cases where any of the lists are not provided or if they are empty, as it will still return an empty sorted list if all inputs are empty.
