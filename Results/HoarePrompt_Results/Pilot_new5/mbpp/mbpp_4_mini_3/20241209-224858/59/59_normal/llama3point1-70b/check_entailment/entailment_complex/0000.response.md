Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which states that the function must merge three lists into a single sorted list. Let's break down why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, all of which are specified to be lists of integers. This aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem.

2. **Merging the Lists**: The program combines the three lists using the `+` operator: `list1 + list2 + list3`. This effectively merges the contents of all three lists into one single list.

3. **Sorting the Result**: The merged list is then passed to the `sorted()` function. This function returns a new list containing all the integers sorted in ascending order, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns this sorted list, which is a combination of the integers from the three input lists.

The implementation fulfills all aspects of the problem description consistently, regardless of the specific integer values or the sizes of the input lists. Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.
