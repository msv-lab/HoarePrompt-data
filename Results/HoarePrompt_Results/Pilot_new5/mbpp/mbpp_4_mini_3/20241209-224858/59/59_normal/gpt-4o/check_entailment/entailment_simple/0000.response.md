Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to merge three lists into a single sorted list. 

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Combining Lists**: The function `func_1` takes three lists as inputs (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) and combines them into a single list using the expression `combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3`. This correctly merges the three lists.

2. **Sorting the Combined List**: After combining the lists, the function sorts the merged list using the built-in `sorted()` function, which returns a new list containing all items from the `combined_list` sorted in ascending order.

3. **Returning the Result**: The function then returns the sorted list, fulfilling the requirement to provide a single sorted list as output.

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases that confirm the function produces the expected sorted list for different combinations of input lists. Since all assertions evaluate to `True`, it demonstrates that the function handles various scenarios correctly.

Overall, the logic employed in the function aligns perfectly with the problem description, ensuring that it will consistently meet the requirements regardless of the specific integer values and distributions present in the input lists.
