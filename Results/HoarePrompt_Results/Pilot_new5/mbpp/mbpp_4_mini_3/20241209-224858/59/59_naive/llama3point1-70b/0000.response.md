Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The use of the `sorted()` function ensures that the combined list is properly sorted irrespective of the individual order of elements in the input lists. This approach handles edge cases such as empty lists and varying lengths of lists effectively. For example:

- If all input lists are empty, the output will also be an empty list, which is correct.
- If one list is empty and the others contain elements, the output will be a sorted combination of the non-empty lists.
- If all three lists contain elements, the output will be a single sorted list that includes all elements from the three input lists, correctly reflecting their combined order.

Therefore, the function meets the problem description's requirements for all potential cases.
