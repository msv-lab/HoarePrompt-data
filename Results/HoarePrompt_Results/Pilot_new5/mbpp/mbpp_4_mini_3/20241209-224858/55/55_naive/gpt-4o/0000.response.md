Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the input snake case string begins with an underscore or contains multiple consecutive underscores. For example, if we pass the string `'_python_program'`, the expected output should be `'PythonProgram'`, but the current implementation will yield `'PythonProgram'`, which is correct. However, if we test it with `'python__program'`, which has consecutive underscores, the function will return `'PythonProgram'` instead of the expected `'PythonProgram'` (it incorrectly assumes that consecutive underscores denote separate words). 

Additionally, there is no handling for empty strings. If the input is an empty string `''`, the function will return `''`, which is not a valid camel case conversion.

Thus, since there are cases where the function does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is false.
