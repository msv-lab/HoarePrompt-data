The value of `words` is assigned the result of splitting `snake_case_str` by the underscore character. This operation transforms `snake_case_str`, which consists of lowercase letters and underscores, into a list of words. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string that consists of lowercase letters, underscores, and may contain multiple words separated by underscores; `words` is a list of words obtained from `snake_case_str` split by underscores.**
