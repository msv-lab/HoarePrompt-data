#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_str is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, where the underscores separate the words.
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of the capitalized words obtained by splitting 'snake_str' at each underscore.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `snake_str` consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, splits it into components using underscores, capitalizes each component, and returns a single string that is the concatenation of these capitalized words. Note that the function does not handle any additional edge cases, such as leading or trailing underscores, multiple consecutive underscores, or an empty input string, which may lead to unexpected results like returning an empty string or incorrect capitalization.
