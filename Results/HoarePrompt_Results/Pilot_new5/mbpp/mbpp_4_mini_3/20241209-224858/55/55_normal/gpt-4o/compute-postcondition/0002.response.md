The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `snake_str`. `snake_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, where the underscores separate the words. After executing the function body, it processes `snake_str` by splitting it at each underscore and capitalizing each resulting word, returning the concatenation of these capitalized words as a single string. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `snake_str` and return a string that is the concatenation of the capitalized words obtained from `snake_str` by splitting at underscores. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter snake_str and returns a string that is the concatenation of the capitalized words obtained by splitting `snake_str` at each underscore.**
