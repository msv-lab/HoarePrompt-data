`components` is assigned the value of `snake_str.split('_')`, which splits the string `snake_str` into a list of components based on the underscore `_` delimiter. The previous value of `snake_str` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `components` as a list of substrings obtained from the split operation.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, where the underscores separate the words; `components` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `snake_str` at each underscore.**
