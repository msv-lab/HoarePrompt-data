Initially, let's analyze the provided code and the problem description.

### Problem description:
The task is to convert a snake case string (with lowercase letters and underscores) into a camel case string. This means that:
- The string is split by underscores.
- Each word's first letter is capitalized.
- The capitalized words are joined together without any underscores.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Splitting the String:** The code uses `.split('_')` to divide the input string into words based on underscores, which is correct for the snake case format.
2. **Capitalizing Words:** It uses a generator expression to capitalize the first letter of each word with `word.capitalize()`, which is appropriate.
3. **Joining Words:** The capitalized words are combined without any spaces or underscores using `''.join()`, which is also correct.
4. **Return Value:** The function returns the created camel case string.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty String:** The function should return an empty string when `snake_case_str` is empty. The code handles this correctly, as `split('_')` on an empty string produces a list with one element: an empty string, which results in returning an empty camel case string.
2. **Single Word:** For example, the input `'word'` should return `'Word'`, which the code handles correctly.
3. **Multiple Words:** The input `'this_is_a_test'` should correctly return `'ThisIsATest'`. The code handles this case correctly as well.
4. **Leading or Trailing Underscores:** The input `'_leading'` should return `'Leading'`, and the input `'trailing_'` should return `'Trailing'`. The code manages leading and trailing underscores correctly by including them in the split.
5. **Consecutive Underscores:** The input `'this__is__a__test'` should return `'ThisIsATest'`, but the current implementation will treat consecutive underscores as separate empty strings, resulting in a camel case string that can potentially have unexpected leading capitals.

### Output Hints:
The hints provided state that the function should handle an empty string and gives a clear overview of its operation. These hints align with the expected functionality of the code.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case of consecutive underscores correctly. For example, the input `'this__is__a__test'` would yield `'ThisIsATest'`, but the expected behavior should ignore the empty strings resulting from consecutive underscores. Therefore, the code does not correctly conform to the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
