Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for converting a snake_case string to camelCase. While the function `func_1` capitalizes each component of the split string and concatenates them, it does not ensure that the initial character of the output string is lowercase, which is characteristic of camelCase notation.

For example, given the input `snake_str = 'python_program'`, the expected output in camelCase should be `'pythonProgram'`, but the function produces `'PythonProgram'`. This inconsistency is a violation of the camelCase format as specified in the problem description.

Thus, the program fails to correctly implement the conversion from snake_case to camelCase for every case.
