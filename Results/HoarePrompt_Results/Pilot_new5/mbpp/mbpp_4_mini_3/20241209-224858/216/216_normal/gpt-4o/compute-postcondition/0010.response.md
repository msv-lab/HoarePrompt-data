Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`, and `len(lst_sorted)` is greater than or equal to 2. If the difference between the elements at indices 1 and 2 in `lst_sorted` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything.***
