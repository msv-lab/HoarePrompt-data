To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze both the program and the problem description thoroughly.

### Problem Description
The task is to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. The expected output is:
- Return `True` if all numbers in the list are consecutive.
- Return `False` if the list is empty or if any adjacent elements in the sorted list do not differ by exactly 1.

### Program Analysis
The function `func_1` is structured as follows:
1. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is.
2. It then sorts the list of numbers.
3. It checks for every adjacent pair in the sorted list to see if they differ by exactly 1. If any pair does not, it returns `False`.
4. If all pairs are consecutive, it returns `True`.

### Output Hints
The output hints confirm that the function:
- Returns `False` for an empty list.
- Returns `False` if any adjacent elements in the sorted list do not differ by exactly 1.
- Returns `True` if all elements differ by exactly 1.

### Edge Case Consideration
While the program seems to correctly handle the cases described, we need to consider an edge case:
- The program does not consider duplicate numbers. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, sorting this would yield `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, and while the adjacent pairs (1, 2) and (2, 3) differ by 1, the presence of the duplicate '2' means that the numbers are not consecutive in the sense required by the problem description. Thus, the program would incorrectly return `True`.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the functionality as described in the problem statement because it fails to account for duplicates, which would invalidate the condition of having only consecutive integers.

Correctness: **False**. 
The function fails for cases like `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, where it should return `False` but would incorrectly return `True`.
