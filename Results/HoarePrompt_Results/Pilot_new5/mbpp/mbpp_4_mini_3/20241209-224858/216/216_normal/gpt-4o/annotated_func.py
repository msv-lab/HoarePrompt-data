#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False because the list 'lst' is currently empty.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`, `len(lst_sorted)` is greater than or equal to 1, and all elements in `lst_sorted` differ by exactly 1.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list `lst_sorted` has all elements differing by exactly 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns False if the list is empty or if any adjacent elements in the sorted list do not differ by exactly 1. If all elements in the sorted list differ by exactly 1, it returns True.
