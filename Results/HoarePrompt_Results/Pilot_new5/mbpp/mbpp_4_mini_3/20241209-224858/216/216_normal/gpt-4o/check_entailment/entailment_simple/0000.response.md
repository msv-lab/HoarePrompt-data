Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(lst)` is intended to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. 

2. **Handling Empty Lists**: The function first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` in that case, which is appropriate because an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

3. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list using `sorted(lst)`. This is essential for checking consecutive numbers, as it arranges the integers in increasing order.

4. **Checking Consecutiveness**: The for loop iterates through the sorted list and checks if each pair of adjacent elements differs by exactly 1. If any pair does not meet this criterion, it returns `False`, indicating that the list does not contain consecutive numbers.

5. **Return Value**: If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive pairs, the function returns `True`, confirming that the list does indeed contain consecutive numbers.

6. **Comprehensive Testing**: The assertions provided check various scenarios:
   - A list of consecutive numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` correctly returns `True`.
   - A list with gaps `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` correctly returns `False`.
   - A list with repeated values `[1, 2, 1]` also correctly returns `False`.

Since the function adheres to the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases as illustrated by the assertions, it is deemed to be correct.
