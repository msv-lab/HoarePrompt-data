According to the code, the loop will execute based on the length of `lst_sorted`. Since `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` will also be a non-empty list. For the loop to execute, `len(lst_sorted) - 1` must be at least 0, which means `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 1. Therefore, `lst_sorted` must have at least 1 element.

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be equal to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`, which means at the start of the loop, `i` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`, `i` is 0, `len(lst_sorted) must be greater than or equal to 1`**
