To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description: "Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not."

The program is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The function first checks if the input list `lst` is empty. If it is, it returns `False`. This is a reasonable check since an empty list does not contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting**: The function sorts the list. This is necessary because consecutive numbers need to be in order to be detected.

3. **Checking for Consecutiveness**: The function iterates through the sorted list and checks if each number is exactly 1 more than the previous number. If it finds any pair that does not satisfy this condition, it returns `False`.

4. **Returning True**: If all pairs satisfy the consecutiveness condition, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider various edge cases:
- **Empty List**: The function correctly returns `False`.
- **Single Element List**: For example, `func_1([3])` should return `True` since a single number can be considered as having no gaps.
- **Negative Numbers**: For example, `func_1([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1])` should return `False` because they are not consecutive in terms of integers.
- **Duplicates**: For example, `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3])` should return `False` because duplicates mean not all numbers are present consecutively.

### Testing with the additional cases:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True`: Correct.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False`: Correct.
- `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False`: Correct.
- `func_1([])`: returns `False`: Correct.
- `func_1([3])`: should return `True`: This is an edge case that is correct.
- `func_1([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1])`: should return `False`: Correct.
- `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3])`: should return `False`: Correct.

### Conclusion:
All potential cases that I thought of have been handled correctly by the function. The function correctly identifies whether the list contains consecutive numbers.

Correctness: **True**.
