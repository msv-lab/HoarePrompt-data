To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description, which specifies that the function should check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

The function `func_1(lst)` first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `False`, which seems reasonable since an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers. Next, it sorts the list and iterates through it, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent sorted numbers is exactly `1` to determine if they are consecutive.

Now, let's evaluate the provided test cases:
1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True` because the numbers are consecutive.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False` because the numbers `3`, `5` are not consecutive (`4` is missing).
3. `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False` because the list does not contain unique consecutive numbers.

Next, we need to consider edge cases and any potential issues in the function:

1. **Single Element List**: A list with a single element, e.g., `func_1([1])`, should return `True` since a single number can be considered trivially consecutive (it does not have any gaps).
2. **Duplicate Consecutive Numbers**: A case like `func_1([2, 2, 3, 4])` should return `False` because even though `2`, `3`, and `4` are consecutive, the presence of duplicate `2` means that the list does not contain unique consecutive numbers.
3. **Negative Numbers**: We should also consider a list of negative and positive numbers, e.g., `func_1([-2, -1, 0, 1])`, which should return `True` as `-2, -1, 0, 1` are consecutive when including zero.
4. **Non-Sequential Gaps**: A case like `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5])` should return `False` due to the missing `3`.

Based on the analysis above, we can find a case that the program does not handle correctly, such as `func_1([2, 2, 3, 4])`, which returns `False` instead of `True`.

Therefore, the program is not correctly implemented according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
