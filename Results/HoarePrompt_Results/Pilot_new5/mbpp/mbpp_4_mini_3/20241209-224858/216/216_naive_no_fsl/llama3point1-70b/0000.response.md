To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic against the problem description of checking whether the list contains consecutive numbers.

The program does the following:
1. It sorts the input list `lst`.
2. It checks two conditions:
   - Whether each element in the sorted list differs from the previous element by exactly 1 (indicating consecutive numbers).
   - Whether the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list (ensuring that there are no duplicates).

Let's assess potential edge cases:

1. **Example with duplicates**: 
   - Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3]`
   - Expected output: `False` (because 2 is duplicated).
   - The program will return `False` as expected.

2. **Example with gaps**: 
   - Input: `[1, 2, 4]`
   - Expected output: `False` (4 is not consecutive to 2).
   - The program will return `False` as expected.

3. **Example with a single element**: 
   - Input: `[5]`
   - Expected output: `True` (a single number can be considered as a consecutive series).
   - The program will return `True` as expected.

4. **Example with negative numbers**: 
   - Input: `[-1, 0, 1]`
   - Expected output: `True` (the numbers are consecutive).
   - The program will return `True` as expected.

5. **Example with an empty list**: 
   - Input: `[]`
   - Expected output: `True` (an empty list can be considered as having no non-consecutive numbers).
   - The program will return `True` as expected.

6. **Example with non-consecutive and duplicates**:
   - Input: `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]`
   - Expected output: `False` (5 is duplicated and it is not a complete set of consecutive numbers).
   - The program will return `False` as expected.

After evaluating the program against the test cases, we find that it correctly identifies whether a list contains consecutive numbers in all potential scenarios. 

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly handles cases of duplicates, gaps, single elements, negative numbers, and empty lists as specified in the problem description.
