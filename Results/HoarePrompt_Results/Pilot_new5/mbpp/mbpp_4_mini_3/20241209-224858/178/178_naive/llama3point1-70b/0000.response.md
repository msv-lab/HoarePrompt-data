Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly rounds each number in the input list `numbers` and computes the total sum of the rounded values. It then multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Rounding**: Each number in the list is rounded correctly using the built-in `round()` function.
2. **Summation**: The program sums up the rounded numbers using `sum()`.
3. **Multiplication by Length**: The total sum is multiplied by the length of the original list, which is accurately obtained using `len(numbers)`.

The code handles any list of numbers, including edge cases such as an empty list (though it returns 0, which is expected given the problem description). Therefore, there are no identified issues or missing logic in the implementation.
