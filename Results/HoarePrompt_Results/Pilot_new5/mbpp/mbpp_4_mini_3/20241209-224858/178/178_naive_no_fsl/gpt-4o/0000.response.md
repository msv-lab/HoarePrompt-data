To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the implementation against the problem description.

**Problem Description:**
The goal is to round every number in a provided list, then compute the total sum of the rounded numbers, and finally multiply this sum by the length of the list.

**Program Analysis:**
The function `func_1` is as follows:
1. It takes a list of numbers as input.
2. It rounds each number in the list using the `round()` function.
3. It computes the sum of the rounded numbers.
4. It multiplies this sum by the length of the original list.
5. It returns the final result.

**Given Assertions:**
- The assertion checks for three different lists of numbers and their expected results.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. An empty list: `func_1([])` should return `0` since the sum and length are both `0`.
2. A list with negative numbers only: `func_1([-1.5, -2.5])` should handle rounding correctly, leading to a sum of `-4` for a length of `2`, resulting in `-8`.
3. A list with only zeros: `func_1([0, 0, 0])` should return `0 * 3 = 0`.

Now, I want to check these edge cases against the program's logic:

1. **Empty List**:
   - `func_1([])` returns `0` (correct).
   
2. **Negative Numbers**:
   - `func_1([-1.5, -2.5])` rounds to `-2` and `-2`, giving a sum of `-4`, and multiplied by the length `2`: `-4 * 2 = -8` (correct).
   
3. **List of Zeros**:
   - `func_1([0, 0, 0])` sums up to `0`, with a length of `3`: `0 * 3 = 0` (correct).

Based on the analysis and the checks against the edge cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and handles various potential cases correctly.

**Correctness: True** 

The function correctly rounds each number, sums them, and multiplies the sum by the length of the list for all tested cases, including edge cases. Thus, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
