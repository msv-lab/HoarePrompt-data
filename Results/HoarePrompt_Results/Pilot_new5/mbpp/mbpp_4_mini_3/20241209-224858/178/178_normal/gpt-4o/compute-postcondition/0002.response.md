The variable `result` is assigned the value of `total_sum` multiplied by the length of the `numbers` list. The value of `total_sum` remains unchanged, and we derive `len(numbers)` from the current state of `numbers`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers, `total_sum` is the sum of the integers in `rounded_numbers`, and `result` is equal to `total_sum * len(numbers)`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers, `total_sum` is the sum of the integers in `rounded_numbers`, `result` is equal to `total_sum * len(numbers)`**.
