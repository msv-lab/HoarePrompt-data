The code `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)` calculates the sum of the elements in the list `rounded_numbers`. The variable `total_sum` will now hold the total of the rounded values in `rounded_numbers`. The initial state does not specify the values in `numbers` or `rounded_numbers`, so we cannot determine the exact numeric values of `total_sum` but we can say that it is the sum of the values in `rounded_numbers`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values (integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded values of each element in `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`.**
