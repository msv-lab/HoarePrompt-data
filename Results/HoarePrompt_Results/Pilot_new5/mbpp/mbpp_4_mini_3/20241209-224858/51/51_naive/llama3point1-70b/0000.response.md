Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires multiplying all the numbers in a list and then dividing by the length of the list. However, the program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. If `numbers` is an empty list, `len(numbers)` will be 0, resulting in a division by zero error when trying to perform `product / len(numbers)`. Thus, the program does not work correctly for an empty list input.
