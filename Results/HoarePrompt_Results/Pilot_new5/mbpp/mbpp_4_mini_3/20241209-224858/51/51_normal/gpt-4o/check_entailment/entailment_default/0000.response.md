The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide the product by the length of the list. Let's assess the program step by step according to the problem description and the output hints.

1. **Problem Description**: The function needs to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide the result by the length of the list.

2. **Analysis of the Code**: 
   - The code initializes a `product` variable to 1 and iterates through the `numbers` list, multiplying each number to `product`.
   - After calculating the product, it divides the product by the length of the list and returns the result.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If any number in the list is zero, the product will be zero. According to the problem description, this case would yield a result of `0 / len(numbers)`, which is valid but could be misleading in contexts where a non-zero product is expected.
   - All input cases given in the assertions seem to be non-zero, but the function does not account for lists containing zero, which could make the function misleading.

4. **Output Hints**: The output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the list may contain zero, which is a valid point. This implies that there is an edge case where the function could produce an unexpected result (the product being zero when one or more elements are zero).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, while the code seems to work for the provided examples, it does not handle the case where the input list contains zero. This is crucial since the problem description does not exclude zero from the input, meaning the function could mislead users when zero is present in the input list.

Therefore, since the function does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description for all potential cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
