The code updates the `product` variable by multiplying it with `num`. Initially, `product` is 1, and `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list, which we will denote as `num` (the specific value of `num` is not known, but it is the first element of `numbers`). 

Therefore, after the execution of the line `product *= num`, the new value of `product` will be `1 * num`, which simplifies to `num`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Hence the output state will reflect the updated value of `product` while still acknowledging the state of the other variables.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first number in the list**.
