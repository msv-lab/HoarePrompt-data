The function accepts a non-empty list of integers or floats and calculates the product of all elements in the list. It then returns the mean of these products by dividing the product by the length of the list. The function does not handle cases where the list may contain zero, which would make the product zero, potentially leading to a misleading result when the length of the list is considered.
