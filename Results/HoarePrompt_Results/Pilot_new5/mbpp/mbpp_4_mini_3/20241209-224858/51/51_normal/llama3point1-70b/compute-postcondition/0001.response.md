According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the beginning, `product` is set to 1, but this does not influence the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `numbers` must have at least 1 element, and `num` will be the first number in the list during the first iteration.

State: **`product` is 1, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first number in the list**
