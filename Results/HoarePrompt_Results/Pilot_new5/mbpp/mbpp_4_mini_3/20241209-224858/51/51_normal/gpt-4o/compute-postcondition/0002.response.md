The variable `product` is updated by multiplying it with `num`. Initially, `product` is 1, and `num` is the first element in the `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is not empty, `num` has a specific value equal to `numbers[0]`. The value of `product` will therefore become `1 * num`, which is simply `num`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that is not empty, `product` is equal to `num`, `num` is the first element in the `numbers` list.**
