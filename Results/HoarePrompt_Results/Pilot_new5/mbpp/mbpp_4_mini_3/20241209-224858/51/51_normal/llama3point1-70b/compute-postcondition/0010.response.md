The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers or floats named `numbers`, which is assumed to be non-empty. It calculates the product of all elements in the list and then divides that product by the length of the list. However, the code does not handle the case when `numbers` is empty. If `numbers` is indeed empty, the function would attempt to divide `1` by `0`, leading to an undefined operation, which is not properly handled in the code. Therefore, the function's actual behavior may raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if invoked with an empty list, contrary to the annotations stating that the function can return a value even with an empty list.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty list of integers or floats, computes the product of its elements, and returns the product divided by the number of elements in the list. However, if an empty list is provided, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. **
