`product` is updated by multiplying it with `num`. Since `num` is the second element in the `numbers` list, `product` becomes `product * num`, where `product` was previously equal to `num`. Therefore, the new value of `product` will be `num * num`, which is `num**2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 2 elements; `product` is equal to `num**2`; `num` is the second element in the `numbers` list.**
