The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list that contains integers or floats, and the list is not empty. The function calculates the product of all elements in `numbers` and divides that product by the length of `numbers`, returning the resulting value. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-empty list of integers or floats and return the product of its elements divided by the number of elements in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty list of integers or floats and returns the product of all elements in the list divided by the length of the list.**
