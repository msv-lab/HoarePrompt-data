The code assigns `list1` to `list2`. Since `list1` is initially non-empty and `list2` is empty, after the assignment, `list1` will reference the same object as `list2`, which is an empty list. Therefore, `list1` will become empty and `list2` will remain empty as well.

Output State: **`list1` is empty, `list2` is empty**
