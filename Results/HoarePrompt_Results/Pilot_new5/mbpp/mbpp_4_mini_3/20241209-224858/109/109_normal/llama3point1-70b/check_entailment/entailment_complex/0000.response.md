Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the primary issue lies in the handling of the case when `list1` is empty. According to the problem description, the function should only replace the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. However, the code includes an else condition that assigns `list2` to `list1` if `list1` is empty, which contradicts the requirement that `list1` is non-empty. This introduces a scenario where the function's behavior is not aligned with the problem description.

Additionally, the logic in the program uses slicing (`list1[-1:] = list2`), which might not replace the last element exactly as intended; instead, it can change the last element to the entire `list2` if `list2` has multiple elements.

In summary, the program cannot be considered correct because it includes a pathway that modifies `list1` inappropriately when it is empty, contrary to the problem statement. Therefore, it does not consistently fulfill the requirements of replacing the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.
