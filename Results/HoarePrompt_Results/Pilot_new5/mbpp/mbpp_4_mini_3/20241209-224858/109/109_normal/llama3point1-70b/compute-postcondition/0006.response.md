The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists, and `list1` is guaranteed to be non-empty. After executing the function body, the function returns `list1`, which contains all elements of the original `list1` except for the last element that has been replaced by the elements of `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty list `list1` and another list `list2`, and return `list1` with its last element replaced by the contents of `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a non-empty list list1 and a list list2, returning list1 with its last element replaced by the contents of list2.**
