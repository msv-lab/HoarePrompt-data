Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. According to the description, the last element of the first list should be replaced with the elements of the second list. However, the implementation in `func_1` removes the last element of the first list and concatenates it with the second list instead. 

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])`, we would expect the output to be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]` (where 10 is replaced by the elements of the second list), but the actual output is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]` due to the incorrect logic.

Moreover, if `list1` is empty or has only one element, the function will also not behave as expected, leading to further discrepancies. For example:
- `func_1([], [1, 2])` will result in `[1, 2]`, which does not align with any reasonable interpretation of the problem description, as there is no last element to replace.
- `func_1([10], [1, 2])` will result in `[1, 2]`, which again fails to replace the last element of a single-element list correctly.

Thus, the implementation lacks the necessary logic to fully replace the last element with the second list's elements in all potential cases.
