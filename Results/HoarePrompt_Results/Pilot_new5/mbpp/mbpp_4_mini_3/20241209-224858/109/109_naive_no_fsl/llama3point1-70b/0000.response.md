To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

**Problem Description:** 
The function should take two lists and replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        list1 = list2
    return list1
```

1. **When `list1` is not empty:**
   - The code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. This is correct if the intention is to replace the last element of `list1` with the entirety of `list2`.

2. **When `list1` is empty:**
   - The `else` clause `list1 = list2` will not modify `list1` in the original caller's context because lists in Python are mutable, but assigning `list1` to `list2` creates a new reference locally. As a result, the original `list1` remains empty, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

**Potential Case Where It Fails:**
- If `list1` is empty and `list2` is `[1, 2, 3]`, the expected result should be `[1, 2, 3]`, but the actual output will remain `[]` since the assignment does not affect the original list.

Given this analysis, the program does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
