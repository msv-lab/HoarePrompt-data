#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tpl is a tuple.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns a new list that is the combination of the original list 'lst' and the elements of the tuple 'tpl' converted into a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that consists of the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tpl` converted into a list. There are no edge cases regarding input types, as the function assumes that `lst` is always a list and `tpl` is always a tuple. It will raise a TypeError if these assumptions are violated.
