Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that adds the given tuple to the given list. However, the function `func_1` is implemented to return the concatenation of the list and the elements of the tuple converted to a list. 

The key issue here is that it creates a new list containing the elements of both `input_list` and `input_tuple`, rather than modifying `input_list` directly by adding the elements from `input_tuple` into it. The problem description implies that the tuple should be added to the list, which suggests modifying the original list rather than returning a new one.

A correct implementation would modify `input_list` in place by adding the elements of `input_tuple` without creating a new list. For example, using the `extend` method would fulfill this requirement. Thus, the program does not conform to the problem description's requirements, resulting in a correctness evaluation of **False**.
