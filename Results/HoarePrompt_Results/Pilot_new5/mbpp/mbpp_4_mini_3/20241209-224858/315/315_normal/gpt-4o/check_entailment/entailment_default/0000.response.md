The program is designed to add the elements of a tuple to a given list. Let's analyze the code based on the problem description and the output hints.

The program:
```python
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
```
This function takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple to a list, and concatenates it to the original list. 

1. **Initial Assessment Against the Problem Description**: 
   The problem description states that the function should add the given tuple to the given list. The code does this correctly by converting the tuple into a list and appending its elements to the list. 

2. **Consideration of Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle cases where `lst` might not be a list or `tpl` might not be a tuple, leading to a potential TypeError. However, the problem description implies that `lst` is always a list and `tpl` is always a tuple. If these assumptions are violated, a TypeError would occur, which isn't specified as part of the problem's requirements. Therefore, we could assume we are only considering valid inputs as described.
   - It also does not explicitly handle cases of empty tuples or lists, but based on the description, if either is empty, the function should still behave correctly (e.g., `func_1([], ())` would return `[]`).

3. **Output Hints**: 
   The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list and a tuple and returns a new list with the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tpl` converted into a list. The hints also mention that it will raise a TypeError if the input types are violated, which is acceptable based on the description.

Based on the analysis, the code follows the problem description correctly under the assumption of valid input types as specified.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly combines the elements of the list and tuple, adhering to the problem description for all valid inputs.
