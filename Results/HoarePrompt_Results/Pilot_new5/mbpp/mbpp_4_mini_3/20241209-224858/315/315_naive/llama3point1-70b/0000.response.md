Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the requirement of the problem description. The task is to add a given tuple to a given list. The current implementation concatenates the list with the tuple converted to a list, which is not the same as adding the elements of the tuple to the list. 

For example, if we have:

```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
input_tuple = (4, 5)
```

The expected behavior should be that the elements of the tuple (4 and 5) are added to the list, resulting in:

```python
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

However, the function will result in:

```python
[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5]  # This results in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This seems correct, but the true requirement of "add" implies that it should insert the elements rather than create a new list. If we follow the problem's requirement strictly, the program does not define how to handle the in-place addition or if it should modify the original list directly, leading to ambiguity in the result. 

Moreover, if the input list is empty, the program would still return the elements of the tuple as expected, but if the intention was to modify the input_list directly, the return should be omitted. 

Thus, the program does not explicitly handle the case where it should modify the original list, which leads to the conclusion that it does not meet all the potential requirements.
