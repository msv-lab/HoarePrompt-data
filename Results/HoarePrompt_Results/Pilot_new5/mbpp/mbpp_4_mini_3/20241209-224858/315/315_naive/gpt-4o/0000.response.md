Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly adds the elements of a given tuple to a list. It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple (after converting the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`). The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the examples given. 

The function will correctly handle any valid input where a list and a tuple are provided. For example, adding an empty tuple to a list will not change the list, and the function will handle tuples of any size appropriately. There are no edge cases that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description.
