To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem statement, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and the assertions made.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function takes in an array `arr` and an integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the array.
   - If `n < 2`, it returns 0. This case does not find the minimum difference because at least two elements are needed to calculate a difference.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The function sorts the array, which is a valid step because to find the minimum difference, we need to compare adjacent elements after sorting.

3. **Calculating Minimum Difference**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted array and calculates the difference between each pair of adjacent elements.
   - It keeps track of the minimum difference found.

4. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, it returns the minimum difference.

### Assertions:
The assertions in the code are as follows:
- `func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1`
- `func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1`
- `func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4`

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Element**:
   - If the array has only one element, `n` would be 1, and the function would return 0. However, the problem description does not specify what to return in cases where it is impossible to find a difference (i.e., less than two elements).
   - Example: `func_1((10,), 1)` would return 0, but it's logically incorrect because we can't find a difference.

2. **Identical Elements**:
   - If the array contains identical elements, the minimum difference should be 0.
   - Example: `func_1((2, 2, 2), 3)` would return `0`, which is correct. But there should be a check in the code to directly return 0 when all elements are identical.

3. **Handling of Non-integer inputs**:
   - The function assumes the input is always an integer or compatible type. If given floats or other types, the sorting and difference calculation should still work, but this is something to consider depending on the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function handles most cases correctly, but it does not account for cases where there are fewer than two elements properly. The return value of `0` in such cases is not consistent with the problem's requirement to find a minimum difference. Hence, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to handle cases when the number of elements is less than 2 correctly.
