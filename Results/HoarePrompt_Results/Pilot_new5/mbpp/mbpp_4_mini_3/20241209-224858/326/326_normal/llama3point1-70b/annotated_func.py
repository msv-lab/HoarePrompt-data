#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, and `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It computes and returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `arr`. The variable `target` is not used in the logic of the function and does not influence the output. Additionally, the function assumes that `arr` contains at least two elements; if `arr` has fewer than two elements, it may lead to an incorrect result or error since the difference calculation requires at least two values.
