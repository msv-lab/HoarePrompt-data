The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which calculates the difference between the consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` at the index `i` and `i + 1`. The initial state suggests that `i` is 0, so `diff` will be equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]**.
