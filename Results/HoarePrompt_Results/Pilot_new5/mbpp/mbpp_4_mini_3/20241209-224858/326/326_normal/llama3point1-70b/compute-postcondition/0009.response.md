The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`. The other variables `arr`, `target`, `i`, and `diff` remain unchanged. Hence, the output state reflects the updated value of `min_diff`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `i` is 1, `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`.**
