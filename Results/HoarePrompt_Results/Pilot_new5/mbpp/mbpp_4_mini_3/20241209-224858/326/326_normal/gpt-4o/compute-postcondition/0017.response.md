Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `min_diff` remains positive infinity, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then the program acknowledges that condition, otherwise the program does nothing due to the error that occurs from index out of range when calculating `diff`.***
