To analyze the code provided, we start with the initial state:

- `arr` is a sorted list of integers
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `min_diff` is positive infinity
- `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`
- `i` is `n - 1`

Now let's evaluate the impact of the code:

```
diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
```

- The value of `i` is `n - 1`, so `i + 1` equals `n`. This means that `arr[i + 1]` refers to `arr[n]`, which is out of bounds since valid indices for `arr` are from `0` to `n - 1`. Therefore, this code will likely raise an IndexError or similar exception. However, assuming the code could run without errors, we would compute `diff` as `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`.

Since `arr[n]` is out of bounds, we must conclude that the execution cannot proceed successfully. Therefore, there are no valid updates to the values of the variables.

Given this analysis, we can state the output state without any changes made to the variables because the code execution is not valid.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is `n - 1` and the code resulted in an IndexError or similar exception due to out-of-bounds access.**
