According to the code, the loop iterates based on the length of the `arr`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` is 1. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, the length of `arr` is at least 3, making `len(arr) - 1` at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 2. 

Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, `i` should be 2, and `arr` still remains a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements. The value of `target` and `min_diff` can remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop progression.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[3]` if `arr[3]` exists, otherwise it remains as the previous value.**
