Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements from the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array, whereas the program only calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Minimum Difference Calculation**: The approach taken by the program only considers differences between adjacent elements after sorting the array. However, the minimum difference can occur between any two elements, not just consecutive ones. For example, in the array `(30, 5, 20, 9)`, the minimum difference is between `20` and `30` (which is `10`), but since they are not consecutive in the sorted array, the program would return a minimum difference of `4`, which is incorrect.

2. **Output for n < 2**: The program returns `0` if `n < 2`, but the problem description does not specify what should be returned in this case. Ideally, if there are fewer than two elements, the function should indicate that no valid difference can be computed, perhaps by returning `None` or raising an exception.

Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the problem requirement to find the minimum difference between any two elements, leading to an incorrect output in certain cases. Hence, the program fails to meet the problem description requirements.
