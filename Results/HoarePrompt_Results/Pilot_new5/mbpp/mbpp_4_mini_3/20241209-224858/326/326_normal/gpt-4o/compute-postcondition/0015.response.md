The value of `i` is `n - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the sorted list `arr`. When we execute `diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`, we are trying to access the element at index `i + 1`, which is out of bounds since `i` is the last index of the array. This will cause an error due to index out of range. Therefore, the preconditions remain unchanged because we can't assign a value to `diff`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `min_diff` remains positive infinity, `i` is `n - 1, and an error occurs due to index out of range when calculating `diff`.**
