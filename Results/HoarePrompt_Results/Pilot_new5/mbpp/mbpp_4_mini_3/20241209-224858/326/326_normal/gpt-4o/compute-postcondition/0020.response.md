The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of `arr`. 

If `n` is less than 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is 2 or greater, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n`, and return 0 if `n` is less than 2, or the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted `arr` if `n` is 2 or greater. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n`. It returns 0 if `n` is less than 2; otherwise, it returns the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.**
