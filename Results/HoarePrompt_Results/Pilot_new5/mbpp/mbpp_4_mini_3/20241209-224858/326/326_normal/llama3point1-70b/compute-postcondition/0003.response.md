The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between the two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`, specifically `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. The value of `i` is 0, so the calculation is `diff = abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])**
