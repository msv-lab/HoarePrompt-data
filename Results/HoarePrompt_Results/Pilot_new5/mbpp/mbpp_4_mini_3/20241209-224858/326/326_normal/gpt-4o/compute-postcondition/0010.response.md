According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2`, which means it will execute `n - 1` times in total. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index of the loop, which must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute again. 

Since the state indicates that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, at the end of the last iteration, the loop will have executed with `i` being `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming `n - 1`, and `n` must remain at least `2` to ensure the loop condition is still valid.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is `n - 1`**.
