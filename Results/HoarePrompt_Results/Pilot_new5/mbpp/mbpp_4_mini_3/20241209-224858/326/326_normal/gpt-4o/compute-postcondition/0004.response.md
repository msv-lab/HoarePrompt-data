The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This does not affect any of the other variables, but it initializes `min_diff` to a value that can be compared with actual integer differences later in the program. The previous values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `min_diff` is set to positive infinity.**
