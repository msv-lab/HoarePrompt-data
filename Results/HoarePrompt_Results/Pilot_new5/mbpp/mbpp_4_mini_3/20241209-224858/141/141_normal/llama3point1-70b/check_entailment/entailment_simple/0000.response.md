Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The issue lies in how the frequency of digits is counted. The use of `str_n.count(digit)` counts the occurrences of `digit` in the string representation of the integer, but if `digit` is '0', the program would incorrectly allow the function to return `True` if the count of '0' is 0 (which is valid) but doesn't account for the fact that the digit '0' should not appear at all in the integer if it is to satisfy the condition that the frequency of a digit must not exceed its value.

For example, if `n = 100`, the function will find that:
- For '1', the count is 1 (which is <= 1)
- For '0', the count is 2 (which is not <= 0)

However, the function will return True because it evaluates the counts separately. Therefore, the program fails to capture cases correctly where the digit '0' exists and its count exceeds its value.

Due to this logic flaw, the program does not fulfill the requirements set by the problem description.
