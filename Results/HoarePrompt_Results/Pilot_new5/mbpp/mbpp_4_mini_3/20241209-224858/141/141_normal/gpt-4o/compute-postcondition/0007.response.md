Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`. If `digit` is already a key in `frequency`, then the value of `frequency[digit]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `digit` is added as a key in `frequency` with a value of 1.***
