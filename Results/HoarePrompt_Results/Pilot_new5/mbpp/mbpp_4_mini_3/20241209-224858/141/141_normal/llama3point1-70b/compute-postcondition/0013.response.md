The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function has several return points: if the specified conditions in the program are met, it returns `False` in Cases 1, 2, and 3. In Case 4, the function returns `True`, indicating that the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` (denoted as 'str_n') is less than or equal to its integer value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `False` or `True` based on the conditions evaluated within the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `False` if certain conditions are met; otherwise, it returns `True` if the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to its integer value.**
