The variable `digit_str` is assigned the value of `str(n)`, which converts the non-negative integer `n` into its string representation. The initial state remains valid, and only the new value of `digit_str` is affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`**.
