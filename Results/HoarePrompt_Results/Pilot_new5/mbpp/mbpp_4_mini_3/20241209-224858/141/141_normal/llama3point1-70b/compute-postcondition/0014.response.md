Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks whether the count of each digit in its string representation is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. If any digit's count exceeds its integer value, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. The function does not handle invalid inputs, such as negative integers, as it is designed only for non-negative integers. **
