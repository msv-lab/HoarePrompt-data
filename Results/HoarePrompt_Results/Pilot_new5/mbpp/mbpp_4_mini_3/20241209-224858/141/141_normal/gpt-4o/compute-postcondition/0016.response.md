Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `frequency` is a dictionary where each key is a digit from `digit_str` and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that digit in `digit_str`. If `n` is 0, then `digit_str` is "0" and `frequency` would be `{'0': 1}`.**
