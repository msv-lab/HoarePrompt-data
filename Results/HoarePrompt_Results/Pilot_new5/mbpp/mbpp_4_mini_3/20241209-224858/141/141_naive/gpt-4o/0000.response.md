To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program `func_1`.

The problem states that we need to check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. 

### Breakdown of the Program:
1. The function converts the integer `n` into a string to iterate over each digit.
2. It constructs a frequency dictionary that counts occurrences of each digit.
3. It then checks if the count of each digit exceeds the digit itself (converted to an integer).

### Cases to Consider:
- The digits in the integer can be `0` through `9`.
- The frequency of each digit must not exceed the value of the digit itself.

### Test Cases:
- `1234`: Each digit appears once (1, 2, 3, 4) which is acceptable. **Returns True**.
- `51241`: The digit `2` appears twice, which exceeds the digit value of `2` itself. **Returns False**.
- `321`: Each digit appears once (3, 2, 1) which is acceptable. **Returns True**.

### Edge Cases:
- The number `0`: The function doesn't handle the case of the digit `0`, which can never have a frequency greater than itself because its frequency cannot be greater than `0`. If `0` appears, the function would incorrectly return `False` since the frequency of `0` would be `1` (assuming 0 is counted, which it would be if part of a larger number) while `0` cannot have a frequency greater than its value.

For example, if the input is `100`, the frequency dictionary would be `{'1': 1, '0': 2}`. The digit `0` appears twice, but since `0` is not allowed to have a frequency greater than `0`, this should return `False`, but the current program would not check it correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the edge case involving the digit `0`, which should always result in a `False` if it appears with a frequency greater than `0`.

Correctness: **False**.
