To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, I will analyze the function against the problem description: "Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists."

### Program:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The program uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist in `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function on each sublist.
2. **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function sorts strings in lexicographical order by default.

### Testing the Provided Assertions:
- The first assertion checks if the function correctly sorts the sublists `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])`. The expected output is `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. However, the actual sorted results would be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which is actually correct.
  
- The second assertion `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])` is expected to yield `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`. The actual sorted output would be `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`, which also matches.

- The third assertion `(['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])` expects `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`. When sorted, the function produces `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`, which is correct.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Sublist**: If a sublist is empty (e.g., `[[], ['a', 'b']]`), the function should return `[[], ['a', 'b']]`. This works as expected.
2. **Sublist with Single Element**: For a sublist like `[["only_one"]]`, the output should also be `[["only_one"]]`, which is correct.
3. **Whitespace Handling**: The function does not trim whitespace before sorting, which could lead to unexpected order if leading or trailing spaces are present. For instance, the input `[['  a', 'a', ' b'], ['c']]` should return `[['  a', ' b', 'a'], ['c']]`, while a more intuitive sort might expect leading spaces to be ignored.

### Conclusion:
While the function sorts individual sublists correctly in the provided assertions, it does not handle whitespace in an intuitive manner. Given that the problem description doesn't specify how to treat leading and trailing whitespace, there might be ambiguity and inconsistency in sorting behavior based on how whitespace is handled.

Correctness: **False**.  
The program does not account for leading and trailing spaces, which could lead to confusion or unexpected results in sorting.
