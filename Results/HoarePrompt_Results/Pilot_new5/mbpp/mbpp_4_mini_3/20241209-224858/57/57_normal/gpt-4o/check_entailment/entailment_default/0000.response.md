To evaluate the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, I will analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The task is to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

### Initial Assessment of the Code
1. The code appears to iterate over each sublist in the `list_of_lists`.
2. It uses Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort each sublist in ascending order.
3. The result is a new list of sorted sublists, which maintains the structure of the input.

### Edge Cases
- **Empty Sublists**: The code should handle empty sublists correctly, and the description states that it does. An empty sublist will remain an empty sublist after sorting.
- **Whitespace Handling**: The strings may contain leading or trailing spaces, which could affect sorting. It is unclear from the description how this should be handled. The `sorted()` function will sort them based on their ASCII values, meaning spaces will precede alphabetic characters.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Sorting is case-sensitive, meaning 'Zebra' will come before 'apple' due to ASCII values. The problem description does not specify how case sensitivity should be handled.

### Output Hints
The output hints say:
- The function accepts a list of lists containing strings and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order.
- The function handles empty sublists correctly by returning them as is.

### Agreement with Output Hints
- The code does indeed sort each sublist and handles empty sublists correctly, aligning with the hints provided.
- However, the output hints do not address the potential issues with whitespace and case sensitivity, which are relevant edge cases that the program may not handle as implied by the description.

### Conclusion
Since there are edge cases concerning whitespace and case sensitivity that the program does not explicitly manage, we can conclude that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases of whitespace and case sensitivity as needed, which could lead to incorrect sorting outcomes in those scenarios.
