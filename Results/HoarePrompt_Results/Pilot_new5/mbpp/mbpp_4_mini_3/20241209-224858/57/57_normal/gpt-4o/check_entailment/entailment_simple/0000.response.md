Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The issue lies in the handling of leading or trailing spaces in the strings within the sublists. The `sorted()` function in Python sorts strings based on their character values, and leading or trailing spaces will affect the sort order.

For example, consider the assertion:
```python
assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], [' blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
```
The expected output suggests that strings with spaces should be retained in their original form after sorting. However, the actual output will include the strings sorted with spaces considered, leading to a different result.

Thus, the program does not correctly sort each sublist of strings as specified, since it does not account for potential variations in string formatting. Specifically, the presence of leading and trailing spaces affects the sort order, which contradicts the expectations set forth in the problem description.
