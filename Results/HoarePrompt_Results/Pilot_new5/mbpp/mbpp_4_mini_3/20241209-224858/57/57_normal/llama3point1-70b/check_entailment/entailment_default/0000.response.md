The problem description states that the function should sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The provided program implements this functionality using a list comprehension and the `sorted` function with a case-insensitive key (`str.lower`).

Initially, the code appears to satisfy the problem description by sorting the strings in each sublist without regard to case sensitivity. 

However, it is important to consider edge cases. The output hints indicate that the function does not handle empty sublists, which remain as empty lists in the output. This means if an input list of lists contains empty sublists, they will not be altered, and the function will return them as they are. This does not violate the requirement as per the description, since sorting an empty list results in another empty list.

Now, checking the output hints, they state that the function accepts a list of lists where each sublist contains strings and returns a new list of lists with each sublist sorted in a case-insensitive manner. They also correctly note that empty sublists are returned unchanged, which is consistent with the behavior of the `sorted` function in Python.

Since the output hints accurately reflect what the program does and the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases (including those with empty sublists), there are no cases where the program does not work as expected.

Thus, the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
