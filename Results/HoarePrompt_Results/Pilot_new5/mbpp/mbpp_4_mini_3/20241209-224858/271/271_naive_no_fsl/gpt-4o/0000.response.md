To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description and test it against various input scenarios.

The problem requires a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The function first determines the number of elements in the first tuple: `num_elements = len(tuples[0])`.
2. It initializes an empty list `averages` to store the average values.
3. It iterates over the index of the elements (`for i in range(num_elements):`).
4. For each index, it creates a list of values at that index from all tuples: `elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`.
5. It calculates the average of these values using `avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.
6. Finally, it appends the average to the `averages` list and returns the list.

### Testing Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case with Empty Tuple**: What if the input is an empty tuple? The function would attempt to access `tuples[0]`, which will raise an `IndexError`.
- **Case with Uneven Length Tuples**: If the tuples have different lengths, the function will also fail with an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that doesn’t exist in all tuples.

### Example of Failure Cases:
- Input: `func_1(())` — This would raise an `IndexError` since there are no elements to access.
- Input: `func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))` — This will also raise an `IndexError` because the second tuple has more elements than the first.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the cases of empty input or uneven tuple lengths. Since it fails to account for these scenarios, I conclude that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
