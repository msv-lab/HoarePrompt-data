The variable `avg` is assigned the value of `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`. The `elements_at_position` has been previously defined as a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`. Since `tuples` has at least one inner tuple and `num_elements` is at least 2, `len(tuples)` will return a value of at least 1. Therefore, `avg` will be the sum of the second elements divided by the number of inner tuples.

The states of the other variables are not affected; they remain the same after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple, `num_elements` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`, `averages` now includes the value of `avg`.**
