According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_elements`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `num_elements`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `num_elements` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will become 1. Therefore, `num_elements` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple, `num_elements` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is the average of `elements_at_position`, `averages` now includes the value of `avg`.**
