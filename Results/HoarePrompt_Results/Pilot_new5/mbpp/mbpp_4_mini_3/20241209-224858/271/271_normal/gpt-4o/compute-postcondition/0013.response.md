The code `averages.append(avg)` appends the value of `avg` to the `averages` list. The previous state of `avg` is already defined as a numeric value equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`. Since the `averages` list is now updated to include this new value, the output state reflects this addition.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple, `num_elements` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is a numeric value equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` includes the value of `avg` which has been appended.**
