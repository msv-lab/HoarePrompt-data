To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze them carefully.

**Problem description**: The task is to write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

**Output hints**: The function accepts a tuple of tuples, each containing numerical values, and returns a list of averages for each position across the inner tuples. Specifically, it sums the values at each position and divides by the number of inner tuples. If the input tuple is empty, it will return an empty list, and if any inner tuple contains non-numeric values, it may raise a TypeError during the calculation.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to group the values at corresponding positions from each inner tuple, which is appropriate for calculating averages.
2. It sums the values at each position and divides by the number of inner tuples (`len(tuples)`), which correctly implements the average calculation.
3. The code seems to handle the empty tuple case by returning an empty list, as `zip(*tuples)` would yield nothing, leading to an empty list comprehension.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
1. **Empty input**: If `tuples` is empty, the function returns an empty list, which is correct.
2. **Non-numeric values**: If any inner tuple contains non-numeric values, a `TypeError` will occur during the summation, which is not gracefully handled by the function (i.e., it doesn't catch exceptions).
3. **Different lengths of inner tuples**: The code does not handle cases where the inner tuples are of different lengths. This would lead to an error as `zip` will only iterate over the shortest inner tuple, and it won't compute averages for all positions if any tuple is shorter than the others.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output hints accurately describe the function's operation, including the empty input case and the potential for a `TypeError`. The hints indicate the function will not handle non-numeric values properly.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it does not handle:
- Non-numeric values gracefully (it could catch exceptions).
- Unequal lengths of inner tuples, which could lead to incomplete averages.

Since the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, the correctness of the program is evaluated as follows:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program will fail with a `TypeError` if non-numeric values are present or will not compute averages for all positions when inner tuples have different lengths.
