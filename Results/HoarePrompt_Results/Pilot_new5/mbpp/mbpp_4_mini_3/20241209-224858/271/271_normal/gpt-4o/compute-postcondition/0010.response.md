According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num_elements`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `num_elements`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `num_elements` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to allow another iteration, `num_elements` must be at least 3.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple, `num_elements` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`, `averages` now includes the value of `avg`**
