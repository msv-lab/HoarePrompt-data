To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the program in light of the requirements stated:

### Problem Description:
The function must take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, the average of values from all tuples at that position should be computed.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```
### Explanation of the Program:
1. **Input**: The function takes `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values.
2. **Zip function**: The use of `zip(*tuples)` effectively transposes the tuple of tuples, creating a new iterable where each element corresponds to the values from each inner tuple at the same index.
3. **List comprehension**: The program iterates over each transposed group of values (`val`) and calculates the average by summing the values and dividing by the number of inner tuples (`len(tuples)`).
4. **Output**: It returns a list of averages for each position.

### Evaluation Against Problem Description:
- The program correctly computes the average for each position across all inner tuples.
- By using `zip(*tuples)`, it ensures that each group of corresponding elements from the inner tuples is processed together.
- The calculation of the average (`sum(val) / len(tuples)`) is accurate given that `val` contains all the values at a particular index from each inner tuple.

### Conclusion:
The program does meet the requirements outlined in the problem description under all normal circumstances (assuming that the input is valid). It correctly averages values from each corresponding position in the inner tuples.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly implements the specification by returning a list of averages for each position across the tuples.
