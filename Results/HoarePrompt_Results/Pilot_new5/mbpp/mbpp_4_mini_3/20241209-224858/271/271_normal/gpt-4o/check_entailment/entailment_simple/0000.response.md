Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of tuples, which is consistent with the requirements. Each inner tuple is expected to contain numeric values of the same length.

2. **Average Calculation**: The program iterates over each index `i` corresponding to the positions of the inner tuples. For each position, it gathers the values from all tuples at that position using a list comprehension (`elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`).

3. **Summation and Division**: The program calculates the average of the gathered values using `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, which correctly follows the mathematical definition of an average.

4. **Output Format**: The final result is returned as a list of averages, which matches the expected output format described in the problem statement.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertion statements provided as test cases demonstrate that the function returns the expected results for various inputs, confirming its correctness across different scenarios.

Overall, the program adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description, ensuring it will handle any valid tuple of tuples as described.
