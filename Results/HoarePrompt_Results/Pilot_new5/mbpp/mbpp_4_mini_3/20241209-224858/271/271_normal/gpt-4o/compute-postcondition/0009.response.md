The `averages` list is updated by appending the value of `avg`. Since `avg` is defined as the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`, the exact value of `avg` is retained while `averages` now includes this value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple, `num_elements` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`, `averages` now includes the value of `avg`.
