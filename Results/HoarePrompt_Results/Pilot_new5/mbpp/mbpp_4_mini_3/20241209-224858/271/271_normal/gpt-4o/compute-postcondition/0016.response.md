The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length. After executing the function body, it calculates the averages of each position across all inner tuples in `tuples` and returns a list called 'averages'. The length of this list 'averages' is equal to `num_elements`, which corresponds to the number of elements in each inner tuple. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and return a list of averages for each position across the inner tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples, which is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, and returns a list of averages of each position across all inner tuples.**
