The code creates a new list, `elements_at_position`, which consists of the second elements (index `i`, where `i` is 2) from each inner tuple in `tuples`. Given that `tuples` is a tuple of tuples and must have at least one inner tuple, `elements_at_position` will now contain the second elements from all the inner tuples in `tuples`. The values of `num_elements`, `avg`, and `averages` remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple, `num_elements` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`, and `averages` now includes the value of `avg`.**
