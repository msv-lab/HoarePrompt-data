Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the tuples have different lengths. For example, consider the input `((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`. The program will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access an index that does not exist in the shorter tuple.

Since the program does not handle this edge case and can fail for certain inputs, it is incorrect.
