Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and uses a list comprehension to iterate through each integer in the list. It checks whether each integer is even by using the modulo operator (`% 2 == 0`). If a number is even, it is included in the returned list.

This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to find even numbers from a list. The program will successfully return a list of all even integers contained in the input list, regardless of the list's content (including edge cases like an empty list or a list containing no even numbers). Thus, it meets the problem's requirements consistently and correctly.
