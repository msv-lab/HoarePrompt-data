Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While the function `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from a list of integers, it does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the input list contains non-integer elements. 

For example, if the input to `func_1` is a list that contains non-integer values (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, '3', 4, 5])`), the function will raise a `TypeError` when it attempts to perform the modulo operation on the string '3'. This failure to handle non-integer elements or to validate the input type means that the function does not robustly follow the problem description, which could be interpreted as needing to handle any list of numbers.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the requirements for all potential input cases, leading to an overall assessment of **False**.
