Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from a list of integers. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `numbers` and checks if the number is even by evaluating the condition `num % 2 == 0`. If the condition is true, the number is included in the resultant list.

I have considered potential cases, such as:

1. An empty list: `func_1([])` returns `[]`, which is correct.
2. A list with all even numbers: `func_1([2, 4, 6])` returns `[2, 4, 6]`, which is correct.
3. A list with all odd numbers: `func_1([1, 3, 5])` returns `[]`, which is correct.
4. A mixed list: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`, which is correct.

Given that the function handles these cases as expected and no edge cases or missing logic are apparent, the function indeed fulfills the problem description accurately.
