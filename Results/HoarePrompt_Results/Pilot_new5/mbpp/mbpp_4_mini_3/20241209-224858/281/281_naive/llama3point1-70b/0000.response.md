Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly finds all even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list and checks if it is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder) using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This logic correctly identifies all even numbers, regardless of the input, including negative numbers, zeros, and large integers. Since I cannot identify any potential cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
