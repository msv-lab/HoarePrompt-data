Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from the input list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the list and includes it in the output list if it is even (i.e., if `num % 2 == 0`). 

The assertions provided as test cases confirm that the function works for the following inputs:
1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`, which correctly identifies the even numbers.
2. `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])` returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, also correctly identifying all even numbers.
3. `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19])` returns `[8, 12]`, which correctly captures the even numbers.

No edge cases or potential inputs have been identified where the function fails or does not adhere to the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct for the stated requirements.
