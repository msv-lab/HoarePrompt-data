Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the function to find the smallest number in a list using Python's built-in `min()` function. This function will successfully return the smallest element from the list of numbers for all valid input cases.

1. **Valid Input**: If `nums` is a non-empty list of numbers, `min(nums)` will return the smallest number as expected.
2. **Empty List Case**: However, it is crucial to note that if `nums` is an empty list (`[]`), calling `min()` would raise a `ValueError`. Since the problem description doesn't specify handling for empty lists, the program fails for this case.

Since there is at least one input case (an empty list) that the program does not handle correctly, the correctness of the program is deemed False. 

Therefore, taking this into account:

Correctness: **False**.
