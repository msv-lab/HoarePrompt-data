The code provided defines a function `func_1` that utilizes Python's built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. The assertions provided test the function with different lists, and they all return the expected minimum values.

Initially assessing the code against the problem description, the function appears to meet the requirements of finding the smallest number in a list. However, the problem description does not mention how the function should behave when provided with an empty list.

Next, examining the output hints, they indicate that the function does not handle the case of an empty list and that invoking `min` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError`. This aligns with the behavior of the `min` function, confirming that the hints are indeed valid and properly reflect a potential edge case.

Since the function lacks handling for the empty list case, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, we can conclude that the program does not meet the requirements as it will fail when an empty list is passed.

Correctness: **False**.
