The provided program aims to find the smallest number in a given list of numbers. 

Examining the code:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
```
This code uses Python's built-in `min()` function, which returns the smallest item from an iterable (in this case, a list). However, if the list is empty, calling `min()` will raise a `ValueError`, which is not handled within the function.

Now, let's analyze the problem description. The problem states that the function should find the smallest number in a list. It does not specify how to handle an empty list explicitly. 

The output hints clarify that if the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` since the `min()` function cannot operate on an empty sequence. This behavior is accurate and aligns with Python's standard behavior, but it could be considered an oversight since the problem description does not mention that the function should raise an error for an empty list.

The code does work correctly in finding the smallest number when the list is not empty, returning the expected minimum value. However, it fails to handle the edge case of an empty list according to common expectations of how such a function should behave.

Based on the analysis:
- The function does not adequately address the edge case for an empty list.
- The output hints confirm that the function will raise an error for an empty input, which is a valid point but ultimately indicates that the function does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The issue arises because the function does not handle the case of an empty list, which is typically expected behavior for a function of this nature.
