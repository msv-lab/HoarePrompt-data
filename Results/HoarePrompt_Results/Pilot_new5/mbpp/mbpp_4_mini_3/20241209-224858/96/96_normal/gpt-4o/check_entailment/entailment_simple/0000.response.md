To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the functionality of the `func_1` function in relation to the requirement of checking if all elements in a tuple have the same data type.

### Analysis of the function

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input.

2. **Empty Tuple Case**:
   - The first condition checks if `tup` is empty. If it is, the function returns `True`. This behavior is consistent with the common definition of type consistency, as an empty tuple has no elements to compare.
   
3. **Type Checking**:
   - The function then stores the type of the first element in `first_type`.
   - It iterates through each element in the tuple `tup`, comparing the type of each element to `first_type`.
   - If any element's type does not match `first_type`, the function returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple are of the same type.

### Validation Against Problem Description

The **problem description** states that the function must check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The program seems to follow this description since:
- It correctly identifies the type of the first element and checks all other elements against this type.
- It handles empty tuples by returning `True`, which can be considered appropriate for this problem.

### Edge Cases Covered:
- The function handles tuples with mixed data types (like `(1, 2, '4')`), returning `False` as expected.
- It correctly identifies tuples with the same data type (like `(5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)`), returning `True`.
- It correctly checks for tuples that contain only one type of item.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` handles all possible cases as laid out in the problem description, including empty tuples, mixed types, and homogeneous types.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
