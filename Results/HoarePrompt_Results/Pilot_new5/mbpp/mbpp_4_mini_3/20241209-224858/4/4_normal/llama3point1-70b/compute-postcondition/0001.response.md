The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `num1` and `num2`. Both `num1` and `num2` are non-negative integers. After executing the function body, it checks if `num1` and `num2` differ by exactly one bit in their binary representation. If they do, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, and return `True` if they differ by exactly one bit in their binary representation, and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters num1 and num2, returns True if num1 and num2 differ by exactly one bit in their binary representation; otherwise, it returns False.**
