To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1`.

The task requires us to check whether two numbers differ at only one bit position. The provided code uses the XOR operation to determine this:

1. It calculates the XOR of the two numbers `a` and `b` using `xor_result = a ^ b`. The result of XOR will have bits set to `1` where the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` differ.
2. It checks if `xor_result` is not equal to `0`, which ensures that the two numbers are not identical.
3. Finally, it checks if `xor_result` has exactly one bit set by using the condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`. This condition is true if there is exactly one bit that is `1` in `xor_result`.

The assertions provided in the code serve to check various cases:
- `func_1(13, 9)` should return `True` because their binary representations differ at only one bit.
- `func_1(15, 8)` should return `False` because they differ in multiple bit positions.
- `func_1(2, 4)` should return `False` as they differ in two positions.
- `func_1(2, 3)` should return `True` because they differ at one position.
- `func_1(5, 1)` and `func_1(1, 5)` should both return `True` as they differ at one position.

Now, let's analyze if there could be any edge cases or if the implementation has any flaws:

1. If both inputs are the same, `func_1` returns `False`, which is correct since they do not differ at any position.
2. For the input pair which differs across multiple bits, such as `func_1(3, 6)`, the code would also return `False`, which is correct.
3. However, let's consider a case where one number is zero, say `func_1(0, 1)`. The XOR would be `1`, which means they differ at one bit position. In this case, the function correctly identifies they differ at one bit position.

Overall, all test assertions seem to pass according to the problem description. There are no edge cases identified where the code fails.

Since I cannot think of a case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
