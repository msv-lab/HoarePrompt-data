Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to count the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. The function `func_1(s)` is defined to take a single string argument `s`.
2. Inside the function, it uses the `count()` method of string objects, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'std' within the string `s`.
3. The assertions provided serve as test cases that verify the correctness of the function. Each test case checks for various scenarios:
   - The first assertion checks a string with multiple occurrences of 'std' and expects a count of 3.
   - The second assertion checks for a single occurrence and expects 1.
   - The third checks for two occurrences and expects 2.
   - The fourth checks a string that contains only 'std' and expects 1.
   - The fifth checks an empty string and expects 0.

Since the implementation uses the `count()` method correctly and the assertions cover a variety of scenarios, the program will produce the expected results for all cases outlined in the problem description. Thus, it correctly fulfills the requirements.
