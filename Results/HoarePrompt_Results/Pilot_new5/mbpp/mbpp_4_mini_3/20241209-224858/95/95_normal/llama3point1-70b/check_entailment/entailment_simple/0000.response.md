Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input and uses the string method `count()` to count the occurrences of the substring 'std' within that string. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function explicitly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std', which is exactly what the problem description requires.

2. **Return Value**: It returns an integer representing the count of 'std' in the input string. Since the problem description asks for counting occurrences, this aligns perfectly with the expected behavior.

3. **General Case Handling**: The `count()` method will accurately count overlapping and non-overlapping occurrences of 'std', effectively satisfying any case where 'std' may appear in the input string.

Thus, there are no scenarios where the program would fail to fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
