Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality to count occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string using Python's built-in `count()` method. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including:

1. A string with multiple occurrences of 'std' (`'letstdlenstdporstd'`).
2. A string with one occurrence (`'truststdsolensporsd'`).
3. A string with two occurrences (`'makestdsostdworthit'`).
4. A string that contains only 'std' (`'stds'`).
5. An empty string which correctly returns 0.

Given these considerations, the function behaves as expected for all tested inputs and adheres to the problem description. Since no edge cases have been found that would lead to incorrect behavior, the program is deemed correct.
