Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The implementation uses the `count` method of the string, which accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring.

The assertions provided test various scenarios:
1. `'letstdlenstdporstd'` correctly returns `3`, as 'std' appears three times.
2. `'truststdsolensporsd'` correctly returns `1`, as 'std' appears once.
3. `'makestdsostdworthit'` correctly returns `2`, as 'std' appears twice.
4. `'stds'` correctly returns `1`, as 'std' appears once.
5. `''` correctly returns `0`, as the input string is empty.

The function handles all potential cases, including:
- Strings with multiple occurrences of 'std'.
- Strings containing 'std' at the beginning, middle, and end.
- Strings without 'std'.
- An empty string input.

Since all cases are handled correctly and conform to the problem description, the program is correct.
