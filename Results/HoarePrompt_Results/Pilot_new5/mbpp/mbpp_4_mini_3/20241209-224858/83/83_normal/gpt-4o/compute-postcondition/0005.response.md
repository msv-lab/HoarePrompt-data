According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop starts at 1 and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, which means that `i` must be incremented to determine if the loop can run again. Since we start at `i = 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must remain greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` remains 0, `i` is 2**
