The variable `max_index` is assigned the index of the maximum element from the first `size` elements of `arr`. The value of `size` is equal to `n`, which is greater than 0. Therefore, `max_index` will be the index of the maximum value within the first `n` elements of `arr`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`.**
