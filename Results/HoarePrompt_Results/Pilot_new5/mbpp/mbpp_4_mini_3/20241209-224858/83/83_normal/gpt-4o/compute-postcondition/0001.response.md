To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to understand the conditions under which the loop operates. 

1. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and iterates up to `n-1`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (as it should have at least the value 2 to allow the range to produce a valid sequence of integers).

2. The initial state indicates that `max_index` is 0, which is not necessarily relevant for the loop's execution but may be important for subsequent logic (though we only focus on the execution of the loop).

3. The starting value of `i` is 1, which is the first value in the range, meaning we can directly state that when the loop starts, `i` will be set to 1.

Considering these points, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, the necessary conditions for the state before the loop begins are as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**
