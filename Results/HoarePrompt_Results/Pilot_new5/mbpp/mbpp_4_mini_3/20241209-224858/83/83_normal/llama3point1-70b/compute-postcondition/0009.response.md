According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `size`, which is initialized to `n` and decrements with each iteration. The loop will continue as long as `size` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is `n`, which is greater than 0. 

In the next iteration, `size` will be decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be decremented to `n - 1`. Additionally, `arr` remains a list of elements that can be compared, and `n` remains greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`**
