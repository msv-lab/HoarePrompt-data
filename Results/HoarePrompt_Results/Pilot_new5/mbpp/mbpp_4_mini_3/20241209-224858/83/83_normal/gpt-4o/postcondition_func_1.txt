The function accepts a non-negative integer `end` and reverses the elements of a global list `arr` from index `0` to `end`. It does not use a `start` parameter directly as an input; instead, it initializes `start` to `0` within the function. The function will not perform any action if `end` is `0` or if `end` is less than `0` since the while loop will not execute in such cases.
