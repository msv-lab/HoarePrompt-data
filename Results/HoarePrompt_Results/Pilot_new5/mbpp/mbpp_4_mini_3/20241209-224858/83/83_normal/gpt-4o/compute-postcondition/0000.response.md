The code assigns the value `0` to `max_index`. Since `max_index` was not previously defined, this is its first assignment. The initial state of `n` and `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `arr`, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 0**
