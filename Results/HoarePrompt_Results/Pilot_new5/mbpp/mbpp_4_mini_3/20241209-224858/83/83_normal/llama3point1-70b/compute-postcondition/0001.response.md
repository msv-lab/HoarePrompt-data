According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is the length of the array `arr`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `size` will start at `n` and will decrease by 1 with each iteration of the loop.

Since `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, the loop's execution also implies that `arr` is not empty, meaning `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` will start at `n`, and `arr` must be a list of elements that can be compared.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
