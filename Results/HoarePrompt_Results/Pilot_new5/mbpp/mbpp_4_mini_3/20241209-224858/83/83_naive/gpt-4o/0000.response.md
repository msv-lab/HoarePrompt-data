Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` is expected to sort a list of elements, but it has multiple issues that prevent it from working correctly:

1. The `flip` and `find_max_index` functions reference `arr`, but `arr` is not defined in their scope. This will lead to a `NameError` when they are called.
   
2. The main sorting logic in `func_1` relies on flipping elements to sort the array, but since the array is not correctly passed to the helper functions, it won't produce the desired results.

3. The implementation of the flipping and finding maximum index does not guarantee that the entire list will be sorted. The algorithm seems to be based on a variation of pancake sorting but is improperly implemented.

As a specific case, if you call `func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69])`, it will fail due to `arr` being undefined in the helper functions. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description requirements for all potential cases.
