To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the code against the problem description, which states that it should sort a list of elements.

Program:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
    return arr
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting Logic**: The method used here appears to implement a sort using the selection sort concept with a reversal method (similar to pancake sorting). The outer loop iterates from the entire list down to one element.
2. **Reversals**: The code attempts to reverse sublists to move the maximum element found to its correct position at the end of the considered portion of the list.
3. **Edge Cases**: There are several potential issues:
   - If the list has duplicate maximum elements, the `max_index` will only return the first occurrence, which might lead to incorrect sorting.
   - The algorithm does not handle lists with negative numbers or mixed types (e.g., integers and strings) correctly, as `max()` will raise an error when comparing incompatible types.

### Example of Failure:
Let's take an example:
```python
arr = [3, 1, 2, 2]
sorted_arr = func_1(arr)
```
Expected output is `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, but if we run the function, it may not guarantee that due to the way it handles finding the maximum index.

Additionally, an empty list `[]` or a single element list `[1]` are edge cases that may not behave as expected since the outer loop will not execute at all, returning the list unchanged, which is technically sorted but could be seen as unexpected behavior without explicit handling.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm due to issues with duplicates and potential errors with mixed types, leading to incorrect or unexpected results.

Correctness: **False**.
