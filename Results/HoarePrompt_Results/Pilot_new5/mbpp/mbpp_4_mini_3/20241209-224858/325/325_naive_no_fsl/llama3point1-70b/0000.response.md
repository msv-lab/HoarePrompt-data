Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for the following scenarios:

1. Months that should return `False` for having 30 days: The program only checks if the month is in the list `[4, 6, 9, 11]`, which is correct for those months, but does not handle months like 1 (January), 2 (February), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), 12 (December) which do not have 30 days.

2. The program does not check for invalid month inputs (e.g., 0, 13, or negative numbers). The problem description implies that the function should only accept month numbers from 1 to 12. The current implementation does not handle these cases.

As a result, the program is incorrect because it does not return the expected results for all valid and invalid inputs. For example, calling `func_1(1)` should return `False`, but the current implementation does not specify behavior for such cases.
