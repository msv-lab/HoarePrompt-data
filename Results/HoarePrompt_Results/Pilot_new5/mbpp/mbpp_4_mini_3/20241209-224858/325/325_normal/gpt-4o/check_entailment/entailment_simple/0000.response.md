Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem description, the function must check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) has 30 days. 

The annotated program defines a set `months_with_30_days` containing the months 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), and 11 (November). The function `func_1` checks if the input month is in this set, returning True if it is, which indicates that the month has 30 days.

However, this implementation is incorrect because:

1. The month of February (month 2) is not included in the set. In a non-leap year, February has 28 days, but the program needs to return False for it having 30 days, which it does correctly.
2. The months of January (month 1), March (month 3), May (month 5), July (month 7), August (month 8), October (month 10), and December (month 12) should all return False since they do not have 30 days (January, March, May, July, August, October have 31 days, and December has 31 days).

The function only accounts for months with 30 days, but it fails to correctly handle the months with either 31 days or less than 30 days. The assertions provided at the top do not sufficiently cover all possible cases, and testing only a few months does not guarantee that the function handles all numbers from 1 to 12 correctly. 

For example, the function would incorrectly return True for month 6 (June) and False for month 12 (December), which has 31 days.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
