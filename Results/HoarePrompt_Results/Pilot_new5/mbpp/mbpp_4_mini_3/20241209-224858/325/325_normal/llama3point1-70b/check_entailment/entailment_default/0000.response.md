The provided program defines a function `func_1` to determine if a given month (specified as an integer from 1 to 12) has 30 days. The function checks if the given month is either April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11), which are the only months that have 30 days.

Upon reviewing the problem description and the program:
1. The function correctly identifies the months that have 30 days, as specified in the problem description.
2. Months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and February (which has either 28 or 29 days) correctly return `False`.

Now, turning to the output hints:
- The hints accurately describe that the function accepts an integer `month` between 1 and 12 and checks for 30-day months (April, June, September, and November). 
- It also specifies that for all other months (including February), the function returns `False`, which aligns with the function's behavior.

### Edge Cases:
- The function does not explicitly handle input outside the expected range (1 to 12). However, the problem description does not require handling invalid input, so this is not necessarily an issue for correctness based on the given specification.
- If a user inputs an invalid month (like 0 or 13), the function would return `False` since those numbers are not in the `thirty_days_months` list. 

Given that the provided function meets the requirements of the problem description and behaves as described in the output hints, I do not identify any cases where the function fails to work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
