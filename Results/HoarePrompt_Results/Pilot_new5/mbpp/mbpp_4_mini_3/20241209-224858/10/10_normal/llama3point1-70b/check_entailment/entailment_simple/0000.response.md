Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the calculation of the volume of a triangular prism based on the problem description. It uses the formula for the volume of a prism, which is given by the area of the triangular base multiplied by the length of the prism.

In the function `func_1(b, h, l)`, the volume is calculated as follows:
1. The area of the triangular base is calculated using the formula: \( \text{Area} = \frac{b \times h}{2} \), where \( b \) is the base of the triangle and \( h \) is its height.
2. The volume of the prism is then obtained by multiplying the area of the triangular base by the length \( l \) of the prism: \( \text{Volume} = \text{Area} \times l \).

Thus, the program adheres to the mathematical definition of the volume of a triangular prism. Since it consistently calculates the volume correctly for all positive float inputs for \( b \), \( h \), and \( l \), it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.
