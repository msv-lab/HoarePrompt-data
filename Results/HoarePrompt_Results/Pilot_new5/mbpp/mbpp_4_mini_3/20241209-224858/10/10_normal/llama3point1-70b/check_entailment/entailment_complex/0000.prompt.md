You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive float representing the base of the triangular prism, h is a positive float representing the height of the triangle, and l is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as (base 'b' multiplied by height 'h' divided by 2) multiplied by length 'l'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive float parameters: `b` (the base of the triangular prism), `h` (the height of the triangle), and `l` (the length of the prism). It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula (base `b` multiplied by height `h` divided by 2, multiplied by length `l`). There are no validation checks for non-positive values, which could lead to incorrect volume calculations if negative or zero values are passed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
