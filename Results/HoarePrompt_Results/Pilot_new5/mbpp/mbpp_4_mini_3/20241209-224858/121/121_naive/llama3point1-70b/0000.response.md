Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_2` is intended to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, it does not correctly handle the case when `n` is less than 1. The function should ideally raise an error or handle such cases (like returning None or a specific value) since there is no 0th or negative nth prime number. As it stands, if someone inputs `n = 0` or a negative number, the function will enter an infinite loop and never return a value. 

For example:
- If `n = 0`, the function will start with `num = 7` and will never increment `count`, hence `count` will never equal `0`, causing an infinite loop. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
