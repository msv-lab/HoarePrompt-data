The value of `num` is incremented by 1, changing it from 8 to 9. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for returning values are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is increased to 2, `num` is 9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is increased to 2, `num` is 9**
