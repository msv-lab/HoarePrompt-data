To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the provided code and its impact on the variables involved, considering the initial values and the results from the first few iterations.

1. **Initial State**: We start with `S0` as 1 and `S1` as 1.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs for each `i` from 2 to `n`, updating `S0` and `S1` based on the formula `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`. 
3. **Values After Each Iteration**: 
   - **After 1st Iteration (i = 2)**: 
     - `S_next` becomes 3, updating `S0` to 1 and `S1` to 3.
   - **After 2nd Iteration (i = 3)**: 
     - `S_next` becomes 7, updating `S0` to 3 and `S1` to 7.
   - **After 3rd Iteration (i = 4)**: 
     - `S_next` becomes 17, updating `S0` to 7 and `S1` to 17.

4. **Final State After Loop Execution**: 
   - For a loop that continues executing until `i` reaches `n`, the final values of `S0` and `S1` will depend on the last calculated `S_next` before the loop terminates. 

To express the final output state, we note that after `n` iterations:
- At the end of the loop, `S0` will be the value of `S1` from the previous iteration, and `S1` will be the last computed `S_next` for `i = n`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is the value of `S1` from the last iteration, `S1` is the value of `S_next` at `i = n`.**
