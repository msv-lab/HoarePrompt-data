The variables `S0` and `S1` are both assigned the value of `1`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than `1`, but that does not affect the assignment of `S0` and `S1`. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1; `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1**
