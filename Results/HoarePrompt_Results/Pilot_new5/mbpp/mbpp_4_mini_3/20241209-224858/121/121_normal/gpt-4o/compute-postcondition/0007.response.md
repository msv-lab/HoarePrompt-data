According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the variable `i` is less than or equal to `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 2 and increments `i` by 1 each time it completes an iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, we know `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `i` must still be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 3**
