The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than 2 or if it is not a prime number. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is prime, it returns True. The function does not handle edge cases explicitly related to input types (e.g., negative integers or non-integer types), but it assumes `n` is a non-negative integer as stated in the precondition.
