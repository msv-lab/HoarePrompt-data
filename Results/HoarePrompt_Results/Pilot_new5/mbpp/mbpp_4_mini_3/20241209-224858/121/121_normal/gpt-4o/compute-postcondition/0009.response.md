In the provided code, the values of `S0` and `S1` are updated based on the current value of `S1` and `S_next`. Specifically, `S0` will take the value of the previous `S1`, which is 3, and `S1` will take the value of `S_next`, which is 7. 

Thus, after executing the code, the updated variable states are:
- `S0` becomes 3
- `S1` becomes 7

The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `S_next`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
