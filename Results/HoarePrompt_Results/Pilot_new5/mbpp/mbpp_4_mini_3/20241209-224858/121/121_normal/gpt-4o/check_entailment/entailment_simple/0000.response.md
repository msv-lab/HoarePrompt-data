The provided Python program is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, the implementation does not correctly compute these prime numbers according to the established sequence. 

The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers, and they can be defined using a recurrence relation. The first few Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, and so forth. The implementation in `func_1` computes numbers using a specific recurrence relation but does not check for primality or generate the correct sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. The function correctly handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, returning 1. However, this is not consistent with the sequence of primes, which should begin with the first prime number (2).
2. For values of `n > 1`, the loop attempts to create a series, but it does not correspond to the definition of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. It simply computes a sequence of integers based on the recurrence relation without ensuring they are prime or corresponding to the actual primes in the sequence.
3. The program does not validate whether the numbers generated are prime, which is essential for determining if they belong to the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

### Conclusion:
Since the implementation does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description and fails to correctly identify the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
