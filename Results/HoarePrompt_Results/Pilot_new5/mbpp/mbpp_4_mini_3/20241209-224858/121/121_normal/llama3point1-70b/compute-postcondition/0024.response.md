The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `count` was 2, after the execution, `count` will be 3. The values of `n` and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 3, `num` is 9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 3, `num` is 9**.
