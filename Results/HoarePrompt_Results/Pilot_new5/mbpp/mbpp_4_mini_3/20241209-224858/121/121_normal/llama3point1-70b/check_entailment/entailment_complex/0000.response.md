Correctness: **False**

The code claims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but it has some issues that lead to incorrect behavior:

1. **Handling of Input Types**: The function `func_2` states that `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, yet it does not explicitly check for non-integer inputs. This could lead to an infinite loop if a non-integer or a negative value is inadvertently passed as an argument, violating the function's intended behavior as described in the problem statement.

2. **Potential Infinite Loop**: If `n` is not a positive integer greater than 0, the program could enter an infinite loop within the `while True` statement in `func_2`. For instance, if `n` were set to 0 or a negative number, the program would never return a valid output, which contradicts the problem description that states it should find the nth prime number.

3. **Edge Case of `n == 1`**: While it correctly returns 7 for `n = 1`, any input below or equal to 0 does not have proper handling that aligns with the requirement of the function to find the nth prime.

Given these observations, the implementation does not guarantee correct behavior for all potential inputs as described in the problem statement. Thus, the correctness of the program is compromised.
