The variable `count` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, but the value of `count` is now explicitly set to `1`. No other variables are affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 1**
