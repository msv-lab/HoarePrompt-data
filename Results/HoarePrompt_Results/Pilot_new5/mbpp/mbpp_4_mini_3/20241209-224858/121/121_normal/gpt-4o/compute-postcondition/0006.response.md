The code assigns the value of `S1` to `S0` and the value of `S_next` to `S1`. The previous value of `S1` is 1, and `S_next` is 3. Therefore, after the execution of the code:

- `S0` will take the value of `S1`, which is 1.
- `S1` will take the value of `S_next`, which is 3.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `S_next`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**.
