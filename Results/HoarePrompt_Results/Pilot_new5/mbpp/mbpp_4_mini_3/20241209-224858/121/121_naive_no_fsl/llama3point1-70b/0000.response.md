To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

### Implementation Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function checks if a number `n` is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and correctly implements the trial division method for checking primality.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
   - It starts with `num` set to 7, as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is 7.
   - It uses a while loop to check each number for primality and whether it is of the form `6k ± 1` (i.e., `num % 6 in [1, 5]`).
   - It counts the valid prime numbers until it reaches the nth one.

### Requirements for Newman-Shanks-Williams Primes:
Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are a specific subset of prime numbers, and they can be found using the formula that involves Mersenne primes or other specific criteria.

### Potential Issue:
- The code currently only checks for numbers that are prime and of the form `6k ± 1`, but it fails to specifically identify if those primes are indeed Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The known list of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes includes specific numbers, and simply checking for primes of the form `6k ± 1` does not guarantee that they are Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.
- For example, the program may incorrectly include a prime like `11`, which is `6k + 5` but is not a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. 

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly identify the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, as it is too broad and includes other primes not in the required set, it fails for specific inputs that are meant to return true Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

Correctness: **False**
