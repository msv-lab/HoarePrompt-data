The function accepts a string `s` and a character `char`. It returns a new string based on the occurrences of `char`: if `char` appears exactly once in `s`, it removes that occurrence; if `char` appears multiple times, it removes both the first and the last occurrences; if `char` does not exist in `s`, it returns the original string unchanged.
