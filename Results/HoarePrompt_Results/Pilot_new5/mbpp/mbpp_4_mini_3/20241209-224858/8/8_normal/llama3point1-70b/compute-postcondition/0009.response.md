The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `char`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `char` is a single character. 

- In Case_1, if the single occurrence of `char` is found in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with that occurrence of `char` removed.
- In Case_2, if the first and last occurrences of `char` are present in `s`, the function returns a new string formed by removing both the character at `first_occurrence` and the character at `last_occurrence`, while keeping the rest of the string intact.
- In Case_3, if neither of the above cases are fulfilled, the function returns the string `s` unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `char`, and based on the occurrences of `char` in `s`, it returns a modified version of `s` or the original string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`, and returns a modified string based on the occurrences of `char`: removing one occurrence, removing first and last occurrences, or returning the original string.**
