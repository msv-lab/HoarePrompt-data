`first_occurrence` is assigned the value of `s.find(char)`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is not found in `s`, `first_occurrence` will be `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the Output State is: `s` is a string, `char` is a single character, and `first_occurrence` is either the index of `char` in `s` or `-1` if `char` is not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is either the index of `char` in `s` or `-1` if `char` is not found.**
