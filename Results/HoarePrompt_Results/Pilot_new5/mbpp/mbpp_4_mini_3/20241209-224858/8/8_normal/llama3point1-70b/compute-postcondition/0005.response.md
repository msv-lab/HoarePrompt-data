Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is either the index of `char` in `s` or `-1`, `last_occurrence` is either the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` or `-1`. The current values are such that `first_occurrence` is not -1 and `last_occurrence` is not -1, and `first_occurrence` is not equal to `last_occurrence`.***
