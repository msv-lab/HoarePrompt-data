Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the area of a rectangle. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `length` and `width`. It calculates the area by returning the product of these two parameters (`length * width`). 

The assertions provided in the program serve as tests to validate the correctness of the function for specific inputs. Each assertion checks that the output of `func_1` is equal to the expected area for given length and width values:

1. `func_1(10, 20)` should return `200`, which is the correct area for a rectangle with length `10` and width `20`.
2. `func_1(10, 5)` should return `50`, the correct area for length `10` and width `5`.
3. `func_1(4, 2)` should return `8`, the correct area for length `4` and width `2`.

Since the function performs the calculation as specified and passes the provided tests, it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function is also designed to accept non-negative integers or floats, which aligns with the expected input types for length and width.

Overall, the program accurately fulfills the problem's requirements at all tested cases, confirming its correctness.
