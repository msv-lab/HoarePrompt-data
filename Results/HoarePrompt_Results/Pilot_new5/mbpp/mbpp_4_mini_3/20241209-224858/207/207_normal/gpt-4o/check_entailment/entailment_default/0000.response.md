The code provided defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its `length` and `width`. The problem description specifies that the function should work with non-negative integers or floats, and the provided assertions are examples that show the function working correctly for those values.

However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle potential edge cases where either parameter is negative. This is a significant issue because the problem description implies that the function should only accept non-negative values. If a negative value is passed, the function would still execute and return a negative area, which is not valid.

To clarify:

1. The code correctly computes the area for the given test cases where both `length` and `width` are non-negative.
2. The output hints acknowledge that the function does not handle negative values, which contradicts the problem description's implication that it should only work with non-negative values.

Given this analysis, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case since it does not account for negative inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function does not handle cases where either `length` or `width` is negative. For example, if `func_1(-10, 5)` is called, it returns -50, which is incorrect as the area of a rectangle cannot be negative.
