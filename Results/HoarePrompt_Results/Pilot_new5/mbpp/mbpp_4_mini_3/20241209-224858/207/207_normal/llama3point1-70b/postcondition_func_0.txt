The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are non-negative integers or floats. It calculates and returns the area of a rectangle by multiplying `length` and `width`. The function does not handle cases where `length` or `width` are negative, nor does it validate their types beyond allowing integers and floats.
