Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, which represent the dimensions of a rectangle. The function calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying these two parameters together.

The key points that demonstrate the correctness are:

1. **Functionality**: The function performs the multiplication of `length` and `width`, which is the correct mathematical operation to compute the area of a rectangle.
  
2. **Input Types**: The problem description mentions that `length` and `width` can be non-negative integers or floats. The program does not impose restrictions or checks on the input types, but it correctly handles multiplication for both integers and floats in Python. As long as the inputs are non-negative (as stated in the annotations), the function will return a valid area.

3. **Output**: The output of the function is the calculated area, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to find the area of a rectangle.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential valid inputs, thus it is correct.
