#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]:
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer, `undulating` is True if all required conditions were met, otherwise `undulating` is False.
    return undulating
    #The program returns True if all required conditions were met, otherwise it returns False based on the value of 'undulating'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the digits of `n` create an undulating pattern (alternating between increasing and decreasing). It returns True if the digits are undulating, otherwise, it returns False. If `n` has fewer than three digits, the undulating condition cannot be evaluated, and the function will return True since the loop is never entered.
