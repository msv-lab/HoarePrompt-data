Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `i` is 1, `undulating` is True. The character at index `i` in `n` is not part of a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence with its neighboring characters (i.e., either `n[i - 1] >= n[i]` or `n[i] <= n[i + 1]`)***
