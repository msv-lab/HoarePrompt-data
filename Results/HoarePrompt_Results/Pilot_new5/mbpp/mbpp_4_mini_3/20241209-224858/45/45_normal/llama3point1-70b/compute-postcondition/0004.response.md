The `pass` statement does not modify any variables or state. It serves as a placeholder and does not affect the flow of execution or the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that we've executed a `pass` statement.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `i` is 1, `undulating` is True. The current character `n[0]` is less than `n[1]` and `n[1]` is less than `n[2]`, or `n[0]` is greater than `n[1]` and `n[1]` is greater than `n[2].`**
