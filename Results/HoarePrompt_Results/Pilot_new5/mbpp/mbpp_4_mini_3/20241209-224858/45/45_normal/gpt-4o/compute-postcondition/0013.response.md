Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` that must have at least 3 characters, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `i` is 2, `i` is even, and the character at index 2 of `s` is equal to `first_digit`. The variable `i` is currently 2, which is even. The condition `(i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit)` is true, indicating that `i` cannot be odd, therefore this part of the condition is irrelevant, and `s[2]` must not be equal to `second_digit`.***
