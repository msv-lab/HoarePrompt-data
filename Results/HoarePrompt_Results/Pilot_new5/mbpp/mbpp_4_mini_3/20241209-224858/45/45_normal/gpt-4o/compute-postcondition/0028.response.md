The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, if the length of the string representation of `n` is less than 3, the function returns False (Case 1). If the first digit is equal to the second digit, the function returns False (Case 2). If the character at index 2 of the string representation is not equal to the first digit, the function returns False (Case 3). In addition, there are multiple cases where the function may return False (Cases 4 to 8). Finally, if none of the conditions for returning False are met, the function returns True, indicating that the conditions based on the string representation of `n` and its digit pattern are satisfied (Case 9). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return a boolean value based on specific conditions related to its string representation and digit patterns.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer, and returns False under various conditions related to the digit pattern of n; if none of the conditions for returning False are met, it returns True.**
