The variable `second_digit` is assigned the value of `s[1]`, which corresponds to the second character in the string representation of the positive integer `n`. Since `s` is the string representation of `n`, `s[1]` will yield the second digit of `n`, if it exists. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `first_digit` is the string character representing the first digit of `n`, and `second_digit` is the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `first_digit` is the string character representing the first digit of `n`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`.**
