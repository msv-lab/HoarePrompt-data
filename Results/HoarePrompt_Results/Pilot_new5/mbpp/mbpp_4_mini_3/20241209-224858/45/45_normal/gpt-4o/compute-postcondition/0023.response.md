Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with at least 4 characters, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `i` is 4. If `i` is even and the character at position `i` of `s` is not equal to `first_digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.***
