Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with at least 4 characters, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `i` is 3, which is odd. If `i` is even and the character at index 2 of `s` is not equal to `first_digit`, the function returns False. In all other cases, the function does not return any value.***
