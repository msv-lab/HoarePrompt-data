To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the implementation against the problem description: "Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not."

An undulating number is defined based on the following criteria:
1. The number must have at least three digits.
2. The digits must alternate between two distinct digits.

Now let's review the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True
```

### Review of the Function:
1. The function converts the number to a string to analyze its digits.
2. It checks if the length of the string (number of digits) is less than 3.
3. It assigns the first two digits to `first_digit` and `second_digit`.
4. It checks if the first two digits are the same, returning `False` if they are.
5. It then iterates through the rest of the digits, ensuring they alternate between `first_digit` and `second_digit`.

### Potential Issues:
- The function correctly handles cases with less than 3 digits by returning `False`.
- The function checks if the first two digits are different, which is necessary for an undulating number.
- The loop that checks for alternating digits appears correct.

### However:
- The function does not handle negative numbers or numbers with leading zeros, which may or may not be considered based on the context of "number". If we consider `-1212121` or `012` as inputs, the function would treat them as valid undulating numbers, but logically they might not be considered as such based on typical definitions.
- Additionally, the function lacks a case for numbers that consist of more than two distinct digits, which are not undulating numbers.

### Test Cases Not Covered:
- For instance, if you pass `123`, the function would return `False`, but it correctly identifies it as non-undulating.
- A number like `121212` would return `True`, which is correct.
- However, `123123` should return `False` but the implementation does not explicitly check for more than two distinct digits.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly identifies most undulating numbers but fails to account for potential edge cases involving more than two distinct digits, as well as negative numbers or leading zeros if those were to be considered.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not account for numbers with more than two alternating digits, which is a requirement for undulating numbers. For example, if you input `123123`, which has three distinct digits, it should return `False`, but could potentially be misinterpreted as undulating with the current implementation.
