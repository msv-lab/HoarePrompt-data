To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze it against the problem description of checking whether a number is undulating or not.

### Understanding "Undulating":
An undulating number alternates between two different digits. Based on the examples and logic in the code, the following conditions must hold true for a number to be undulating:
1. The number must have at least 3 digits.
2. The first digit must be different from the second digit.
3. Even indexed positions (0-based) must contain the first digit, and odd indexed positions must contain the second digit.

### Reviewing the Program:
The provided function `func_1` implements the following logic:
- It first checks if the length of the number (as a string) is less than 3, returning `False` if it is.
- It then compares the first two digits. If they are the same, it returns `False`.
- It uses a loop to check each digit based on its index (even or odd) to ensure they match the expected alternating pattern.

### Test Cases:
The assertions given in the program are:
1. `func_1(1212121) == True` - This number is undulating (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1).
2. `func_1(1991) == False` - This number is not undulating (1 and 9 are not alternating properly).
3. `func_1(121) == True` - This number is undulating (1, 2, 1).

### Edge Cases:
To find any potential failures, we can consider additional test cases:
- A number that is too short, e.g., `12`. The function should return `False`, which it does.
- A number with the same digits, e.g., `111`, should return `False`, which it does.
- A longer undulating number with three digits, e.g., `212`, should return `True`, which is correctly handled.
- A number that alternates but starts with the same digits, e.g., `121212`, should return `True`, which is correctly handled.

However, let's consider:
- Input like `123123`. This should also return `False` since it doesn't alternate only between two digits, but the current implementation would incorrectly return `True`, as it expects just two alternating digits.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, for instance, it would incorrectly accept a number like `123123` as undulating, this indicates it does not satisfy the problem description for every potential input.

Thus, considering this failure to handle at least one case correctly:

Correctness: **False**
