#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value that can be of any type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all items in the list 'lst' are equal to the value of 'element', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It returns True if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`; if `lst` is empty, it also returns True (since all zero items can be considered equal to `element`), and returns False if at least one item in `lst` is not equal to `element.
