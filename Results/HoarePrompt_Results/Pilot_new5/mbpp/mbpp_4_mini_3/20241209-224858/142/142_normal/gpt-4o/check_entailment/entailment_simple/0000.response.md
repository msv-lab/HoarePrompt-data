To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and the behavior described in the problem.

**Problem Description:**
The function must check whether all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. 

**Analyzing the Program:**
1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `element`, which is the value to compare against.
2. The function iterates through each `item` in `lst`.
3. If any `item` in `lst` is not equal to `element`, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any unequal items, the function returns `True`, indicating that all items in `lst` are equal to `element`.

**Key Points:**
- If `lst` is an empty list, the for loop does not execute, and the function directly returns `True`. This behavior is consistent with the interpretation that all items (which are none in this case) are equal to the `element`.
- The assertions provided in the program check various cases:
  - The first assertion checks that a list with different colors returns `False` when comparing to 'blue', which is correct.
  - The second assertion checks that a list of numbers returns `False` when comparing to a value that is not present, which is also correct.
  - The third assertion checks that a list of identical colors returns `True` when compared to 'green', which is correct.

**Conclusion:**
The function correctly determines if all items in the list are equal to the given element, handling all specified cases, including an empty list. 

Therefore, following the analysis:

Correctness: **True**
