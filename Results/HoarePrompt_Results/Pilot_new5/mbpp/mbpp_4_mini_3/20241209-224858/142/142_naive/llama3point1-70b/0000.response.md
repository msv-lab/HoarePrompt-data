Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly takes in a list and an element, and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The use of the `all()` function in combination with a generator expression efficiently checks each item in the list against the element. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. If the list is empty (`lst = []`), `all()` will return `True`, which is correct since there are no items to contradict the condition of being equal to the element.
2. If the list contains items that are equal to the element, `all()` will return `True`.
3. If at least one item in the list is not equal to the element, `all()` will correctly return `False`.

The function handles all potential cases as described, so it is correct.
