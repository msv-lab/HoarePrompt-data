Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to convert degrees to radians. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Specifications**: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `deg`, which is stated to be a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Conversion Formula**: The program implements the correct mathematical formula to convert degrees to radians: `deg * math.pi / 180`. This formula accurately converts degrees to radians, adhering strictly to the definition of angular measurements.

3. **Function Output**: The function returns the result of the conversion, which is the expected behavior based on the problem description.

4. **Assumption Handling**: While the function does not handle non-numeric input or provide error checking, the problem description does not specify any requirements for input validation, so this assumption does not violate the requirements.

Overall, the function correctly performs the task of converting degrees to radians as specified in the problem description, hence it is deemed correct.
