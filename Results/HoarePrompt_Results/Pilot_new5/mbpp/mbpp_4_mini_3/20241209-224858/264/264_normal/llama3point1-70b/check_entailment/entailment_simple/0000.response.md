Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians as specified in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(deg)` takes a single argument `deg`, which is intended to be a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.

2. **Conversion Formula**: Inside the function, it uses the formula `deg * math.pi / 180` to convert degrees to radians. This formula is mathematically accurate. To elaborate:
   - The value of π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.
   - To convert degrees to radians, you multiply the degree value by π and then divide by 180, which is the correct approach.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the result of the conversion, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to convert angles from degrees to radians.

The program does not exhibit any issues or edge cases that would cause it to fail the problem description. It handles all numeric inputs effectively, including positive degrees, negative degrees, and zero, as they all yield valid radian outputs.

In summary, since the function correctly implements the degrees-to-radians conversion and follows the problem description appropriately, the correctness is confirmed as **True**.
