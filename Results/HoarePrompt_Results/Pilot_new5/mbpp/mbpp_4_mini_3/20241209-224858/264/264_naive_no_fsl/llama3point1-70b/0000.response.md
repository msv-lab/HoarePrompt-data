Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is mathematically accurate for all valid inputs of degrees. 

Moreover, the function does not have any restrictions on the input type, and Python naturally handles both integer and float inputs, returning the correct radian value for any number of degrees, including negative and zero values. 

Since I could not identify any potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct in all cases.
