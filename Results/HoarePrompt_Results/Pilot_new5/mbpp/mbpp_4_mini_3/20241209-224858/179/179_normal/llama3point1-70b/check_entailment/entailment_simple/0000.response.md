Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which asks for the computation of the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

Here's the breakdown of why the implementation is correct:

1. **Understanding Even Natural Numbers**: The first `n` even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to `2n`. 

2. **Range Generation**: The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates the sequence of even numbers starting from 2 up to `2n` (inclusive). The parameters of the `range` function:
   - Start at 2 (the first even number).
   - End at `n * 2 + 1`, which ensures that `2n` is included in the generated series.
   - Step of 2 ensures only even numbers are selected.

3. **Cubing and Summing**: The expression `i ** 3` cubes each of these even numbers, and `sum(...)` computes the total sum of these cubes. This adheres to the requirement to find the cube sum.

4. **Correctness Across Edge Cases**:
   - If `n = 0`, the range produces no numbers, and the sum is correctly `0`, matching the expected outcome of having no even numbers.
   - If `n = 1`, the sum of the cubes of the first even number (2) is `2^3 = 8`, which is also correct.
   - The function will handle any non-negative integer input for `n` correctly, producing the expected outputs in all cases.

Therefore, the program accurately fulfills the problem description as it effectively calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.
