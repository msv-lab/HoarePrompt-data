Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem Description**: The task is to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The first `n` even natural numbers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., up to `2n`.

2. **Analysis of the Annotated Program**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
   - It computes the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to `2n` using a generator expression within the `sum()` function.
   - The range used in the generator expression is `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`, which correctly generates the even integers starting from 2 up to `2n`, inclusive. This ensures that all the first `n` even natural numbers are considered.

3. **Correctness for Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0, the range becomes `range(2, 1, 2)`, which results in an empty range. Thus, the sum is 0, which is correct since there are no even natural numbers to sum.
   - For values of `n` greater than 0, the program captures the cubes of all even numbers correctly and sums them.

In conclusion, the program fulfills the requirement of calculating the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers accurately, and thus it is correct.
