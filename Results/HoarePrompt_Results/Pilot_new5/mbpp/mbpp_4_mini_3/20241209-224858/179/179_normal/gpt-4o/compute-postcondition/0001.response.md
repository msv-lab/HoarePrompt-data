The variable `even_numbers` is a list containing even numbers from `2` to `2 * n`. The code computes `cube_sum` as the sum of the cubes of each element in `even_numbers`. If `n = 0`, then `even_numbers` is an empty list, and therefore `cube_sum` will be `0`. 

If `n` is greater than `0`, `even_numbers` will contain the numbers `2, 4, 6, ..., 2 * n`, and `cube_sum` will be the sum of the cubes of these numbers. The value of `even_numbers` will change based on the value of `n`.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect this:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `even_numbers` is a list of even numbers from `2` to `2 * n`; `cube_sum` is the sum of cubes of elements in `even_numbers`.**
