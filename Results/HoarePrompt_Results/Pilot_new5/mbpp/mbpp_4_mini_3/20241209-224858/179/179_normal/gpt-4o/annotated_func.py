#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns the sum of cubes of elements in the list 'even_numbers', which contains even numbers from 2 to 2 * n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of all even numbers from 2 to 2 * n. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0 since there are no even numbers to consider.
