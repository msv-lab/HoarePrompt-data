To analyze the provided Python function and determine its correctness based on the problem description and output hints, we proceed as follows:

**Problem Description:** The function should calculate the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

**Initial Assessment of the Code:**
1. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2` (inclusive).
2. It calculates the cube of each even number and sums these cubes.
3. For `n = 0`, the range would be `range(2, 1, 2)`, which results in an empty range, thus `sum()` will return 0 as expected.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- `n = 0` should return 0, which the code handles properly.
- `n = 1` should return \(2^3 = 8\).
- `n = 2` should return \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
- `n = 3` should return \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).

These cases seem to work under the initial inspection, so it appears the code is correct for these inputs.

**Output Hints Validation:**
The output hints state that the function:
- Accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
- Returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to `n * 2`, inclusive.
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.

The hints align with the function's behavior; there is no discrepancy. Each aspect mentioned in the hints is validated by the code's logic.

**Conclusion:**
Since the function correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers for all examined cases and the output hints agree with the function's implementation, we conclude that the code meets the requirements of the problem description without exceptions.

Correctness: **True**.
