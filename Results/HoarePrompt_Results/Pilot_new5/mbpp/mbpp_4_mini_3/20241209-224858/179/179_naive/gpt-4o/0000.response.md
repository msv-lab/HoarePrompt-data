To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided Python code step by step.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.

**Given Program:**
```python
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))
    return cube_sum
```

**Analysis:**

1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents how many even natural numbers to consider.
2. It generates the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This produces the sequence: 
   - For `n = 2`: [2, 4]
   - For `n = 3`: [2, 4, 6]
   - For `n = 4`: [2, 4, 6, 8]
3. It then calculates the cube of each of these numbers and sums them up using `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`.

Now let's compute the expected results:

- For `n = 2`: 
  - Even numbers: [2, 4]
  - Cube sum: \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\) (correctly matches assertion).

- For `n = 3`: 
  - Even numbers: [2, 4, 6]
  - Cube sum: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\) (correctly matches assertion).

- For `n = 4`: 
  - Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8]
  - Cube sum: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\) (correctly matches assertion).

**Testing Edge Cases:**
Let's consider some additional test cases:

- For `n = 0`: 
  - The expected output should be 0 since there are no even numbers to sum cubes of.
  
- For `n = 1`: 
  - Even numbers: [2]
  - Cube sum: \(2^3 = 8\)

The current implementation does not handle the case when `n = 0`. It will still compute the list as empty, leading to a cube sum of 0, which is correct. However, when `n = 1` it will return 8, which is also correct. 

Thus, the function appears to handle these cases correctly.

Given that the program produces the correct output for the provided assertions and additional edge cases checked, the function appears to be implemented correctly.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers based on the provided problem description and matches the assertions given.
