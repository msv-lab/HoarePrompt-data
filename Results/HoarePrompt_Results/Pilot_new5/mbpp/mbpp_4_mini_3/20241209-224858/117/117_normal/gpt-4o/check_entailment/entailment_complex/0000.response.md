Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the problem description, which requires a function to return the number of integer elements in a given list. 

1. The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list `lst` as input, which may contain various data types including integers.
2. It utilizes a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate through each element `x` in the list `lst`.
3. The expression `isinstance(x, int)` checks if `x` is an instance of the integer type. If it is, it adds 1 to the count.
4. The final result is the total count of integers in the list, which is returned by the function.

The function will return 0 if there are no integers in the list, which is consistent with the requirement to count the number of integer elements. It correctly handles all potential cases, including empty lists and lists containing only non-integer types. 

The assertions provided in the program validate that it works as intended for a variety of input scenarios, confirming that the implementation meets the problem requirements. Thus, the program is correct.
