Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Type**: The function accepts a single argument `lst`, which is expected to be a list containing elements of various types, including integers.

2. **Counting Integers**: The core logic of the function uses a generator expression with `sum()` that iterates over each element `x` in `lst` and checks if `x` is an instance of `int`. The expression `isinstance(x, int)` returns `True` for integer elements and `False` for non-integer elements. The `sum()` function effectively counts the number of `True` values returned, which directly corresponds to the number of integer elements in the list.

3. **No Additional Logic**: The function does not perform any additional operations or modifications to the list; it solely focuses on counting the integers, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

Since the function accurately counts and returns the number of integer elements in the given list, it meets the problem requirements without any exceptions or omissions.
