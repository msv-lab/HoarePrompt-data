Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which states that the function must return the number of integer elements in a given list. 

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list that may contain various types of elements, including integers.
2. Inside the function, the expression `isinstance(x, int)` checks whether each element `x` in the list is an instance of the `int` type.
3. The generator expression `sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` iterates over each element in `lst`, returning `True` (which is treated as `1` in the sum) for integers and `False` (treated as `0`) for non-integer elements.
4. The `sum` function then totals these values, effectively counting the number of integers in the list.

Given that the program correctly counts and returns the number of integer elements, it satisfies the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
