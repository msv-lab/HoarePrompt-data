To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to ensure that the function meets the problem description of getting the angle of a complex number for all possible edge cases and inputs.

The function `func_1(real, imag)` converts the provided real and imaginary parts into a complex number and returns its angle using `cmath.phase()`. The angle returned is in radians, which is consistent with the problem description for getting the angle of a complex number.

Now, let's analyze the provided assertions in the code:

1. `func_1(0, 1j)` should return the angle of the complex number `0 + 1j`, which is π/2 or approximately 1.5707963267948966.
2. `func_1(2, 1j)` should return the angle for the complex number `2 + 1j`, which is approximately 0.4636476090008061.
3. `func_1(0, 2j)` should return the angle of the complex number `0 + 2j`, which is again π/2 or 1.5707963267948966.

These assertions are correctly checking the expected outputs.

Next, we need to consider edge cases:

1. If both the real and imaginary parts are zero (0 + 0j), the angle is undefined.
2. The angle for complex numbers in different quadrants (e.g., negative imaginary parts) should also be correctly handled.

Let's check the edge case where both parts are zero:
- `func_1(0, 0)` would yield `cmath.phase(0 + 0j)`, which is technically defined to return 0, but mathematically, the angle of zero magnitude is considered undefined.

Since the program does not handle the case of a zero complex number, this represents a failure in the implementation according to the problem description. Thus, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
