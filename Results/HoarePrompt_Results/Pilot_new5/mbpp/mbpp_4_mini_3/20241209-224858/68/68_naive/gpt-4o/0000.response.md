Correctness: **False**.

The provided program `func_1` is intended to calculate the angle (or phase) of a complex number. However, it does not handle the case where both the real and imaginary parts are zero. 

In Python, the `cmath.phase` function returns `0.0` for `complex(0, 0)`, but the program does not include an assertion to check this case. Thus, if we call `func_1(0, 0)`, it will return `0.0`, but there is no assertion in the provided code to confirm that this output is correct according to the problem description. 

This indicates that for at least one input (the zero complex number), the program does not explicitly check if the output matches the expected behavior, which can lead to ambiguity in correctness. Therefore, since the program does not ensure correctness for all potential cases, it is deemed incorrect.
