The provided program aims to compute the angle (phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The implementation uses the `cmath.phase` function, which is indeed the correct approach for determining the phase of a complex number.

1. **Initial Assessment**: The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which are supposed to be the real and imaginary components of a complex number. The usage of `complex(real, imag)` correctly creates a complex number, and `cmath.phase(complex_num)` computes the angle. The function appears to work as intended for valid floating-point inputs.

2. **Edge Cases**: However, there are potential edge cases that the function does not handle:
   - If `real` or `imag` is not a numeric type (e.g., a string or a list), a `TypeError` will be raised. The problem description does not state that the function should only accept numeric inputs, which makes it less robust.
   - Furthermore, the function lacks input validation. It doesn't account for cases such as `None` or other inappropriate types that could lead to runtime errors.

3. **Output Hints**: The output hints confirm the function's intended behavior by stating that it accepts two floating-point parameters and returns the phase of the complex number. However, they also correctly note that the function does not handle non-numeric types, which could lead to exceptions.

Given that the program fails to handle cases where the input parameters are non-numeric types, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not adequately handle non-numeric inputs, which is a crucial oversight in its implementation, meaning it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
