Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to compute the angle (or phase) of a complex number. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. According to the problem description, these parameters can be integers or floats, and the function handles these types correctly.

2. **Creating a Complex Number**: Inside the function, a complex number is constructed using the built-in `complex(real, imag)` function. This is in line with the requirement to work with complex numbers.

3. **Calculating the Angle**: The function returns `cmath.phase(complex_number)`, which accurately computes the phase (angle) of the complex number in radians. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

4. **Assertions for Testing**: The assertions provided test the functionality of the `func_1` function with different complex numbers, verifying that it returns the expected angle values within a small tolerance (0.001). This shows that the function works correctly for the provided test cases.

5. **General Case Handling**: Since the function constructs the complex number from any real and imaginary values (as long as they are numbers), it is capable of handling all potential cases that fall within the defined input types.

In summary, the program meets all criteria outlined in the problem description: it receives two numbers, converts them to a complex number, and returns the correct angle. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
