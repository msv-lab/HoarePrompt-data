`complex_num` is assigned the value of the complex number created from `real` and `imag`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, and `complex_num` is a complex number represented as `real + imag * 1j`.

Output State: **`real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_num` is a complex number represented as `real + imag * 1j`**.
