#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase of the complex number represented by `real + imag * 1j`, which is calculated using the cmath.phase function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two floating-point parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It returns the phase (or angle) of the complex number computed as `real + imag * 1j`, using the `cmath.phase` function. The function does not handle cases where the input parameters are non-numeric types, as this could raise a `TypeError` during execution.
