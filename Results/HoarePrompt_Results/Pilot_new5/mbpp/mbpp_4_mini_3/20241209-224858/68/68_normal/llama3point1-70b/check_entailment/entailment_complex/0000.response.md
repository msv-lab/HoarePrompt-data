Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two floating-point parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It constructs a complex number using these parameters and then calculates and returns its phase (or angle) using the `cmath.phase` function.

The phase of a complex number is indeed the angle it makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane, which is exactly what is asked for in the problem description. 

The function handles any valid floating-point inputs correctly, as it computes the angle for all complex numbers formed by these inputs. However, it is noted that the function does not handle non-numeric types, which might raise a `TypeError`. Nevertheless, this does not contradict the problem description, which does not specify the need for handling non-numeric inputs. Therefore, based on the requirements given, the implementation is correct.

In conclusion, the function fulfills the problem description as it effectively computes the angle of the complex number formed by the given real and imaginary parts.
