Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to get the angle of a complex number. Here's the breakdown of its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(real, imag)` takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. This aligns with the typical representation of complex numbers.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: Inside the function, `complex_number = complex(real, imag)` constructs a complex number using the provided real and imaginary parts. This is the standard way to create a complex number in Python.

3. **Calculating the Phase**: The line `return cmath.phase(complex_number)` computes the angle (or phase) of the complex number. The `cmath.phase()` function is specifically designed to return the phase angle of a complex number in radians, which is precisely what the problem description requires.

4. **Assertions for Testing**: The assertions provided in the program test the function against known values of complex numbers and their corresponding angles. Each assertion checks if the output of `func_1` is approximately equal to the expected angle using `math.isclose()` to account for floating-point precision issues.

Given that the program correctly implements the angle calculation of complex numbers as required by the problem description and passes all assertions, it is correct.
