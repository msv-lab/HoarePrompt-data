Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case when the input array is empty. According to the problem description, if the array is empty and we search for any number, the function should return -1, which is correct. However, the current implementation does not explicitly check for an empty array and would still return -1 in that case. This part is correct, but the main issue arises because the function does not properly handle the scenario for sorted arrays.

The program attempts to find the first occurrence of `num` by iterating through the entire array. While this works for finding the element in a general array, it is not efficient for a sorted array (since a binary search approach should be used). 

A potential edge case could be when there are multiple occurrences of `num` in the sorted array. For example:
- Input: `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, `num = 2`
- Expected output: `1` (index of the first occurrence)
- The current code correctly returns `1`, but if we had a large sorted array with many duplicates, the performance would be poor.

Furthermore, in the case of having duplicates, a binary search approach would be more appropriate to ensure that we find the first occurrence efficiently. Since the program does not implement a binary search, it may not be correct or optimal for all cases.

Thus, while it does return the correct result for small test cases, it lacks the optimized logic expected for searching in a sorted array, which leads to the conclusion that it is not fully correct as per the problem description.
