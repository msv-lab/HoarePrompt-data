The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, which calculates the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The preconditions specify that `arr` must not be empty and that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. The state of `arr` remains unchanged, and `low` and `high` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the calculation of `mid`.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty; `low` must be less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
