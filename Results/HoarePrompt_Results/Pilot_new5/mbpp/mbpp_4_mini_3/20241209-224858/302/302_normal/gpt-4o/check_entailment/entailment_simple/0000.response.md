Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The function `func_1` employs a binary search strategy, which is appropriate for sorted arrays. It initializes pointers `low` and `high` to the start and end of the array, respectively.

2. **Finding the Target**: The algorithm checks the middle element of the current search range:
   - If the middle element equals the target, it records the index in `result` and continues searching in the left half of the array (to ensure it's the first occurrence) by adjusting `high`.
   - If the middle element is less than the target, it narrows the search to the right half by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, it narrows the search to the left half by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.

3. **End Condition**: The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, meaning the search space has been exhausted. At this point, if the target was found, `result` holds the index of the first occurrence; if not, it remains as -1.

4. **Returns the Correct Value**: The function returns `result`, which correctly indicates the index of the first occurrence of the target or -1 if not found.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided test various scenarios, ensuring the function behaves correctly when the target is present multiple times, when it appears at different positions, and when it is absent.

Thus, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
