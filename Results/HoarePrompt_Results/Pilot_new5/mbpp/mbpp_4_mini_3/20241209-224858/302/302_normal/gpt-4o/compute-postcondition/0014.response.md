According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `arr` must not be empty, which implies there are still elements to consider. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to confirm that the condition `low <= high` holds true. If `low` is equal to `high`, the loop can still execute, and if `low` is less than `high`, it can definitely execute again. 

Since the state indicates that `arr[mid]` was compared with `target` and either `low` was updated to `mid + 1` or `high` was updated to `mid - 1`, we need to consider how these adjustments affect the bounds of `low` and `high`. 

1. If `high` was updated to `mid - 1`, then for the loop to execute again, `low` should not have surpassed `high`. The new `high` must be such that `low <= high` still holds. 
2. If `low` was updated to `mid + 1`, again `low` must still not exceed `high`.

Since we don't have specific values for `low` and `high`, we will ensure that the necessary condition of `low` being less than or equal to `high` is satisfied for continued execution. 

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `low` remains less than or equal to `high`. 

State: **`arr` must not be empty; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
