Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the task of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number (`num`) in a sorted array (`arr`). Here's why it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description:

1. **Input Specification**: The function `func_1` accepts two arguments: `arr`, a list of sorted integers, and `num`, an integer. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Finding the First Occurrence**: The function uses a loop to iterate through the elements of the sorted list `arr`. Using `enumerate`, it keeps track of both the index `i` and the value `x` as it goes through the list. When it finds an element (`x`) that matches `num`, it returns the index `i`. This behavior adheres to the requirement of finding the first occurrence of `num`.

3. **No Match Case**: If `num` is not found in the list after checking all elements, the function reaches the return statement that returns `-1`. This indicates that `num` was not found, which is also a requirement of the function.

4. **Efficiency Note**: While the program does perform a linear search, which may not be the most efficient method for large sorted arrays, it still satisfies the correctness requirements of the problem description. The function accurately identifies the presence of `num` in `arr` and returns the appropriate index or `-1` if not found.

Thus, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, confirming that it is correct.
