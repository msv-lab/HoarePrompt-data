Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr`, which is a sorted list of integers, and `num`, which is an integer. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Finding the First Occurrence**: The function uses a for loop with `enumerate(arr)` to iterate through the list. It checks each element `x` to see if it matches `num`. If a match is found, it immediately returns the index `i`, which represents the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`. This meets the requirement of finding the first occurrence, as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Handling Non-Existent Values**: If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function returns `-1`. This indicates that `num` is not present in the list, which is a reasonable behavior for search functions.

4. **Sorted Array Compliance**: Since the problem guarantees that `arr` is sorted and the function simply checks each element linearly, it is still effective for the problem's requirement. However, it could be optimized using binary search for larger datasets, but the current implementation is correct according to the problem's basic requirement.

Thus, the program fulfills the criteria set in the problem description for all potential cases, making it correct.
