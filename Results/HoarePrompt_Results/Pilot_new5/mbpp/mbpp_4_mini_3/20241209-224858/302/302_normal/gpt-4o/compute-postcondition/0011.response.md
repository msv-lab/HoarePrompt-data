In the given scenario, the variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The initial state indicates that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and it is known that the value at `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`. Since `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, it implies that `high` is now one less than its previous value.

The relevant variables from the initial state that remain unchanged include:
- `arr` must not be empty
- `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`
- The value at `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`
- The value at `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`

Thus, the output state updates only the value of `high`.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; the value at `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`; the value at `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`; `high` is equal to `mid - 1`.**
