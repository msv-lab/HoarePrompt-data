The value of `mid` is assigned the result of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The variables `low` and `high` are not defined in the initial state provided, but we know they must have valid numerical values for this operation to take place. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` must not be empty, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
