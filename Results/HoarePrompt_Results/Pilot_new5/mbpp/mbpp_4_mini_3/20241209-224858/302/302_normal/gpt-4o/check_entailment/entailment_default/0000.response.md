To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code and the provided information step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of the target in the array. If the target is found, it returns the index of its first occurrence; if not present, it returns -1. It also mentions that if the input list is empty, it will return -1.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The initial logic of the function seems to follow the problem description by:
   - Using binary search to efficiently find the target number.
   - Updating the `result` variable when the target is found.
   - Adjusting the search bounds (`low` and `high`) appropriately to ensure the first occurrence is captured.

2. The function appears to handle the case of an empty array by initializing `high` as `len(arr) - 1`, which would result in `high` being -1 if `arr` is empty. This leads to the while loop not executing and returning -1, which is the correct behavior.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- **All elements are the same:** If the target is present multiple times in the array (e.g., `[5, 5, 5, 5]` with a target of 5), the function correctly returns the index of the first occurrence due to the assignment `result = mid` and the adjustment of `high = mid - 1`.
- **Target not present:** If the target is not in the array, the program will return -1 correctly.

### Output Hints Accuracy:
The output hints state that the function returns the index of the first occurrence or -1 if not found, which aligns with the behavior of the code. The hints also imply that the function may work correctly for sorted lists and empty lists.

### Conclusion:
Upon evaluating the code, problem description, and output hints, the function `func_1` performs as required for all mentioned scenarios. The code correctly finds the first occurrence of a specified target in a sorted array and safely handles the edge case of an empty array.

Correctness: **True**. 

This is due to the function correctly implementing the binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of the target in a sorted array, in accordance with the problem description and the output hints provided.
