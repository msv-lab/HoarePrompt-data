The statement `low = mid + 1` updates the variable `low` to be one greater than the current value of `mid`. Given the initial state, we know that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. Since the value at `arr[mid]` is less than the `target`, it implies that the `target` must be in the right half of the array. 

The variables `arr`, `high`, and `target` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only variable that is updated is `low`, which now becomes `mid + 1`. 

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; the value at `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`, and the current value of `arr[mid]` is less than `target`; `low` is now `mid + 1`.**
