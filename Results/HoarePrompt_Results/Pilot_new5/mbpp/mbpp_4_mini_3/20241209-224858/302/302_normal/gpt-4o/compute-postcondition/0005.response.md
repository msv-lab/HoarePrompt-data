The variable `result` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is already defined as `(low + high) // 2`. The state of `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `target` is not affected by this assignment. Thus, the output state reflects that `result` now holds the index of the `target` value in the `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `result` is equal to `mid`, and the element at index `mid` of `arr` is equal to `target`.**
