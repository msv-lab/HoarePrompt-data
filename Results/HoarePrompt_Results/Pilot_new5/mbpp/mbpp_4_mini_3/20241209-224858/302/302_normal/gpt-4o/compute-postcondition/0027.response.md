The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as the floor division of `(low + high) // 2`, which means `high` will be decreased based on the current value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states.

Output State: **`arr` is not empty; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is the floor division of `(low + high) // 2`; `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
