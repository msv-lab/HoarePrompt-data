The variables `low` and `high` are assigned the values `0` and `len(arr) - 1`, respectively. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `len(arr)` gives the count of elements in `arr`. The specific value of `high` will depend on the length of `arr`, which is not provided. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers; `low` is 0; `high` is `len(arr) - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers; `low` is 0; `high` is `len(arr) - 1**
