According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second integer. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first integer in the list that is not equal to `num`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 integers, `i` must be updated to 1, and `x` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer in the list.**
