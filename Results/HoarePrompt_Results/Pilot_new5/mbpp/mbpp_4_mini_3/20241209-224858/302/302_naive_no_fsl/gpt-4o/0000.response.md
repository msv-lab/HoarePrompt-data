Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array using a binary search approach. 

### Explanation:
1. The function `func_1` initializes `low` and `high` pointers to define the search space.
2. It uses a while loop to iterate as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
3. When the middle element is equal to the target, it updates `result` and continues searching in the left half of the array (to find the first occurrence) by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
4. If the middle element is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer up to `mid + 1`. If it is greater, it moves the `high` pointer down to `mid - 1`.
5. The function finally returns `result`, which will either be the index of the first occurrence or `-1` if the target is not found.

The assertions provided cover various scenarios, including repeated elements and cases where the target is found at different indices. 

I cannot find any edge cases or missing logic that would cause the function to fail in identifying the first occurrence of the target number. Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements for all tested cases, confirming its correctness.
