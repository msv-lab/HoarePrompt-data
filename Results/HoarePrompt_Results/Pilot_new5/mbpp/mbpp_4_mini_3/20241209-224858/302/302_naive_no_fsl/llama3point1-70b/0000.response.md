Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple occurrences of the target number in the array. The problem description specifies that the function should find the index of the **first occurrence** of a given number in a sorted array. However, the implementation will return the index of the first occurrence correctly; however, it does not explicitly handle the scenario where the number does not exist in the array.

For example:
- If the input array is `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]` and `num = 2`, the expected output is `1` (the index of the first occurrence of `2`), which the program does return correctly.
- However, if the input array is `arr = []` (an empty array) and `num = 1`, the expected output is `-1`, which the program does return correctly.
- But the implementation does not account for edge cases like negative numbers, or very large numbers. 

Therefore, while the implementation works for a basic set of inputs, it does not thoroughly validate or handle all potential edge cases and thus is not fully compliant with the problem description. The specification should also include the handling of empty arrays or numbers that are less than any element in the sorted array. 

Thus, the program is incorrect as it lacks precision in the expected behavior for all potential inputs.
