The operation `total += n % 10` updates the value of `total` by adding the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 (which gives the last digit of `n`). The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than 0, meaning `n` can be any positive integer. Since the value of `total` starts at 0, it will now become equal to `n % 10`. 

The specific value of `total` will depend on the last digit of `n`, which is not specified in the initial state beyond being a positive integer. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that `n` is greater than 0, `total` is updated to be equal to `n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is equal to `n % 10`**
