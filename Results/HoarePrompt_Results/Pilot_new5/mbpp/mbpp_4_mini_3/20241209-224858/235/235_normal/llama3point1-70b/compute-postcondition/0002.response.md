Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning 0, as the sum of the digits of 0 is 0. The function does not account for negative integers or non-integer inputs, as it is assumed `n` is always a non-negative integer when called. **
