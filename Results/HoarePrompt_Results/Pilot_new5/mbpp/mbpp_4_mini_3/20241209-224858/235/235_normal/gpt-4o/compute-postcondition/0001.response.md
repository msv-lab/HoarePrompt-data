According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `n` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer, which means it could be 0 or any positive integer. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is 0**
