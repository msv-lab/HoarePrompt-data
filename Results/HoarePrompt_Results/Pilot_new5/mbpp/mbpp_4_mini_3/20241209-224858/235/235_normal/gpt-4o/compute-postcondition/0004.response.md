According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and is now equal to `n // 10`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 after this operation. This means that before applying the integer division, `n` must have been at least 1. Therefore, to ensure the loop can run again, we need to adjust the condition to reflect that `n` needs to have been greater than or equal to 1 before the division. 

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `total` is equal to `n % 10`, `n` is now equal to `n // 10`**
