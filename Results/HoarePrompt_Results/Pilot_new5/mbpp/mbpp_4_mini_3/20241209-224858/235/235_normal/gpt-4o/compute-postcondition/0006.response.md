The value of `n` is updated to `n // 10`, which means `n` is now reduced to its integer division by 10. This operation effectively removes the last digit of the original value of `n`. The variable `total` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `n` and the previous definition of `total`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is now equal to `n // 10`; `total` is equal to `n % 10 + (n // 10) % 10.**
