Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's why it adheres to the description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is designed to accept a single parameter `n`, which is specified to be a non-negative integer. The program assumes this condition is satisfied based on the precondition mentioned in the comments.

2. **Sum of Digits**: The function converts the integer `n` into a string using `str(n)`, allowing it to iterate over each digit in the number. It then uses a generator expression to convert each character (digit) back into an integer (`int(digit)`) and calculates the sum of these integers using the built-in `sum()` function.

3. **Output**: The result returned by the function is the sum of the digits of the non-negative integer `n`, which directly matches the requirement of the problem description.

The implementation correctly handles all non-negative integers and provides the expected output. Thus, it satisfies the problem's requirements comprehensively.
