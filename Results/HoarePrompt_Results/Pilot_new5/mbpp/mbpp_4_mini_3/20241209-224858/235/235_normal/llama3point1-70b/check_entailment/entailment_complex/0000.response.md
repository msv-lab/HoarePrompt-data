Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Here's why it meets the expectations:

1. **Input Requirements**: The function is designed to accept a non-negative integer `n`, as specified in the problem description. The program comments confirm that the state of the program before the function call ensures that `n` is indeed a non-negative integer.

2. **Sum of Digits**: The function converts the integer `n` to a string, allowing it to iterate over each digit. It then converts each character back to an integer and computes the sum of these integers using the `sum()` function. This logic accurately calculates the sum of the digits of the integer `n`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function handles the case where `n` is 0 correctly, returning 0 as the sum of its digits, which aligns with the expected behavior.

4. **Assumptions**: The program makes a clear assumption that the input will always be a non-negative integer. This means it does not need to handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, as these are outside the scope defined in the problem description.

Given these points, the function indeed performs the required calculations correctly and adheres to the conditions of the problem description for all valid inputs specified. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
