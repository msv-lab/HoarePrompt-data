Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to sum the digits of a non-negative integer. It does this by converting the integer to a string, iterating through each character (digit), converting each character back to an integer, and then summing these integers. 

For example:
- If the input is `123`, the function processes it as follows:
  - Converts `123` to the string `'123'`
  - Iterates over each character `'1'`, `'2'`, and `'3'`
  - Converts these characters to integers `1`, `2`, and `3`
  - Sums them to get `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`

Additionally, the function handles all non-negative integers correctly, including edge cases:
- For input `0`, the output is `0`, since the sum of the digits is `0`.
- For input `100`, the output is `1`, since the sum of the digits is `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`.

Thus, the logic holds for all potential cases of non-negative integers. Since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected, the program is correct.
