Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of the number (using `n % 10`), adds this digit to a total, and then removes the last digit from the number (using `n //= 10`). This process continues until all digits have been processed (i.e., `n` becomes 0).

The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the tested cases:
- For `func_1(345)`, the digits are 3, 4, and 5, which sum to 12.
- For `func_1(12)`, the digits are 1 and 2, which sum to 3.
- For `func_1(97)`, the digits are 9 and 7, which sum to 16.

Additionally, the function will handle other non-negative integers correctly, including edge cases such as:
- `func_1(0)` which should return 0, as the sum of no digits is 0.
- Any single-digit number (e.g., `func_1(5)` should return 5).

Since the function correctly sums the digits for all non-negative integers, I cannot find any cases where it fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
