#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where the values are integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing the key-value pairs from 'd' where the value is greater than or equal to 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` where all values are integers and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in the code.
