Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set out in the problem description. The function `func_1(d, n)` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and uses a dictionary comprehension to filter and return a new dictionary that only includes entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

Here's why the program works as intended:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a dictionary `d`, which is expected to have integer values, and an integer `n`. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary. It checks the condition `v >= n`:
   - If the condition is true, the key-value pair is included in the new dictionary.
   - If the condition is false, the key-value pair is excluded.

3. **Result**: The final output is a new dictionary that contains only those entries from `d` whose values are greater than or equal to `n`, which directly meets the requirement of "filtering the dictionary."

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles various scenarios such as:
   - When `d` is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary as there are no entries to evaluate.
   - When all values are less than `n`, it will again return an empty dictionary.
   - When all values meet the condition, it will return the original dictionary.

Because the function behaves correctly according to the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is verified as **True**.
