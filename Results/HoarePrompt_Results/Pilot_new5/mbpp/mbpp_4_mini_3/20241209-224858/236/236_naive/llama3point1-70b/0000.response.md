Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(nums)` correctly checks whether the specified list `nums` is sorted or not. It does this by comparing the original list to its sorted version using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. 

For any potential case:
- If the list is already sorted (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), it will return `True`.
- If the list is not sorted (e.g., `[3, 1, 2]`), it will return `False`.
- It correctly handles empty lists (e.g., `[]` returns `True`, as an empty list is considered sorted).
- It also handles lists with one element (e.g., `[5]` returns `True`, as a single element list is also sorted).

Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is affirmed.
