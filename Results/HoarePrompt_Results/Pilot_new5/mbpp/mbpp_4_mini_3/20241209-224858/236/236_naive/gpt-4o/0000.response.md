Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Here's an explanation of how it works:

1. It iterates through the list `lst` using a for-loop, comparing each element to its next neighbor.
2. If it finds any element that is greater than the following element (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.
3. If it finishes the loop without finding such a case, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

The assertions used to test the function provide a variety of cases:
- The first case tests a sorted list, which correctly returns `True`.
- The second case tests a list that has one out-of-order element (20 followed by 17), which correctly returns `False`.
- The third case also tests a list with a similar out-of-order situation (15 followed by 14), which also correctly returns `False`.

Since the function behaves correctly for the provided test cases and logically covers the requirements of the problem description without any apparent edge cases failing, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
