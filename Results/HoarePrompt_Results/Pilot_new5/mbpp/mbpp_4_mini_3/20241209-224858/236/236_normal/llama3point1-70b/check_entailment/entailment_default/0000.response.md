The program provided is intended to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The code:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
```

compares the original list `nums` to a sorted version of that list. If both are equal, it indicates that the list is sorted.

Initially, the code appears to be correct as it would logically return `True` for sorted lists and `False` for unsorted ones. The condition checks if the original list matches its sorted version, which is a direct approach to determine if it's sorted in non-decreasing order.

Now, let's evaluate some edge cases:
1. An empty list `[]` is considered sorted because there are no elements that can be out of order.
2. A list with a single element `[5]` is also considered sorted as there are no other elements to compare against.
3. A list with duplicate elements, such as `[1, 1, 1]`, should return `True`, as all elements are equal.

The output hints state that the function does not handle cases where `nums` is empty or contains only one element, but it also mentions that the function still correctly identifies those cases as sorted. This is consistent with the behavior of the function since both an empty list and a single-element list will return `True`.

Given that the function properly handles the described cases and adheres to the problem description, it doesn't leave any potential edge cases unaccounted for. The output hints align with this logic.

Correctness: **True**.  
The code correctly identifies sorted lists, including edge cases of empty lists and single-element lists, as sorted.
