Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and uses a list comprehension to iterate through the elements of `nums`. For each element `num`, it checks if `num` is odd by using the condition `num % 2 != 0`. This condition evaluates to `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers.

2. **Correct Return**: The list comprehension constructs a new list that includes only those numbers for which the condition holds true (i.e., only the odd numbers). If there are no odd numbers in the list, it returns an empty list, which is also the expected behavior.

3. **Empty and Non-integer Cases**: Although the code does not explicitly handle cases where `nums` may be empty or contain non-integer elements, the behavior of the list comprehension is robust enough that it can still return an empty list for an empty input. Furthermore, since the problem does not specify what to do with non-integer elements, the function's behavior in such scenarios does not violate the problem's requirements.

Overall, the function meets the problem's requirements of filtering odd numbers from a list of integers, hence it is correct.
