Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1(nums)` takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each integer in the list.
3. It applies the condition `num % 2 != 0` to check if each integer is odd. If true, the integer is included in the resulting list.
4. The function returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list.

The assertions provided in the annotated program further confirm the correctness of the implementation:
- The first assertion checks that the function correctly identifies and returns odd numbers from a sequence of integers, producing `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` from the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
- The second assertion checks another set of integers, returning `[45, 67, 93]` as the odd numbers from the input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`.
- The third assertion verifies that the input list `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]` results in the output `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, correctly identifying the odd numbers.

Since the function behaves as required by the problem description and handles the provided test cases correctly, it can be confidently stated that the program meets the requirements.
