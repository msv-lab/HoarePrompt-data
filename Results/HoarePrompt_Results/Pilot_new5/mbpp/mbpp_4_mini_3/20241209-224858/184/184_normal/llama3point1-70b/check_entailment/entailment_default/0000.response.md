The function `func_1(nums)` filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. The code uses a list comprehension to return a new list containing only the integers from the input list `nums` that satisfy the condition of being odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`).

Initial assessment based on the problem description:
- The function seems to fulfill the requirement of filtering odd numbers from the provided list of integers.
- It correctly checks each number in the list and returns those that are odd.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
1. An empty list: The function should return an empty list, which it does correctly.
2. A list containing non-integer elements: The function does not handle cases where `nums` might contain types that are not integers. This could raise a `TypeError` when attempting to perform the modulus operation on a non-integer type, such as a string or float.

Now, let's look at the output hints:
- The output hints state that the function returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the list `nums` and that it does not handle cases where `nums` may be empty or contain non-integer elements. However, it correctly returns an empty list if there are no odd integers.

The output hints align with the code but highlight a significant issue: the function does not handle non-integer inputs. If the `nums` list contains any non-integer values, the function will raise an error, which goes against the requirement of robustness in software development.

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code does not handle cases with non-integer elements in the input list, which can lead to runtime errors. For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 'three', 4]`, the function will raise a TypeError. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
