Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which requires finding the ASCII value of a character. The function `func_1` uses the `ord()` function, which returns the Unicode code point of a given character. 

In the context of ASCII:
- The ASCII values for characters 'A', 'R', and 'S' are correctly asserted as 65, 82, and 83, respectively.
- Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, the `ord()` function will return the correct ASCII value for any valid single character input from the ASCII range.

Thus, the function consistently adheres to the requirements specified in the problem description for any single character input, demonstrating that it will always return the correct ASCII value.
