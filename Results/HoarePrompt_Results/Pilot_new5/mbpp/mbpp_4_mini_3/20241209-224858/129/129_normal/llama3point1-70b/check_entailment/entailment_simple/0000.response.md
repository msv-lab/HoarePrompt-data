Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the ASCII value of a character. The function `func_1` takes a single character string as input and uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of that character.

Here's why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description states that the input should be a single character string. The function explicitly takes a parameter `char`, which is expected to be a single character.

2. **Correct Functionality**: The function uses `ord(char)` to obtain the ASCII value of the character. The `ord()` function in Python accurately returns the ASCII value for characters in the standard ASCII range (0-127) and also works for extended Unicode code points when applicable.

3. **Output Specification**: The function returns an integer, which is the ASCII value of the given character, aligning perfectly with the requirement stated in the problem description.

Thus, the program behaves correctly for any valid input that adheres to the specification of a single character string. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description.
