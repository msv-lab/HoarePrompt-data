Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. While it correctly returns the ASCII value of a single character string using the `ord()` function, it fails to handle potential problematic cases. Specifically:

1. If the input `char` is not a single character string (e.g., if it's an empty string or a string with more than one character), the function does not raise an error or return a meaningful value. This can lead to a TypeError or unintended behavior.

2. The problem description explicitly asks for the ASCII value of a character, but the function does not validate whether the input is indeed a single character. If the input does not meet this criteria, the function's behavior is undefined.

Thus, due to these omissions in handling edge cases, the program does not fully align with the problem description.
