Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the ASCII value of a character using the built-in `ord()` function. It has been tested with several assertions that check the ASCII values of specific characters ('A', 'R', 'S'), and these cases are handled correctly. 

Additionally, since the function `ord()` works for all single-character strings, it will accurately return the ASCII value for any valid input character. The code does not have any edge cases that it fails to handle, such as non-character inputs or empty strings, since the problem description specifically states to find the ASCII value of a character, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness for valid single-character inputs. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.
