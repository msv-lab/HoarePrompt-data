Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not correctly handle the case where the input string is not a single character. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to return the ASCII value of a "single character." However, if the input string contains more than one character or is empty, the function will still attempt to return the ASCII value, which will lead to incorrect behavior.

For example:
- If `char` is an empty string (`""`), calling `func_1("")` will raise a `TypeError` because `ord()` expects a string of length 1.
- If `char` is a string with more than one character (e.g., `"ab"`), calling `func_1("ab")` will also raise a `TypeError`.

Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description that specifies the input should be a single character. Thus, it is incorrect.
