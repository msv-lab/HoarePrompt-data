To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: 
   - An integer `n` representing the size of the permutation.
   - A list of `n` distinct integers which is a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`.

2. **Output**: 
   - The maximum possible distance between the minimum element (which is `1`) and the maximum element (which is `n`) after performing exactly one swap.

### Program Logic Analysis
1. The program reads the size of the permutation and the permutation itself.
2. It finds the positions of `1` (the minimum) and `n` (the maximum) in the list using `index()`.
3. It calculates the current distance between `1` and `n` using their positions.
4. The maximum distance achievable after one swap is determined by considering the positions of `1` and `n` and calculating potential distances when swapped with elements at the edges of the list.

### Key Observations
- The distance between the minimum and maximum elements is initially calculated. The distance can be increased by potentially swapping `1` or `n` with an element at the opposite end of the list.
- The formula `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` appears to be incorrect for calculating the maximum distance achievable after one swap because it does not consider all possible swap scenarios properly.

### Potential Cases
To find a case where the code does not work:
- Consider the input where `n = 5` and the permutation is `[1, 5, 4, 3, 2]`.
  - Here, the positions are `pos1 = 0` and `posn = 1`. The current distance is `abs(0 - 1) = 1`.
  - The program calculates distances but does not account properly for swapping `1` with `2` at the end of the list to achieve a maximum distance of `4`.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly compute the maximum distance in certain scenarios because it does not account for all possible swaps properly. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases effectively where the positions of `1` and `n` need to be swapped with elements at the edges to maximize distance.
