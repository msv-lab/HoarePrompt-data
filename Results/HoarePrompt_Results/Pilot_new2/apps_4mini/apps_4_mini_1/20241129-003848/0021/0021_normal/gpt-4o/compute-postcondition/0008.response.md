The variable `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are computed based on the indices `min_pos` and `max_pos`, where `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. 

The exact values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` depend on the specific values of `min_pos` and `max_pos`. However, we can express `max_distance` as follows:

- `dist1 = abs(max_pos)`
- `dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`
- `dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)`
- `dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`
- `max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)`

The states of `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, and `max_pos` are not directly altered, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`; `max_distance` is equal to `max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)`.**
