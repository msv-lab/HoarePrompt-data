The code snippet assigns a value to `dist2`. It calculates `dist2` as the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`. Given `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, the value of `dist2` is dependent on the values of `n` and `max_pos`. 

The previous state remains valid, and we update `dist2` with the newly calculated value. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos`.**
