The code assigns the value of `pos1` to the index of the value `1` in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers provided by the user, and it contains the integer `1`, the position of `1` in the list is determined with `a.index(1)`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, but `pos1` will now hold the index where `1` is located in the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the user-provided input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers input by the user in the range from 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`.**
