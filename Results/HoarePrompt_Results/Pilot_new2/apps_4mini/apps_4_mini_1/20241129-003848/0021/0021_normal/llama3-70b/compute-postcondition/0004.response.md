To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the initial variables.

1. `pos1` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`, and `posn` is the index of the value `n` in the list `a`.
2. We calculate `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`, which gives us the absolute distance between the indices of 1 and n, minus 1.
3. The expression `n - 2` represents the total number of elements in the list minus the first and last elements.
4. The `max()` function will determine the larger value between these two calculations.

The variable `max_dist` is affected by the calculation, and its value will depend on the specific values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` provided by the user.

Since `n` is an integer in the range of [2, 100] and `a` is a list of distinct integers, we cannot determine the specific numerical results without knowing the values of `pos1` and `posn`.

However, we can express the relationship mathematically:

- Let `d1 = abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`
- Let `d2 = n - 2`
- Then `max_dist` will be assigned `max(d1, d2)`.

Putting this together, we maintain the constraints and conditions from the initial state and update only the `max_dist` variable based on the provided calculations.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the user-provided input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers input by the user in the range from 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of the value `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`**.
