The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by converting input strings to integers. The input consists of `n` distinct integers, and since `a` is derived from this input, it will hold those distinct integers. The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is only used to determine the number of elements in `a`. The range of integers in `a` will also still satisfy the condition that each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive. Thus, the output state is updated to reflect the new value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input.**
