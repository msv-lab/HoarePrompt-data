The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The output is determined based on the constraints of an integer `s`, which is implied to be in the range of 0 to 99. However, since there are no explicit cases or return values provided in the output description, we cannot ascertain the specific functionality or results of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is not clearly defined based on the given information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
