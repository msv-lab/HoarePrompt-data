Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` in the range from 0 to 99 and returns its English word representation. It returns 'zero' to 'nine' for values 0 to 9, 'eleven' to 'nineteen' for values 11 to 19, the words for multiples of ten such as 'ten', 'twenty', etc., for values 10, 20, ..., 90, and for other values between 10 and 99, it returns a combination of the tens and ones place (e.g., 'twenty-one', 'thirty-five'). However, the function does not handle the cases for 10 and 20 correctly, as it misses the representation for 10 and does not account for the word 'ten' when n equals 10. Additionally, it will not return any output for the value of 100 or higher, though inputs are only expected to be between 0 and 99.**
