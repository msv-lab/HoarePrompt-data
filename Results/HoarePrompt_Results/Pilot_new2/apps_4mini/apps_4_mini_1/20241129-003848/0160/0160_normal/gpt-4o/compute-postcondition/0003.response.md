The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the `divisors` set. Given that `x` is divisible by `i`, this means that `i` is a divisor of `x`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N positive integers A (1 <= A_i <= 10^6); `divisors` now includes the value `i`; `i` is 1.**
