To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

Initial State: 
- `x` is a tuple where:
  - The first element is a positive integer `N` (2 <= N <= 500)
  - The second element is a non-negative integer `K` (0 <= K <= 10^9)
  - The third element is a list of `N` positive integers `A` (1 <= A_i <= 10^6)
- `i` is 2
- `divisors` now includes the value 2.

Now we analyze the code snippet:
```python
divisors.add(x // i)
```
Here, `x` is a tuple, and `x // i` implies performing floor division on the first element of the tuple because `x` cannot be directly divided as a tuple.

1. `x[0]` represents the positive integer `N`.
2. We perform floor division: `x[0] // i`, which is `N // 2`.
3. The result of `N // 2` will be added to the set `divisors`. 

Since `divisors` already includes the value 2, after executing this line, `divisors` will still include the value 2 and also include `N // 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `divisors` set and retains the information about `N`, `K`, and `A`.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer `N` (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer `K` (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of `N` positive integers `A` (1 <= A_i <= 10^6); `i` is 2; `divisors` now includes the values 2 and `N // 2`.**
