According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since the loop is set to run from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, we need to determine if `i` can increment to allow one more iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N-1`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, the next value of `i` will be `N`. 

We also need to ensure that `N` does not exceed `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, so for the loop to execute again, `N` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

In summary, the next state should reflect that `i` is now `N`, and for the loop to proceed, `N` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

State: **`K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than 0, `i` is N, `N` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`**
