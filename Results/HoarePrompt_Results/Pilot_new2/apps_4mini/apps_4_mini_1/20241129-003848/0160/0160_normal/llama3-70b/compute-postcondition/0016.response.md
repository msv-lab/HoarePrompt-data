Postcondition: ***`K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than 0, `i` is N-1. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // (N-1)`.***
