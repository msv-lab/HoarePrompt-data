To determine the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, let's analyze the functions and their respective annotations based on the requirements specified.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to perform operations between two integers from a sequence of size N, modify them, and ultimately compute the maximum positive integer that divides every element of the modified sequence after performing at most K operations.

### Function 1 Analysis (`func_1`)
- This function calculates the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of all the integers in the list `lst[1:]` (the sequence of integers).
- The function does not consider the operations allowed (up to K times), which means it simply computes the GCD of the original list without any modifications.
  
**Implication**: This function is incomplete with respect to the problem description because it fails to take into account how the allowed operations affect the GCD of the sequence.

### Function 2 Analysis (`func_2`)
- This function calculates the divisors of the first element of the tuple `x` (which is supposed to be N) and returns them sorted in reverse order.
- It does not utilize the values of K or the list of integers A at all. Thus, it does not contribute to solving the problem as it ignores both the operations and the actual numbers we need to consider.

**Implication**: This function also does not follow the problem description as it does not compute the divisors affecting the values in A after K allowed operations.

### Overall Assessment
- Both functions do not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The main issue is that neither function handles the operations allowed (up to K) that can modify the sequence of integers A.
- The problem description requires examining how A can be manipulated through the allowed operations to achieve the maximum divisor, but this logic is absent in the code.
  
**Counterexample**: Suppose we have the input:
```
2 3
8 20
```
The expected output based on the maximum divisor that can be achieved after the operations is 7 (as shown in the problem description). However, the current functions would not compute this because they do not consider the operations that can change the values of A.

### Conclusion
Since the functions do not implement the logic required by the problem description and do not account for the operations that could affect the outcome, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
