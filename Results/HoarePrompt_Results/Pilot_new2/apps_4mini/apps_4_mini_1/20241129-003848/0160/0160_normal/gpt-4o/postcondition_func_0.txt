The function accepts a list of integers where the first element represents `N` (the number of integers) and the subsequent elements represent integers for which the greatest common divisor (gcd) is to be calculated. It returns the gcd of all integers in the list starting from the second element. The function does not validate the input list against the stated constraints but assumes the list follows the specified format.
