You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N.
You can perform the following operation between 0 and K times (inclusive):
 - Choose two integers i and j such that i \neq j, each between 1 and N (inclusive). Add 1 to A_i and -1 to A_j, possibly producing a negative element.
Compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Here a positive integer x divides an integer y if and only if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 500
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_{N-1} A_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3
8 20

-----Sample Output-----
7

7 will divide every element of A if, for example, we perform the following operation:
 - Choose i = 2, j = 1. A becomes (7, 21).
We cannot reach the situation where 8 or greater integer divides every element of A.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where the first two elements represent N (the number of integers) and K (the number of allowed operations), followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N such that 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for each integer A_i.
def func_1(lst):
    gcd_result = lst[0]
    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers where the first element (N) must be at least 1, `num` is the last element of `lst` (i.e., `lst[N-1]`), and `gcd_result` is the gcd of all integers in `lst[1:]`.
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns the gcd of all integers in 'lst[1:]'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N positive integers A where each A_i (1 <= A_i <= 10^6).
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer `N` (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer `K` (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of `N` positive integers `A` (1 <= A_i <= 10^6). `divisors` is a set that contains all divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`, including both `i` and `x // i` for each valid `i`.
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of all divisors of the first element N in tuple x, in reverse order. The divisors are calculated up to the square root of N, including both i and N // i for each valid i.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
