The code initializes `divisors` as an empty set. The values of `x` remain unchanged as this operation does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N positive integers A where each A_i (1 <= A_i <= 10^6); `divisors` is an empty set.
