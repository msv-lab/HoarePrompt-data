Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, if `time` (calculated as `(t - s) % d`) is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time`, `i` is set to 1, and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `min_time` remains `float('inf')`.***
