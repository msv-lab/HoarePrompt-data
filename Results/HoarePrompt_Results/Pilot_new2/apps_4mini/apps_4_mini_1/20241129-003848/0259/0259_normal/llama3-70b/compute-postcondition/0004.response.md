The code appends a tuple containing the values of `s` and `d` to the list `buses`. The variables `n`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The values of `s` and `d` are taken as input integers. Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged variables along with the new addition to the `buses` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `_` can be considered as 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `buses` now contains a tuple `(s, d)`**.
