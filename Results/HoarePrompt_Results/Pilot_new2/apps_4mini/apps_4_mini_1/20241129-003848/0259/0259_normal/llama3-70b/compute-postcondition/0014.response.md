According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. For the loop to execute, `buses` must contain at least one tuple, which is ensured by the condition `1 <= n <= 100` (since `n` indicates the number of tuples in `buses`). The loop will iterate over each tuple in `buses`, and the index `i` will start at 0. The values of `s` and `d` will correspond to the elements of the first tuple in the list.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `buses` must contain `n` tuples, `i` is initialized to `0`, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, and `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` now contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, `min_time` is `float('inf')`, `ans` is `-1`, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`**
