The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which takes two space-separated integers as input. The previous state indicates that `s` and `d` were input integers, and after executing the code, they will now hold the values of the integers provided as input. The tuple `buses` is updated by appending the new tuple `(s, d)` to it. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the changes in `s`, `d`, and the updated `buses`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`; `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`; `_` is equal to `n + 1`; `s` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; `buses` now contains a tuple `(s, d)` appended to it.**
