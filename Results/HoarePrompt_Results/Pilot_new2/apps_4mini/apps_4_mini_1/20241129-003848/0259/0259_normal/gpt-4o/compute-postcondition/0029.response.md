`wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is the first element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`, and `t` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^5`, `s_i` is also a positive integer as it is part of the tuple in `bus_routes`. Therefore, the value of `wait_time` will be a specific integer value, which is the result of the calculation `s_i - t`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `i` is the next index which is less than `n`; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `s_i` is the first element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `d_i` is the second element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`.**
