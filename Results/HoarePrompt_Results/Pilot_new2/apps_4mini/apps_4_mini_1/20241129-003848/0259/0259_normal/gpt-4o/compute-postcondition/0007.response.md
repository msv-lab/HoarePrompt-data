Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is less than `t`, and the current value of `t - s_i` is divisible by `d_i` (i.e., (t - s_i) % d_i == 0)***
