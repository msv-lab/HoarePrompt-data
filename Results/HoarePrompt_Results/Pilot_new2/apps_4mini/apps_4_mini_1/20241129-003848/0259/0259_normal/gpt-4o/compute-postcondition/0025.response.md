The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, its value is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is equal to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is equal to `i + 1.**
