Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to be equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
