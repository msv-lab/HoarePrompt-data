The value of `min_wait_time` is assigned to positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This indicates that `min_wait_time` is now set to the highest possible value, suggesting that it is ready to be updated with any lower actual wait time that may be calculated later. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5, and `min_wait_time` is float('inf').
