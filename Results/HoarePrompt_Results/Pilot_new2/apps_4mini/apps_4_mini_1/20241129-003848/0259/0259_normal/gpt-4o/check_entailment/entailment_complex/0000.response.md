Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: an integer `n` (the number of bus routes), an integer `t` (the time Serval arrives at the bus station), and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains two integers representing the arrival time of the first bus (`s_i`) and the interval between subsequent buses (`d_i`).

2. **Wait Time Calculation**:
   - The program first initializes `min_wait_time` to infinity and `chosen_route` to -1, which will help in tracking the minimum wait time and the corresponding bus route index.
   - It iterates through each bus route, calculating the wait time based on the arrival time of the first bus (`s_i`) and the interval (`d_i`). 
   - The logic correctly determines the wait time:
     - If the first bus arrives after Serval reaches the station (`s_i >= t`), the wait time is `s_i - t`.
     - If Serval arrives exactly when a bus is scheduled (`(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), the wait time is 0.
     - For other cases, it calculates the wait time until the next bus arrives.

3. **Choosing the Optimal Bus Route**: 
   - During each iteration, the program compares the calculated `wait_time` with the current `min_wait_time`. If the current wait time is less, it updates `min_wait_time` and sets `chosen_route` to the current index (1-based).
   - This ensures that the program is always selecting the bus route with the least wait time, consistent with the problem requirements.

4. **Return Value**: 
   - The function returns the 1-based index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. If all buses are scheduled to arrive after time `t`, `chosen_route` remains -1, which would indicate no suitable route is available.
   - However, the problem states that if there are multiple buses arriving at the same time, any one of them can be printed, which the program naturally accommodates by returning the first one found in case of ties.

Thus, the program adheres strictly to the problem description and correctly computes the desired output based on the provided logic and calculations for various input cases. Therefore, it is correct.
