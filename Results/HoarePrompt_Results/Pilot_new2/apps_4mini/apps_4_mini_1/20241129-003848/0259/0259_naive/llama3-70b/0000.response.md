To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze it step-by-step.

The problem states that we need to determine which bus route Serval will take based on the arrival times of buses after he arrives at the bus station at time `t`. Each bus route has a first bus arrival time `s_i` and an interval `d_i`.

### Key Points:
1. **Buses Arrival Times**:  
   Each bus route's buses arrive at times `s_i`, `s_i + d_i`, `s_i + 2*d_i`, and so forth. 
   
2. **Serval's Arrival**:  
   We need to determine which bus is the first bus that arrives at or after time `t`. 

3. **Finding the First Bus**:  
   For each bus with first arrival time `s_i`:
   - If `s_i >= t`, then the first bus Serval can take is the first bus itself.
   - If `s_i < t`, we need to find the smallest `k` such that `s_i + k*d_i >= t`, which translates to `k >= (t - s_i) / d_i`. The smallest integer `k` can be calculated as `ceil((t - s_i) / d_i)`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The expression `(t - s) % d` is not correct for determining the next bus arrival time after `t`. This expression gives the remainder of `t - s` divided by `d`, which does not help in identifying whether a bus arrives before or after `t`.
- Specifically, when `t < s`, the program would incorrectly compute a time that should never be negative, and will not correctly identify the first bus Serval can take.

### Example Case to Demonstrate Failure:
Consider the input:
```
1 5
3 2
```
Here, Serval arrives at time `5`, and the first bus of the only route arrives at time `3` with an interval of `2`. The buses will arrive at `3`, `5`, `7`, etc. 
- According to the correct logic, Serval can take the bus arriving at `5`, so the output should be `1`.
- However, using the program logic, `(t - s) % d` will compute `2 % 2`, which is `0`, leading to wrong conclusions based on the current implementation.

### Conclusion:
Since there are potential cases where the program does not behave as expected, the program is incorrect. 

Correctness: **False**.
