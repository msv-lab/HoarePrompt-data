The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer and not a multiple of 10, the new value of `n` will still be a positive integer and will not be a multiple of 10, unless it was 9. In which case, it would become 10, violating the condition. Therefore, `n` can take any positive integer value except 9, ensuring that after the increment, it does not equal 10. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 10**.
