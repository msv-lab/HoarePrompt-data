To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).
   - `k` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq k \leq 8 \).
   - `multiplier` is either \( 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, \) or \( 100000000 \) depending on the value of `k`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code computes `x` as follows:
     \[
     x = n \times \left( \frac{\text{multiplier}}{\text{math.gcd}(n, \text{multiplier})} \right)
     \]
   - This means that `x` will take the value of `n` multiplied by the `multiplier` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `multiplier`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `x` is calculated based on the current values of `n` and `multiplier`.
   - Since `n` and `multiplier` remain unchanged by the calculation of `x`, they retain their original values.

4. **Output State**:
   - We specify `x` in terms of its calculation, while the values of `n` and `multiplier` remain as defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state will include the original conditions for `n` and `multiplier`, along with the newly calculated value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000; `x` is equal to `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`.**
