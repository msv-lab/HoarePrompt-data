The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The conditions regarding `b` and `a`, `c` not being equal to 0, and either `(b - a) % c` not being equal to 0 or `(b - a) / c` being less than 0 still hold true after execution.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that are equal to the three integers input by the user, `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0; 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
