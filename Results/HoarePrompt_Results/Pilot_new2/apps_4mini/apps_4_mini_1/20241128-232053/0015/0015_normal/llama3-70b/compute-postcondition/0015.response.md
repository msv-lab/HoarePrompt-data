Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` via user input. If `c` is 0 and `a` equals `b`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `b - a` is divisible by `c` and non-negative; if both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints output based on the conditions evaluated. **
