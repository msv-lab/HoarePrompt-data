The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new values based on user input. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes a string input, splits it into separate values, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are replaced with the new integer values provided by the user.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that are now equal to the three integers input by the user.**
