According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the contents of `s`. The loop can execute as long as `char` (which is '|') is present in `s`. Right before the loop, `s` is either empty or contains characters greater than 'z', which means it does not contain the character '|'. 

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `s` needs to be modified so that it contains the character '|'. This can be achieved by making `s` contain at least one occurrence of '|'. Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` must contain '|'**
