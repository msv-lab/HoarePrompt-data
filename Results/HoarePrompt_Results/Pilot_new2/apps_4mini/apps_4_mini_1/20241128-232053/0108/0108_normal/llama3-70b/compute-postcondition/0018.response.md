According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains '|' with one occurrence of `char` replaced by `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. This means that the original character `char` must still be present in `s` for the loop to run one more time. 

To ensure that `char` is still in `s`, we would need to adjust the state so that `s` includes at least one occurrence of the original `char`. The adjustment can be made by stating that `s` must contain at least one occurrence of `char` after the last iteration.

State: **`s` must contain at least one occurrence of the original `char`, `res` is updated to `res + char`**
