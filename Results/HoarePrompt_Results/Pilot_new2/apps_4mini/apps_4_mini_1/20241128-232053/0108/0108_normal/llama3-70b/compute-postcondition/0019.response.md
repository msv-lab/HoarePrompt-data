`res` is updated by appending `char` to its current value. Since `s` must contain at least one occurrence of `char`, this means that `char` is a valid character present in `s`. The value of `res` will now include the additional `char`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` must contain at least one occurrence of the original `char`; `res` is updated to `res + char`.**
