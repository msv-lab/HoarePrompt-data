In the given code snippet, `s` undergoes a modification where the first occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet, which is determined by taking the Unicode value of `char`, adding 1, and converting it back to a character using `chr()`.

1. `s` initially contains `char`. After replacing `char` with its successor, the state of `s` will change.
2. The variable `res` is concatenated with `char`, but its original content is not altered by this line of code.
3. The value of `char` is updated to be `res` concatenated with the original `char`, which means `char` changes but is not directly affected by the replace action.
4. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State will include the updated value of `s`, the new value of `char`, and indicate that `res` retains its original concatenation.

Output State: **`s` is `s` with `char` replaced by `chr(ord(char) + 1)`; `res` is the original `res` concatenated with `char`; `char` is `res + char`; `n` remains unchanged.**
