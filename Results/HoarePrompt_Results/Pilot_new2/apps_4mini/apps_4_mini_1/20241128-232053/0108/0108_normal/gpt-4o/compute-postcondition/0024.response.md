Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters. It checks whether all characters of the English alphabet (from 'a' to 'z') appear in `s` in the correct order. If all characters are present, it prints the complete alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any values; it only prints to the console. **
