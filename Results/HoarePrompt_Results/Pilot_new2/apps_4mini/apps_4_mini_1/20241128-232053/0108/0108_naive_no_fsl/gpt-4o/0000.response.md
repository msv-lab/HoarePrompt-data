Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. While it checks if the string `s` contains the characters of the English alphabet as a subsequence, it does not account for the ability to replace characters in `s` to reach the target string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

For instance, consider the input string:

```
s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy"
```

Currently, this string is missing the character 'z' to complete the alphabet. The program will check if the subsequence exists and will return `-1`, claiming it is impossible. However, the problem states that we can make replacements to achieve a string that contains the alphabet as a subsequence.

Another case could be:
```
s = "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
```
In this case, even though the string is filled with 'z's, the program would return `-1` because it does not consider the possibility of replacing 'z's to create a valid subsequence.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements as it does not handle replacements, leading to incorrect outputs for certain valid inputs.
