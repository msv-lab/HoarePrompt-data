The line of code `used_cubes[i] = True` assigns the value `True` to the `i`-th index of the `used_cubes` list. Since `i` is less than `n`, this means that the index is valid, and the operation will succeed. The initial state indicates that `used_cubes[0]` is already `True`, and depending on the value of `i`, either `used_cubes[1]` or `used_cubes[2]` will be set to `True`. 

Since `i` must be less than `n` and `n` can take values from 1 to 3, we consider the possible cases:
- If `n = 1`, then `i` must be `0`, and the operation does not change `used_cubes[0]`.
- If `n = 2`, then `i` can be `0` or `1`. If `i = 0`, no change occurs. If `i = 1`, then `used_cubes[1]` becomes `True`.
- If `n = 3`, then `i` can be `0`, `1`, or `2`. If `i = 0`, no change occurs. If `i = 1`, then `used_cubes[1]` becomes `True`. If `i = 2`, then `used_cubes[2]` becomes `True`.

Since the output state needs to reflect the impact of the code while maintaining valid information, we state the conditions including the final values of `used_cubes` based on the possible scenarios for `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, with `used_cubes[0]` being True; if `i = 0`, `used_cubes` remains unchanged; if `i = 1`, `used_cubes[1]` is True; if `i = 2`, `used_cubes[2]` is True and `used_cubes[1]` is True.**
