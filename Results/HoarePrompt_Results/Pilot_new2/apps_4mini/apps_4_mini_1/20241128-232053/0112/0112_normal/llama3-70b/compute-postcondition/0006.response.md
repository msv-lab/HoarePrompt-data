The code updates `digits` to include the string representations of integers from `cube`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3, the variable `cubes` consists of at least 2 sublists. The variable `cube` is defined as the second sublist in `cubes`.

The impact of the code is that `digits` will now contain string representations of all the integers found in the `cube`. The values of `n`, `cubes`, and `cube` remain the same, while `digits` is modified to include the new elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists; `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include the string representations of integers from `cube`.**
