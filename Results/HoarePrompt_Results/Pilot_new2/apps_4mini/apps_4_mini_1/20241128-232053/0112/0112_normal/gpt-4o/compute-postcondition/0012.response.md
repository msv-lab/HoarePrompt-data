The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state, so there is no change in its value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` as `True` and `used_cubes[1]` as `True`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is an element of `digits`, `found` is `True`, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[i]` is `True`, `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`**.
