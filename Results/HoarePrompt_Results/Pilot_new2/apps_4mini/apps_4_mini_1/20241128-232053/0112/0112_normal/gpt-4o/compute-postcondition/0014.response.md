Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` as `True` and `used_cubes[1]` as `True`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is an element of `digits`, `found` is `True`, `i` is 1, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`, if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is updated to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
