The code simply prints the value of `max_num`. The value of `max_num` has been formed by sorting the `digits` set in descending order and joining them into a single number. Since there are no changes made to the variables or their states, the output will only reflect the printed value of `max_num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of 3 lists of integers; `digits` is a set containing the string representations of all integers from all sublists in `cubes`; `max_num` is the integer formed by sorting `digits` in descending order and joining them into a single number; the value of `max_num` has been printed.**
