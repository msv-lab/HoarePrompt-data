Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`. If `used_cubes[0]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[0]`, then `used_cubes[0]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `used_cubes[0]` remains unchanged, and `found` remains False.***
