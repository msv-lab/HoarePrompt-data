In the provided code, `digits` is updated to include the string representations of integers from `cube`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3, we can conclude that `n` must equal 3. Therefore, `cubes` is a list containing exactly 3 sublists, and `cube` refers to the third sublist in this list.

The variable `digits` will include the string representations of all integers from the `cube` sublist.

Since the output of `digits` will change based on the integers present in `cube`, we don't have the specific values of `cube` or `digits` before the update. However, we know the following:

- `n` is equal to 3.
- `cubes` is a list of 3 sublists.
- `cube` is the third sublist in `cubes`.
- `digits` will now include the string representations of integers from `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is 3; `cubes` is a list of 3 sublists; `cube` is the third sublist in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of integers from `cube`.**
