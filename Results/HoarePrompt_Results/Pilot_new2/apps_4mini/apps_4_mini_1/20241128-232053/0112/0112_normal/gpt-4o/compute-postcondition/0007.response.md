The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. This changes the state of `found` from `False` to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to `True` and the remaining elements set to `False`; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is the first element in `digits`; `found` is True; `i` is 0; `used_cubes[i]` is `True`; `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.**
