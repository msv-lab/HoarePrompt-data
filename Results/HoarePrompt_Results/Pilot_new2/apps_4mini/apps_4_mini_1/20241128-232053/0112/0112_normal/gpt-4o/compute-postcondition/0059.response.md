According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` will be incremented by 1). After this iteration, `i` will become 2. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes` remains the same**
