Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list where elements may be either True or False based on whether the corresponding cube face matched the digit, and `found` is False indicating that no matching cube has been found. The state of `used_cubes` reflects which cubes have been marked as used.***
