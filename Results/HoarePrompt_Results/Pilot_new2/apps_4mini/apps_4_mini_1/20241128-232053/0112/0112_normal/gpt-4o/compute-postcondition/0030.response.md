The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` is True; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is the next element in `digits` from index `0`; `found` is True; `i` is 0; `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
