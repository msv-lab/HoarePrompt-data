The code takes a variable `num` (which is not defined in the initial state) and converts it to a string, then creates a list of its digits. Since there is no information about the initial value of `num`, we cannot determine the specific digits. Therefore, `digits` will be a list of characters representing the digits of whatever value `num` might hold.

The output state reflects the fact that `digits` is now a list of strings, but we cannot specify its content without knowing `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and each of the next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing the digits on the faces of the cubes; `digits` is a list of the digits of `num` as strings, where `num` is an undefined integer.**
