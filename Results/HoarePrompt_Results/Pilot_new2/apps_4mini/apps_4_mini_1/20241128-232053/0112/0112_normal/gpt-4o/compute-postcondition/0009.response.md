Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to `True` and the remaining elements set to `False`; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is an element of `digits`; `found` is `True`; `i` is 0; `used_cubes[i]` is `True`; and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
