The code assigns `True` to `used_cubes[i]`. Since `i` is 2, this means `used_cubes[2]` is set to `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions specify that `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes` remains the same except for the updated index.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[2]` is True**
