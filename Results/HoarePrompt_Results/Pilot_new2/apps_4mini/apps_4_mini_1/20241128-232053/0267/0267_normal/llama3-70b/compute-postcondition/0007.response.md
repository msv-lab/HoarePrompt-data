The variable `dp` at the index `(n, k)` is assigned the value of `n`. Given that the current state specifies that the pair `(n, k)` is not in `dp`, it means that now this pair will be added to `dp` with the value of `n`. The initial conditions for `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `k` is not equal to 0; `dp[n, k]` is now equal to `n`.**
