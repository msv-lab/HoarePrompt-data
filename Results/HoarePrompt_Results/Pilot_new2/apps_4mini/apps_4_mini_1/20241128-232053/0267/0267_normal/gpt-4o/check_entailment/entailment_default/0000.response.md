To evaluate the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description, let's analyze the code thoroughly.

### Summary of Problem Description
The task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (including both) that contain at most `k` different digits and return this sum modulo `998244353`.

### Function Analysis
1. **Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`**
   - This function checks if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - The logic appears to be correct, as it converts `n` to a string, creates a set of its characters (which gives unique digits), and checks if the size of this set is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(l, r, k)`**
   - This function calculates the total sum of numbers in the range from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition defined in `func_1`.
   - It iterates through each number in the range, uses `func_1` to check the digit condition, and accumulates the sum modulo `998244353`.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
- The program iterates through each number from `l` to `r`. Given that `l` and `r` can be as large as `10^18`, this approach can yield a massive number of iterations, leading to inefficiency and potential timeouts.
- The program does not handle cases where `l` equals `r` efficiently. If `l` and `r` are the same, it needs to check only that single number, which is currently correct but could be optimized.
- When `k` is set to a value greater than or equal to the number of digits in `r`, it may still perform unnecessary checks on numbers that are guaranteed to have valid digit counts.

### Comparison with Output Hints
- The output hints for both functions align with their respective implementations and the problem description. The first function accurately identifies which numbers have the allowed number of unique digits. The second function correctly computes the sum based on this check.

### Conclusion
While the logic of the code seems to align with the problem definition, the program can potentially fail to perform efficiently given the input constraints. Therefore, it may not handle all edge cases properly, especially with very large ranges.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Reason for Incorrectness
The program does not efficiently handle the constraints where `l` and `r` can be very large. Given the upper limit of `10^18`, iterating through every number from `l` to `r` is infeasible, making the approach inefficient and potentially resulting in a timeout for larger ranges.
