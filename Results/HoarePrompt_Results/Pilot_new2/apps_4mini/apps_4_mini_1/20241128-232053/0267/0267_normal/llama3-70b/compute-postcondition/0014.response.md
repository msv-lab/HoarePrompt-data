According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` relative to `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is an integer such that \(1 < k \leq 10\). 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3 after this iteration. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 3.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 < `k` <= 10 and `k` must be greater than 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `i` is 3, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90 * (10**...`**
