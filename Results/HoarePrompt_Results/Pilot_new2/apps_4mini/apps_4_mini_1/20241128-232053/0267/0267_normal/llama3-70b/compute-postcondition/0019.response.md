Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `k` is not equal to 0. If `n` is less than `10 ** k`, then `dp[n, k]` is now equal to `n`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 10` and then taken modulo `MOD`, with `k` being an integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 10.***
