The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it relies on three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. 

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value. Without more details or output specifications, we cannot accurately describe the functionality of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but relies on positive integers a, b, and c (representing lemons, apples, and pears) with 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The return value is unspecified.**
