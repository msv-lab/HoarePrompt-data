Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's how it matches the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. This aligns with the input requirements of the problem description.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be made using the ratio of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The calculation `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly determines the limiting factor among the available fruits based on the required ratios:
   - For each lemon, you need 2 apples, thus `b // 2`.
   - For each lemon, you need 4 pears, thus `c // 4`.
   - The function takes the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` to ensure that it does not exceed the available quantities of any fruit.

3. **Total Fruit Calculation**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`. This correctly computes the total number of fruits based on the number of complete sets derived from the previous step.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits used, which is what the problem requires.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program accounts for scenarios where there are insufficient fruits to make even one complete set (e.g., not enough pears), which would correctly result in `total_fruits` being zero.

Overall, the program adheres perfectly to the problem description and handles all specified cases, including situations when no fruits can be used. Therefore, it is correct.
