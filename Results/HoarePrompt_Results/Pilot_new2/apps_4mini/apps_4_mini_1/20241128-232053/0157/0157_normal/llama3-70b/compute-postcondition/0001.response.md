`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input which will be converted to an integer. The variable `b` can still be a positive integer after the input is provided. The states of `a` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is a positive integer representing the number of pears.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is a positive integer representing the number of pears**.
