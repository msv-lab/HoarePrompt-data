Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Hereâ€™s an explanation of how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three positive integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies that these values will be provided as input.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed based on the required ratio of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. It does this by determining `min_lemon`, which is the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons `a`
   - The number of apples `b` divided by 2 (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon)
   - The number of pears `c` divided by 4 (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon)

3. **Total Calculation**: The program computes the total number of fruits used in the compote as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This formula correctly sums the number of lemons, apples, and pears used based on the number of complete sets that can be formed (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears).

4. **Output**: The final output correctly reflects the total number of fruits used in the compote, which matches the expected output defined in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where not enough fruits are available to make even a single set (e.g., if `min_lemon` is 0, the program will output 0, which is correct).

Overall, the program follows the logic and requirements set out in the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs within the specified range. Therefore, it is correct.
