Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make the compote based on the required 1:2:4 ratio. 

Here's how the program works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
2. It computes the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the constraints given by the number of apples and pears:
   - For every lemon, we need 2 apples, so `b // 2` gives the maximum lemons that can be supported by the apples.
   - For every lemon, we need 4 pears, so `c // 4` gives the maximum lemons that can be supported by the pears.
   - The minimum of these three values (`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`) provides the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) that can be used in the compote.
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote using the formula:
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits, which will be a non-negative integer (including zero if no compote can be made).

The program correctly handles all edge cases as specified in the problem description, including the situation where there are not enough pears or apples to make even one compote.

For example:
- In the case `2, 5, 7`, the output is `7`, which is correct since you can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.
- In the case `4, 7, 13`, the output is `21`, which is correct since you can use 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears.
- In the case `2, 3, 2`, the output is `0`, which is accurate since you cannot make any compote with the available fruits.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement comprehensively.
