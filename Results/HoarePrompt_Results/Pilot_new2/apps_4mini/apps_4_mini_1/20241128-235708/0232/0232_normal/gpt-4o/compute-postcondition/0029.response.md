`left` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `original value of n + 1`. The `current_counts[colors[left]]` value is already reduced by 1 as per the initial state, and since `left` has changed, the index used in `current_counts` will now reflect the color associated with `left` after the increment. The values of `right` and `current_counts` (except the specific count that was reduced) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is equal to `original value of n + 1`, `right` is equal to the original value of `n`, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is reduced by 1 while other counts remain unchanged.**
