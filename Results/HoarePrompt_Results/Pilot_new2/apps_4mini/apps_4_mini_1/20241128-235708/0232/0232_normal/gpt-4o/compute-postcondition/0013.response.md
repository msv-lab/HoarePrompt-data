Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers within their specified ranges, `colors` is a list of integers corresponding to those ranges, `k` is a list of integers with a sum within the limits, and both `desired_counts` and `current_counts` are dictionaries mapping color numbers to their counts. If the counts of all colors in `current_counts` match their respective counts in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES', implying the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
