Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `color` is `colors[2]`; `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or 2. If the counts in `window_counts` match the target counts in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
