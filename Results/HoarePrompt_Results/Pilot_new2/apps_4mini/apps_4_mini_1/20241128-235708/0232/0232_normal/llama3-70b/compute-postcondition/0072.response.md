The variable `color` is assigned the value `colors[j]`. The value of `j` is 2, so `color` becomes `colors[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected, but we must include that `window_counts[color]` has already been incremented by 1 prior to this assignment.

The output state reflects that `color` is now equal to `colors[2]`, while the previous conditions regarding `n`, `i`, `j`, and the incremented `window_counts[color]` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1**.
