The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `color` is `colors[0]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
