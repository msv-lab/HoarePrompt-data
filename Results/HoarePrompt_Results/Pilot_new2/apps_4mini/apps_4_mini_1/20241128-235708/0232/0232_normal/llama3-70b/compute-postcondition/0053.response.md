According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since `i` is initialized to 1 and `n` is an integer in the range of 1 to 100, the loop will execute as long as `j` starts at `i` and is less than `n`. 

Given that `j` is initialized to `n-1`, the loop will not execute if `i` is equal to `n` because the starting value of `j` (which is `n-1`) will be equal to or greater than `n`, preventing any iterations. Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is strictly less than `n`.

At the beginning of the loop, `j` will be equal to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, we can adjust the state to reflect that `i` should be less than `n`. 

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`**
