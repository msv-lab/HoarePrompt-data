The variable `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. Since `color` is `colors[3]`, we can assume that `window_counts[color]` was initially set to 0 (as stated in the initial conditions) since `color` was not previously in `window_counts`. Therefore, after the increment, `window_counts[color]` will have a value of 1.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `color` is `colors[3]`, and `window_counts[color]` is 1.**
