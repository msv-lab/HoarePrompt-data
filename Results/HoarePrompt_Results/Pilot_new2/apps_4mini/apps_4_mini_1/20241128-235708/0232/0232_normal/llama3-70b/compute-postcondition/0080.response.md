Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `j` is `n`; `window_counts` contains the counts of each color in `colors` from index `i` to `n-1`; `found` is True; `color_counts` reflects the original occurrences of colors in `colors`, and the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`.***
