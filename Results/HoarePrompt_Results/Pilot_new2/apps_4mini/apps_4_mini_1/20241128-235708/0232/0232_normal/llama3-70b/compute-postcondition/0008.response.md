The variable `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not already in `color_counts`, it was initialized to 0, and now it becomes 1; if it was already present, it increases by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list that contains at least 1 color, `color` is the first color in the `colors` list, and `color_counts[color]` is increased by 1.
