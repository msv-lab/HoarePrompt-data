The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on several input constraints. It expects an integer `n` such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \) and an integer `m` such that \( 1 \leq m \leq n \). Additionally, it requires a list of `n` integers, where each integer is within the range {1, 2, ..., m}. Finally, it also requires a list of `m` integers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m \) such that \( 1 \leq \sum_{i=1}^{m} k_i \leq n \).

Based on these parameters, the functionality of the function `func` will be determined by the logic implemented within it, which would process these inputs. Given the output constraints, the function may perform validations or computations based on the provided lists and integers.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ n), a list of `n` integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, and a list of `m` integers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m \) such that \( 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_i ≤ n \).**
