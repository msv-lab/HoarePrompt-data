The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `j` is `n-1`; `window_counts` contains the counts of each unique color from the `colors` list; `found` is True; `color_counts` reflects the original occurrences of colors in `colors`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
