Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `color` is `colors[0]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The counts of `window_counts` sorted in ascending order match the `counts` values, indicating that the current state of `window_counts` satisfies the target counts.***
