According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. Additionally, for the loop to still be valid, `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, if `found` is True, then `window_counts` matches the corresponding values in `counts`**.
