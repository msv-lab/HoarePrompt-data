The variable `j` is assigned the value `n - 1`, and `color` is assigned the value from the `colors` list at index `j`. Since `j` is equal to `n - 1`, this means `color` will be the last element of the `colors` list given that `n` must be greater than 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `color` is `colors[n - 1]`.**
