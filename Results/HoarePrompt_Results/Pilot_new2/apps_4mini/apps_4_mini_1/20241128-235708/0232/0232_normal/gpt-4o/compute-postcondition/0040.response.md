Output State: **`left` is equal to `original value of n + k`, where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, `right` is equal to the original value of `n`, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is reduced by `k`, and for all colors in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is equal to or greater than `desired_counts[color]`. If the loop executed at least once, then original value of `n` must have been greater than or equal to 1 since `current_counts[color]` for each `color` must have initially met or exceeded the `desired_counts[color]` for the loop to start. If the desired counts are met for all colors, it will return 'YES'.**
