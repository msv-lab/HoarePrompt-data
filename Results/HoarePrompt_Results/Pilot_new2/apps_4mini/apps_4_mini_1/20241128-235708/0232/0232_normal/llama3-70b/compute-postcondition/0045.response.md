The code `break` indicates that we are exiting from the most internal loop or control structure, but no variables have been changed as a result of this command. Therefore, the output state retains the values of the variables as they were before the break statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `color` is `colors[2]`; `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or 2; `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
