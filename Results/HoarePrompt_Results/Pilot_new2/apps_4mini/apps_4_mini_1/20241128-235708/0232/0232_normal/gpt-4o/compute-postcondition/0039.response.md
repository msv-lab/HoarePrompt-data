The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Initially, `left` is equal to `original value of n + 2`, so after the increment, `left` will be `original value of n + 3`. The values of `right`, `current_counts[colors[left]]`, and `desired_counts[colors[left]]` remain unchanged in this operation. The information about `current_counts[colors[left]]` being one less than before and greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]]` still holds true.

Output State: **`left` is equal to `original value of n + 3`, `right` is equal to `original value of n`, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is now one less than before and greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]]`.**
