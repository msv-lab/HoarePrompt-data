Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and greater than 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `color` is `colors[1]`; `window_counts[color]` is now 1 if it was previously 0 or incremented by 1 if it was already recorded; if the condition checks that all counts match their respective targets, then `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
