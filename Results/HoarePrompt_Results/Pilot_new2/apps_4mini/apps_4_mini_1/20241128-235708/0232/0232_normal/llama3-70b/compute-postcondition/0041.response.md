Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `color` is `colors[2]`; `window_counts[color]` is now 0; if the condition checks that all counts match their respective targets, then `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
