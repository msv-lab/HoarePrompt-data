To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step. 

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i, n)`, which means that `j` starts from `i` and goes up to (but does not include) `n`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is greater than 2, this means `n` is at least 3.
3. The current value of `j` is equal to `i`, which is 1. Therefore, in the current iteration, `j` is 1.
4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to take the next value in the range, which would be `j = 2`.
5. After the current iteration (where `j` was 1), `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 2.
6. To ensure the loop can continue executing, `j` must remain less than `n`, which we have established is greater than 2.

As a result, we need to state the new values of the relevant variables:

- `i` remains 1.
- `j` becomes 2.
- `n` still is greater than 2.
- The other variables (`color`, `window_counts`, `found`) do not need to change because they were not explicitly defined to be altered for the next iteration.

Putting it all together, we can conclude:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1**
