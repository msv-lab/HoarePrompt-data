To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and potential edge cases.

The problem requires us to find the smallest integer `n` from a given string `s` that contains characters of `n` and an integer `k`, which is the count of digits in `n`. Additionally, we have a remembered substring `sub` of `n`.

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Extracting the Length of n**:
   - The code computes the length of `n` as `n_len`, which is the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`. This part seems correct because `s` contains `n` and `k`, and knowing `sub` allows us to determine the remaining characters.

2. **Validating the Number**:
   - The function `is_valid_number(num_str, sub)` checks if `sub` is present in `num_str` and that `num_str` has the correct length (equal to `n_len`). This is a necessary condition.

3. **Generating Permutations**:
   - The program uses permutations of the remaining characters (after accounting for `sub`) to generate possible `n` values. However, generating permutations for a string with potentially 1,000,000 characters is computationally expensive and impractical. Additionally, it does not guarantee that we will find the smallest number efficiently.

4. **Finding the Smallest Number**:
   - Finally, the program tries to find the smallest valid number from the generated permutations, but this approach could be incorrect due to the high computational complexity and the possibility of not generating all valid `n` values effectively.

### Potential Issues:
- The program relies heavily on generating permutations, which could miss valid combinations or lead to inefficiency. For example, if `s` contains many repeated digits, it may not generate every valid combination.
- The check for the smallest number is done after generating possible candidates, which may not always yield the smallest valid number efficiently.

### Example Case:
Consider the input case:
```
s = "0011223344"
sub = "12"
```
- `n_len` would be `10 - 2 = 8`.
- The valid numbers could be `00112233`, `11223300`, etc., but the program may struggle or be inefficient in finding the smallest valid `n`.

### Conclusion:
Due to the reliance on permutations and potential inefficiencies or omissions in generating valid candidates, the program can fail to find the correct smallest number in certain cases.

Thus, the final conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**
