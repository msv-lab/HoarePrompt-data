To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic.

### Problem Summary:
- We need to find the smallest integer n that Vasya could have passed to Kate, given a shuffled string `s` which contains the digits of `n` and the count of its digits appended (k), and a substring `t` of `n` that Vasya remembers.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads two strings: `s` (the shuffled digits) and `t` (the substring).
2. The function `func_1`:
   - Creates a set of characters from `t`.
   - Builds a new string `n` by appending characters from `s` that are present in the set of characters from `t`.
   - Appends `t` to `n`.
   - Finally, it converts `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Missing Leading Zeros Handling**:
   - The problem states that the decimal representation of n contained no leading zeroes, except if n is zero. However, the function does not address how to handle leading zeros properly when constructing the smallest integer n.
   - The way the program is constructed might lead to a situation where leading zeros are included in the constructed integer n. For example, if `s` is "003512" and `t` is "021", it could produce results like "30021", but it could also produce "00321", which is not a valid integer due to leading zeros.

2. **Finding the Smallest n**:
   - The program does not guarantee that the constructed n is the smallest possible integer. It simply appends the substring t to any combination of characters from s that are found in t without considering how to arrange them to minimize n.

### Test Case Demonstration:
1. For input:
   ```
   003512
   021
   ```
   The program could generate:
   - "30021" which is correct.
   - "00321" which is incorrect due to leading zeros.
   
   Thus, the program fails to ensure that n has no leading zeros when t is not "0".

2. Another test case:
   ```
   199966633300
   63
   ```
   Here, the program may produce "3036366999" or "663999300" or other combinations, but we need to ensure that among these, the smallest valid n is constructed.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, we can conclude that the program does not correctly handle the requirements of the problem description, particularly with leading zeros and ensuring the smallest possible integer.

**Correctness: False**
