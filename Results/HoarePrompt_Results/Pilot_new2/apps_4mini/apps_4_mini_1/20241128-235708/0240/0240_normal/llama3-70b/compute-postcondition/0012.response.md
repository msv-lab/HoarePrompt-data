Output State: **`n` is a string containing the characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`, preserving the order of their appearance in `s`. `s` is a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`. If `s` does not contain any characters from `t_set`, then `n` will remain an empty string.**
