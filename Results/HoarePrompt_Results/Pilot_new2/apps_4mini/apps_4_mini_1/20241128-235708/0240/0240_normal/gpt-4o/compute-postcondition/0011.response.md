The `yield` statement produces a value for the caller and pauses the function's execution, allowing it to be resumed later. In this case, `candidate` is yielded, which means it is returned as an output.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the return of `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to the string representation of `perm`, and `candidate` has been yielded.**
