Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to the string representation of `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number in relation to `sub`, then `candidate` has been yielded.***
