Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `chars` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `sub` made up of digits. It generates all possible permutations of `chars` and yields those permutations that are considered valid according to the `is_valid_number` function in relation to `sub`. If no valid permutations are found, the function yields nothing. Note that the function could potentially generate a large number of permutations, which may lead to performance issues if `chars` is very long. **
