The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input `s` consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string moving towards the center. The function prints 'TAK' if `s` is a palindrome and 'NIE' if it is not. There is no explicit return value from the function, and the result is only printed.
