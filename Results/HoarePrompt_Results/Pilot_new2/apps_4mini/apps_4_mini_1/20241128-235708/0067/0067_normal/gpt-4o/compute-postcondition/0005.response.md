Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The current value of `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, meaning that `x + z < y`.***
