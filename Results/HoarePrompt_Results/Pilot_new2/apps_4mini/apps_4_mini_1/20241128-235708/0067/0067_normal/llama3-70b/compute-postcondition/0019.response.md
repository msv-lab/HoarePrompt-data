Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input. It compares these integers and prints '+' if `x` is greater than `y + z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` equals 0, '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, or '?' if `x` is greater than or equal to `y` but not equal to `y`. The function does not have any return value. **
