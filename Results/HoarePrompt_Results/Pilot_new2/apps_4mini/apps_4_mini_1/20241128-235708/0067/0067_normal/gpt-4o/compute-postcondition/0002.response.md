The code `max_upvotes = x + z` assigns the value of `max_upvotes` as the sum of `x` and `z`. Given that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers constrained between 0 and 100, and `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, the value of `max_upvotes` will also remain within the range from 0 to 200. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.**
