The code `print('-')` outputs a string `'-'` to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the action of printing.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `x + z < y`; a string `'-'` has been printed.**
