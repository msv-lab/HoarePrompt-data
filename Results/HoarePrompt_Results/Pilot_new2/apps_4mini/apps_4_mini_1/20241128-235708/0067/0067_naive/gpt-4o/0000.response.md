Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where there are unknown voters (`z > 0`) correctly. Specifically, when `x == y` and `z > 0`, the output should be uncertain, as unknown voters can tip the balance either way. For example, if we have `x = 2`, `y = 2`, and `z = 1`, the possible outcomes would be:

- If the unknown voter upvotes: 3 upvotes and 2 downvotes (result is "+").
- If the unknown voter downvotes: 2 upvotes and 3 downvotes (result is "-").

In this case, the expected output should be "?" to indicate uncertainty, but the provided program will print "?" as it does not check this condition explicitly. 

Thus, the program fails to work correctly for the scenario where `x == y` and `z > 0`.
