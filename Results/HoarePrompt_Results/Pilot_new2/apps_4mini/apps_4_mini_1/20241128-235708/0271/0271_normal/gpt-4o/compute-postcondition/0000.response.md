`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The constraint on `n` remains valid; it is still a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
