The value of `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the last digit of `n`. Given that `n` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the value of `remainder` will be between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`, which is between 0 and 9 (inclusive).**
