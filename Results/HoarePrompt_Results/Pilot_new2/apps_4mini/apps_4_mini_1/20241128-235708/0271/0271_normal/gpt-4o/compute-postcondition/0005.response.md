The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Given that `remainder` is equal to `n % 10` and is greater than 5, it implies that `remainder` can take values from 6 to 9. Therefore, `10 - remainder` will yield values between 4 and 1 (inclusive). 

This means `result` will be calculated as follows:
- If `remainder` is 6, then `result = n + 4`
- If `remainder` is 7, then `result = n + 3`
- If `remainder` is 8, then `result = n + 2`
- If `remainder` is 9, then `result = n + 1`

The states of `n` and `remainder` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`, which is between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and greater than 5; `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`, which is between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and greater than 5; `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`.**
