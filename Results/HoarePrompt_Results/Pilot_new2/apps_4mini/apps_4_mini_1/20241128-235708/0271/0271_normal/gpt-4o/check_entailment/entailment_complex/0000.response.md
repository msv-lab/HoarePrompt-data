To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: A non-negative integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
2. **Rounding Requirement**: The integer `n` must be rounded to the nearest integer that ends in `0`. If `n` already ends in `0`, it remains unchanged.
3. **Examples provided**:
   - For `n = 5`, valid outputs include `0` or `10`.
   - For `n = 113`, the output must be `110`.
   - For `n = 1000000000`, the output must be `1000000000`.
   - For `n = 5432359`, the output must be `5432360`.

### Analysis of the Annotated Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    remainder = n % 10
    if (remainder <= 5) :
        result = n - remainder  # Rounding down to the nearest multiple of 10
    else :
        result = n + (10 - remainder)  # Rounding up to the nearest multiple of 10
    print(result)
```

1. **Remainder Calculation**: The program calculates `remainder` as `n % 10`, which gives the last digit of `n`.
2. **Rounding Logic**:
   - If `remainder <= 5`: The program rounds down by subtracting `remainder` from `n`, effectively giving the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`.
   - If `remainder > 5`: The program rounds up by adding `(10 - remainder)` to `n`, resulting in the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`.

### Correctness Check:
- If `n` ends in `0`, the `remainder` will be `0`, and the output will be `n`, which is correct.
- If `n` ends in `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`, the `remainder` will be less than `5`, and the program will round down to the nearest multiple of `10`, which is correct.
- If `n` ends in `5`, the program rounds down to the nearest multiple of `10`, which is also acceptable as the problem allows rounding to `0` or `10`.
- If `n` ends in `6`, `7`, `8`, or `9`, the program rounds up, which is correct as it reaches the next multiple of `10`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all possible cases correctly according to the problem description, rounding `n` to the nearest integer that ends with `0`.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
