The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not return any specific output as the output is not provided in the description. Therefore, based on the constraints and the lack of output information, we cannot determine the specific functionality of the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are integers with the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific output or return value of the function is not defined.**
