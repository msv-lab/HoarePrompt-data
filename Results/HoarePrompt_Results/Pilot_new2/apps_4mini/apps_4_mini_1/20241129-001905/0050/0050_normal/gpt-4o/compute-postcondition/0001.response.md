The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a space-separated string of integers from the input, splits it into individual string elements, maps each of those strings to integers, and then creates a list of these integers, thus assigning it to `s`. The previous state of `s` is not specified, but it will now contain a new list based on the input.

The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `r` continues to hold its input integer value. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 30; `r` is an input integer; `s` is a list of n integers derived from input; `b` is a list of m integers such that each element b[j] satisfies 1 <= b[j] <= 1000.**
