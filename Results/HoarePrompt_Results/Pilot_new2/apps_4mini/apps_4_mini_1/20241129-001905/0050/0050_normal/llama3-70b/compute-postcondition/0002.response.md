The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created from the input, where the input consists of `m` integers separated by spaces. The states of the other variables remain the same as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `b` now contains the integers provided in the input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `n` integers based on input, where each integer `s_i` is such that 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000, `b` is a list of `m` integers based on input.**
