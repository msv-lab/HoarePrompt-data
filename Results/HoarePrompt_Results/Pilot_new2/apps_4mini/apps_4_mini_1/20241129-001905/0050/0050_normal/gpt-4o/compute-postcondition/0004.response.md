The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from list `b`. The value of `b` consists of `m` integers, each satisfying the condition `1 <= b[j] <= 1000`. Therefore, the value of `max_sell_price` is the largest element in the list `b`, which is a value between 1 and 1000.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 30; `r` is an input integer; `s` is a list of n integers derived from input; `b` is a list of m integers derived from input where each element `b[j]` satisfies 1 <= `b[j]` <= 1000; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 30; `r` is an input integer; `s` is a list of n integers derived from input; `b` is a list of m integers derived from input where each element `b[j]` satisfies 1 <= `b[j]` <= 1000; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`.**
