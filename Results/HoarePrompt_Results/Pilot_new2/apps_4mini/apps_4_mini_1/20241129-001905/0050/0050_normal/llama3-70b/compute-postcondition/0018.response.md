To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

The loop is structured as follows:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This indicates that `i` will take on values starting from 0 up to `n-1`. The loop iterates `n` times, meaning `i` will take on values 0, 1, 2, ..., up to `n-1`.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 30. 
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30.
- The variable `i` was set to 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

Now, to execute the loop one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1. Starting from `i = 1`, the next value of `i` will be 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` after incrementing it:
- If `n` is 2, `i` will be 2, which is not less than `n`.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, then `i` will be less than `n`, and the loop can execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we can summarize the required state adjustments as follows:
- `i` is updated to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 to allow for another iteration.

Finally, we summarize the adjusted states:

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `i` is 2**.
