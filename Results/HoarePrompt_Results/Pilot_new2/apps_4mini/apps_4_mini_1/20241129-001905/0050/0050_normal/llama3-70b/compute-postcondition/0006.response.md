To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. The loop is structured as `for i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute a number of times equal to the value of `n`. 
2. From the state description, `n` is guaranteed to be an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\). Therefore, the loop will execute at least once, which means the loop is set to execute properly since `n` is valid (1 or greater).
3. The loop variable `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1` during the iterations of the loop. Thus, at the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to `0` for the first iteration.

Based on this analysis, the only adjustment needed for the loop to execute is to ensure that `i` starts at `0`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on input, where each integer `s_i` is such that 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000, `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0**
