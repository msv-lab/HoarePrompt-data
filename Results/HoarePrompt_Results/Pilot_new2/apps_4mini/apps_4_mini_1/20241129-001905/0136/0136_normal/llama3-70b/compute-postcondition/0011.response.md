The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than \(10^6\) digits and may include leading zeroes. After processing the inputs, the function returns the sum of the two integers represented as a string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two non-negative integer strings, `a` and `b`, and return their sum as a string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, both non-negative integers represented as strings, and returns their sum as a string.**
