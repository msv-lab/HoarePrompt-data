Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the input integers a and b are both zero or contain only leading zeros. Specifically, the program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros, which can result in an empty string (`""`) when the entire input is zero. This leads to incorrect comparisons since an empty string is not equivalent to the string representation of zero (`"0"`).

For example, if both inputs are `"0000"`, then `lstrip('0')` will return `""` for both a and b. The comparison `if (a == b)` will evaluate to `True` and print `'='`, which is incorrect because it should output `'='` only when comparing their numerical values, including the handling of leading zeros properly.

Furthermore, the program does not consider the case where the input strings have a different number of digits after leading zeros are removed. This could result in incorrect comparisons if a longer string is compared to a shorter one that was originally less than it but had zeros.

Thus, the program fails to fully meet the requirements set forth in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
