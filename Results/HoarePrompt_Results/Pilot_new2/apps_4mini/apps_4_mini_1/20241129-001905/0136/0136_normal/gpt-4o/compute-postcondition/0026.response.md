The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters as input parameters. Instead, it reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` from the input, which are represented as strings. These strings can contain leading zeroes and can be up to \(10^6\) digits long. After executing the function body, it processes these inputs and returns a result based on the operation performed on the integers represented by `a` and `b`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to read two non-negative integers from input as strings, potentially containing leading zeroes, and return a result based on those integers.
