The code snippet simply prints the character '<'. It does not modify any variables or their values. Therefore, the states of the affected variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings, where if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. The current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`.**
