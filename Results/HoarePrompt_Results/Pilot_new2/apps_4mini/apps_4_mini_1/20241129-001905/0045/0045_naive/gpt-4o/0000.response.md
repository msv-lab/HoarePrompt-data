To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1` in detail.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We are tasked with creating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers such that:
  1. Their sum equals `n`.
  2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized.

### Implementation Details:
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The program first calculates the minimum sum required for `k` strictly increasing positive integers, which is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
2. **Checking Feasibility**: If this minimum sum is greater than `n`, the program returns `-1`, indicating it's impossible to form such a sequence.
3. **Finding a Base Value**: The program calculates `d`, which is determined by how many times the minimum sum can fit into `n` (`d = n // min_sum`). The sequence is then initialized by multiplying each index (from 1 to `k`) by `d`.
4. **Distributing Remainder**: If there is any remainder after filling the base sequence, it increments the last elements of the sequence until the remainder is exhausted.

### Potential Edge Case:
Now, I will check for any edge cases where the current implementation might fail:

- Consider the case where `n` is equal to `k` (e.g., `n = 3` and `k = 3`). The minimum sum required is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is greater than `n`. Thus, the function would correctly return `-1`.
- If `n` is just enough to fit `k` integers, for instance, `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum is still `6`, and thus the output should be `-1`. This is also handled correctly by the program.
  
Now, letâ€™s consider an important case:
- **Case with Exact Fit**: If `n = 6` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum is `6`. The program should return `[1, 2, 3]` which is indeed correct. 
- However, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum is `6`. The program would return `[1, 2, 4]`, which is valid since it remains increasing and sums to `7`.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the cases where `n < min_sum` appropriately by returning `-1`. It also correctly constructs sequences when possible. The logic for distributing the remainder is also correct as it ensures the sequence remains strictly increasing.

Given that I couldn't find a specific case where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

This means that the function correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for all tested scenarios.
