#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1 because the current value of min_sum is greater than n.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`.
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \); `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \); `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min_sum \leq n \); `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \); `remainder` is `0`; `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, kd + r] \), where \( r \) is the number of times the loop executed (from `0` to `k`).
    return sequence
    #The program returns the sequence list containing the values [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd + r], where d is equal to n/min_sum and r is the number of times the loop executed from 0 to k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` positive integers. If this sum exceeds `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the base value `d` such that the sequence will be of the form [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd] and distributes any remaining value (`remainder`) evenly across the sequence, incrementing the last elements as needed. Finally, it returns the constructed sequence.
