To analyze the impact of the code on the program, we start with the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{10}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{10}\)
- `min_sum` is equal to \(k \times (k + 1) // 2\) and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`
- `d` is equal to \(n // min_sum\)

The code snippet provided is:
```
remainder = n - d * min_sum
```

1. We calculate the value of `d` using integer division: \(d = n // min_sum\). This gives us the largest integer such that \(d \times min_sum\) is less than or equal to `n`.
2. The `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d \times min_sum`. This represents the leftover part of `n` after subtracting \(d \times min_sum\).

Thus, we can express `remainder` specifically as:
\[
remainder = n - d \times min_sum
\]

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, and `d`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`; `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`; `remainder` is equal to `n - d * min_sum`.**
