According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from `k - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

Since the loop starts at `k - 1`, the next value for `i` in the next iteration will be `k - 2 - 1`, which is `k - 3`.

Additionally, since `i` must be greater than or equal to `0` for the loop to continue executing, `k` must be at least `3` (i.e., `k - 3 >= 0`).

Thus, to allow for one more iteration, the values must be adjusted as follows:
- `k` must be at least `3`.
- `i` will become `k - 3`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \); `k` is a positive integer such that \( k \geq 3 \); `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min_sum \leq n \); `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \); `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, (k-1)d + 1] \); `i` is \( k - 3 \); `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot min_sum - 2 \)**
