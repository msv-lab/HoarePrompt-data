The code modifies the `sequence` list at index `i`, which is \( k - 3 \). The previous value of `sequence[i]` is \( (k - 1)d + 1 \). After incrementing it by 1, the new value becomes \( (k - 1)d + 2 \). The output state retains the values of all other variables unchanged while updating the specific value of the `sequence` at index `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \); `k` is a positive integer such that \( k \geq 3 \); `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min_sum \leq n \); `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \); `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, (k-1)d + 2] \); `i` is \( k - 3 \); `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot min_sum - 2 \).**
