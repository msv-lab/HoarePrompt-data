To analyze the loop's output state after all iterations have executed, we start with the initial state and how the variables change through subsequent iterations.

- Initial State: `a` is a positive integer n representing the sum of the sequence, and `b` is a positive integer k representing the number of elements in the sequence.

The loop code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, where `b` takes the previous value of `a` modulo the previous value of `b`. This operation continues until `b` becomes 0.

After executing the loop:

1. **First Iteration**: `a` becomes the previous value of `b` (`b_prev`), and `b` becomes `a % b`, which is `n % k`.
2. **Subsequent Iterations**: The values of `a` and `b` continue to swap and update until the value of `b` becomes 0. 

The loop will terminate when `b` becomes 0. The value of `a` at this point will be the last non-zero value of `b`. Through the execution, since `a` and `b` are the results of the Euclidean algorithm, the final values will reflect the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`.

Thus:

- After the loop finishes executing:
  - `a` will be equal to the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
  - `b` will be 0, indicating the termination condition has been met.

Output State: **`a` is the GCD of the original values of `n` and `k`, `b` is 0.**
