To analyze the code provided, we start with the initial state where:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \)
- `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min\_sum \leq n \)
- `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min\_sum} \)
- `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot min\_sum \)

The code snippet provided is:
```
sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
```

Step by step analysis:

1. `sequence` is assigned a list comprehension that generates a list based on the variable `d` and the range of `k`.
2. The list comprehension iterates over `i` from `0` to `k-1` (total of `k` elements), and for each element `i`, it computes `d * (i + 1)`.
3. Hence, the resulting `sequence` will contain `k` values: \( d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, kd \).

The values of `d` and `k` are not changed by this operation, but a new list `sequence` is created, which is dependent on `d` and `k`. Given that `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min\_sum} \), we can specify the values in the list.

Therefore, the output state will include the new list `sequence` and retain all previous conditions as they are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \); `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \); `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min\_sum \leq n \); `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \); `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot min_sum \); `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, kd] \).**
