Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. It computes `total_days` as \(2^n\), then calculates the `numerator` as the product of decreasing values starting from `total_days` for `k` iterations and the `denominator` as \(2^{nk}\). Finally, it returns the values of `numerator` and `denominator` reduced modulo \(10^6 + 3\). The function does not handle potential edge cases related to very large integers since Python's integers can handle arbitrary precision, but the potential for performance issues with large `k` is implied without explicit checks.**
