The assignment `A = p_shared` sets the variable `A` equal to the value currently held by `p_shared`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged, so we will only update the state of `A` to reflect this new assignment while maintaining the conditions of other variables.

Output State: **`A` is equal to `p_shared`; the values of other variables remain unchanged.**
