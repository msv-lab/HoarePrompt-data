To determine the correctness of the provided program, we must analyze its logic against the problem statement and the annotations.

### Analysis:

1. **Problem Description**: The program should calculate the probability that at least two of `k` people share a birthday when there are `2^n` possible birthdays. If `k` exceeds `2^n`, the output should be `(1, 1)`, indicating that a shared birthday is guaranteed. The output must be presented as an irreducible fraction `A/B`, where `A` and `B` are coprime, and the final values should be printed modulo `10^6 + 3`.

2. **Function 1** (`func_1`): This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The handling of GCD is appropriate and follows mathematical conventions.

3. **Function 2** (`func_2`):
   - It starts by checking if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If this condition is true, it prints `(1, 1)` as expected. This part of the code is correct.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates the number of ways that `k` people can have unique birthdays. It computes:
     - `numerator = (total_days - i)` for `i` in the range of `k`, which represents the count of ways to choose unique birthdays.
     - `denominator` is computed as `total_days^k`.
   - The probability of shared birthdays is calculated as `p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`, which seems to align with the requirement to find shared birthday probabilities.
   - Finally, the function simplifies the fraction `A/B` using the GCD and prints the result.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- The program takes care of the case when `k` is greater than `2^n`. However, it does not explicitly handle the edge case when `k` is equal to `2^n` (e.g., `n=2`, `k=4`). In this case, the calculation could potentially result in incorrect behavior when computing the shared birthday probability if not handled appropriately.

### Testing Examples:
- For `n=3`, `k=2`: The program outputs `1 8`, which matches expectations.
- For `n=1`, `k=3`: The program outputs `1 1`, which is correct since it's guaranteed that two people will share a birthday.
- For `n=4`, `k=3`: The program outputs `23 128`, which is correct based on combinatorial probability calculations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not effectively handle the scenario where `k == 2^n`, as this may lead to incorrect probability calculations that do not return the expected output as outlined in the problem description. This ambiguity in handling this case leads to uncertainty in the correctness of the overall program.

Thus, since there is at least one condition under which the program does not behave as expected:

Correctness: **False**
