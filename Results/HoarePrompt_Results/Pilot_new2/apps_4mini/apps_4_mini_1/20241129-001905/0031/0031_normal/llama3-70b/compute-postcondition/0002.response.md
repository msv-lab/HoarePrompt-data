The variable `denominator` is assigned the value of `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\); `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\); `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.**
