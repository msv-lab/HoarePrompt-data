The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\). After executing the function body, it calculates a numerator based on \(2^n\) and `k`, and a denominator based on \(nk\) and the minimum of `n` and `nk`. It then returns the values of the numerator and denominator modulo \(10^6 + 3\). 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, and returns the values of numerator and denominator modulo \(10^6 + 3\), where numerator is calculated based on \(2^n\) and k, and denominator is based on \(nk\) and the minimum of \(n\) and \(nk\).**
