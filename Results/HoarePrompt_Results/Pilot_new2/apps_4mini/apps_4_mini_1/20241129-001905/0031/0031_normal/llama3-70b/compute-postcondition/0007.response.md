The variable `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with the result of `total_days - i`. Given that `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\) and `i` is equal to 1, we calculate the expression:

\[
total\_days - i = 2^n - 1
\]

Then, `numerator` is updated as follows:

\[
numerator = numerator \times (total\_days - i) = 2^n \times (2^n - 1) = 2^n \times (2^n - 1)
\]

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is equal to \(2^n \times (2^n - 1)\), `denominator` is equal to \(2^n\), `i` is 1**
