The `denominator` is updated by multiplying it by `total_days`. Given that `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), the new value of `denominator` will be \(2^{2n} \times 2^n\), which simplifies to \(2^{2n + n} = 2^{3n}\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\); `numerator` is equal to \(2^n \times (2^n - 1) \times (2^n - 2)\); `denominator` is \(2^{3n}\); `i` is 2.**
