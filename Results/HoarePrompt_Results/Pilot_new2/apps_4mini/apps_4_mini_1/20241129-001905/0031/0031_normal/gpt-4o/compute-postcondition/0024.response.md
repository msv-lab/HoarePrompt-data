To determine the output state based on the provided initial state and code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `A` is equal to `p_shared`
  - `B` is equal to `p_total`
  - `g` is equal to the result of `func_1(p_shared, p_total)`

In the code snippet, `A` is updated with the operation `A //= g`. The `//=` operator performs an integer division of `A` by `g` and assigns the result back to `A`.

Since:
- `A` starts as `p_shared`
- `g` is the result of `func_1(p_shared, p_total)`, which means `g` is defined based on the values of `p_shared` and `p_total` but its exact value is not provided.

After executing the code:
- The new value of `A` becomes `p_shared // g`.

No other variables (`B` and `g`) are affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state reflecting the updated value of `A` while retaining the original values of `B` and `g` is:

Output State: **`A` is equal to `p_shared // g`, `B` is equal to `p_total`, `g` is equal to the result of `func_1(p_shared, p_total)`**.
