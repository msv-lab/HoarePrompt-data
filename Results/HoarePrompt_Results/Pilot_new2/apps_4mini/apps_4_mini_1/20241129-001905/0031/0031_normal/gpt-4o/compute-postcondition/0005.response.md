`total_days` is assigned the value `1 << n`, which is the same as `2 ** n`. Since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `total_days` is a positive integer that can be very large. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to `2 ** n`.**
