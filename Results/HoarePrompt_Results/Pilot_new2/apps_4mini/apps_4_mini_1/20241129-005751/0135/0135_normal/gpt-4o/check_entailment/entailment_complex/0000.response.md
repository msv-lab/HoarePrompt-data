Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n, k)` correctly implements the requirements described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Constraints:** The function is designed to handle inputs where both `n` and `k` are integers in the range [1, 10^18]. This is explicitly stated in the annotations, confirming that the inputs adhere to the problem constraints.

2. **Distinct Remainders Check:**
   - The first check `if (k >= n): return 'No'` ensures that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function will return 'No'. This is correct because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, some of the remainders will necessarily repeat (specifically, `n % n = 0` and `n % 1 = 0`).
   
3. **Loop to Compute Remainders:**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `k` inclusive, calculating the remainder of `n % i` for each `i`. It uses a set `seen_remainders` to track the remainders that have already been encountered. If a remainder is found more than once (`if remainder in seen_remainders:`), the function correctly returns 'No'.
   - If all remainders are unique after checking all values of `i` from 1 to `k`, the function returns 'Yes'.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:** 
   - The function correctly handles the situation where `k` is equal to or less than `n` by returning 'No' when `k >= n`, preventing unnecessary calculations.
   - It effectively checks for duplicate remainders for the entire range from 1 to `k`, ensuring that the condition of uniqueness is thoroughly verified.

5. **Output Format:** The function also adheres to the output format specified in the problem description, returning the strings 'Yes' or 'No' in a consistent manner.

Overall, the implementation faithfully reflects the logic needed to determine whether all remainders are distinct based on the problem's requirements, handling all potential edge cases.
