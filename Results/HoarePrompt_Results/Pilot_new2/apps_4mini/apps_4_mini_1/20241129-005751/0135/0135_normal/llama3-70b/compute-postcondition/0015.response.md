According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and for the loop to continue executing, `k` must be at least 3 (since `i` would then need to be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute again).

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that k is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now contains `remainder`, and `i` is 3**
