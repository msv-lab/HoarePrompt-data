The statement `seen.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the `seen` set. The previous state indicates that if `remainder` was already in `seen`, the program would have printed 'No' and exited, which means we have to assume that this condition has not been met at this point. Therefore, `remainder` was not previously in `seen`, and now it will be added.

The other variables `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that k is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` now contains `remainder`, and `i` is 2.**
