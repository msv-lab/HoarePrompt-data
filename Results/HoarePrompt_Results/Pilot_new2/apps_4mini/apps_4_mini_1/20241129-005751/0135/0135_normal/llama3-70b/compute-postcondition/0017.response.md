The code `print('No')` outputs the string 'No' but does not change any variable values. Therefore, the state of all variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input integer such that k is greater than or equal to 3; `seen` now contains `n % 3`; `i` is 3; `remainder` is equal to `n % 3; and 'No' is printed.**
