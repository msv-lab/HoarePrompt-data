The `seen_remainders` set is updated to include `remainder`. The previous state indicates that `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen_remainders` previously included `remainder`. Since we are adding `remainder` to `seen_remainders`, the output state needs to reflect the updated contents of `seen_remainders`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is less than `n`; `seen_remainders` includes `0` and `1` (if it previously did not), or remains the same if `remainder` was already present; `i` is 2; `remainder` is either 0 or 1.**
