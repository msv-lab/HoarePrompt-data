Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is less than `n`, `seen_remainders` includes `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the program returns 'No', indicating that the condition for returning a positive answer has not been met.***
