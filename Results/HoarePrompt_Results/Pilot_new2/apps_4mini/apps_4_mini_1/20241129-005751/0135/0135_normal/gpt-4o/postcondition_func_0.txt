The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where both are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^18. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any remainder from the calculations of `n % i` (for `i` from 1 to `k`) is found to be a duplicate, indicating a cycle. If all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where `k` is 0 or negative, which are outside the given constraints.
