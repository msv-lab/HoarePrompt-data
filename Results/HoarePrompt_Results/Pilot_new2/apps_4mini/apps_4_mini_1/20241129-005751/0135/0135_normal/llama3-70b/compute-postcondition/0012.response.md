The execution of the code `exit()` immediately terminates the program. No variables are modified, and no output is generated apart from the termination. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged, but the program stops executing further.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that k is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` still contains `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is now `n % 2; printed output is 'No' and the program has exited.**
