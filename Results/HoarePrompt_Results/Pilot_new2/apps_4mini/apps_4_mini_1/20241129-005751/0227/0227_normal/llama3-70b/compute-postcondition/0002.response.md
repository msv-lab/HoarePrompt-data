The `a.sort()` statement sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `a`, and the distinct integers in `a` will be rearranged. The previous condition of `a` being a list of `n` distinct integers that satisfy `1 <= a_k <= 10^9` still holds true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers that satisfy 1 <= `a_k` <= 10^9.**
