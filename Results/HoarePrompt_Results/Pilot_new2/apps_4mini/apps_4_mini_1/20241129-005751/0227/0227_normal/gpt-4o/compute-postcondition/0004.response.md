According to the code, the loop will execute if the range specified in `range(1, n)` contains at least one integer. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 23\), if \(n\) is 1, the range will be `range(1, 1)`, which does not include any integers. Therefore, for the loop to execute, \(n\) must be greater than 1. 

At the start of the loop, the state of `i` should be initialized to 1 because the loop starts iterating from 1. 

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` is a set containing the integer `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
