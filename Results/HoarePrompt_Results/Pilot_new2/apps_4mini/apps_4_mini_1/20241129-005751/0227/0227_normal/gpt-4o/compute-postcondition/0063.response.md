In the provided code snippet, `assigned.add(a[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the set `assigned`. The variable `i` is mentioned to remain as `n`, which means we are trying to add the last element of the list `a` (as it is sorted and distinct) to `assigned`. 

Here is the breakdown of the output state:

1. `n` remains greater than 2.
2. `a` is still a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. The variable `assigned` now includes the last element of `a` which is `a[n-1]` (the last element when indexed from 0).
4. `can_form` remains False, and since `assigned` was empty before, we do not change its state from being empty.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes elements from `a` and now includes `a[n-1]`, `can_form` remains False.**
