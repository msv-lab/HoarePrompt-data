Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes elements from `a`, `can_form` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, and `x` is the last element of `assigned` checked. If `assigned` is empty, then `can_form` remains False.***
