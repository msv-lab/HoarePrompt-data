Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` is a set containing at least the integer `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is False, indicating that there does not exist an `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`.***
