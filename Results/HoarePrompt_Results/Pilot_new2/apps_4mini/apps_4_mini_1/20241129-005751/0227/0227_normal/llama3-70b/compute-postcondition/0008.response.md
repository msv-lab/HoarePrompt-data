According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop runs for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, which means it executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2, since the loop condition requires `i` to be less than `n`.

Thus, the updated states reflecting this condition will be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 <= `a_k` <= 10^9, if `a[1]` is not equal to `a[0] * 2`, then `m` is updated to 2**
