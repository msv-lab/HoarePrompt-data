The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[n-1]`, `can_form` is `True`, `m` is unchanged, `i` is `n`, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the difference (a[i] - x) is an element of `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
