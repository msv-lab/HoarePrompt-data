Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is updated to 3 and `can_form` remains False. If `can_form` is True, no changes occur.***
