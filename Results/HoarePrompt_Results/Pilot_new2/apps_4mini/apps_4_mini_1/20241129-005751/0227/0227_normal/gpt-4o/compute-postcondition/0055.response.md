According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `assigned`. If `assigned` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute again for the next element in `assigned`. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` has at least 1 element and `x` is the first element of `assigned`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `assigned` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` must be set to the second element of `assigned`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` has at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element of `assigned`.**
