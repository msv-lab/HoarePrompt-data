Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 23, `m` is the count of integers in `a` that do not satisfy the condition `a[i] == a[i - 1] * 2` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`. `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 <= `a_k` <= 10^9. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is 1), `m` remains 1.**
