The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown. The values of `n`, `i`, and `a` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the updated value of `m`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `m` is increased by 1**.
