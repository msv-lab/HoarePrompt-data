To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and identify its logic in relation to the requirements.

### Problem description recap:
1. We have a sequence of distinct positive integers.
2. We need to determine the minimum number of variables `m` that can be used to perform a sequence of operations as described.
3. We need to return `-1` if it's not possible to perform the sequence with any `m`.

### Given Program:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
m = 1
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2:
        m += 1
print(m if m <= 23 else -1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the array `a`. This is a good initial step since it allows for easier comparisons.
2. **Count `m`**: The loop iterates from the second element to the last, checking if each element is not double the previous one. If it isn't, it increases `m` by 1. 
   - The assumption seems to be that if `a[i]` is not equal to `2 * a[i-1]`, then a new variable is needed.
3. **Output**: It checks if `m` exceeds 23 and returns `-1` in that case.

### Potential Issues:
- The program's logic only considers the doubling condition (`a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2`) to count the required variables, which may not cover all necessary cases.
  
#### Example to consider:
For input:
```
5
1 2 3 6 8
```
- This correctly outputs `2` as:
  - `b_1 = 1`
  - `b_2 = b_1 + b_1 = 2`
  - Then several combinations can generate all subsequent numbers correctly.

For input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
- Since `3` and `6` are double, but `5` cannot be formed by any operation from `3` or `6`, it should return `-1`. The program will return `3` as it will increment `m` incorrectly because it only checks for doubling.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle the scenario where a value cannot be formed by any previous values, such as `5` in the second example. Therefore, it lacks comprehensive logic to determine when it is impossible to perform the operations.

Correctness: **False**.
