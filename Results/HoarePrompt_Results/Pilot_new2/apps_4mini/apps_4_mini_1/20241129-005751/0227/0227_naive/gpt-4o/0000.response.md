To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and the operations it performs.

### Problem Description Analysis:
1. We need to determine the minimum number of variables `m` such that a sequence of operations can be performed, starting with assigning `a[1]` to one of the variables.
2. Subsequent operations should assign sums of previously assigned variables to new variables, such that the result matches the elements of the list `a`.
3. If it's not possible to perform the sequence of operations with any `m`, we should return -1.

### Program Logic:
1. The program starts by sorting the input list `a`.
2. It initializes a set `assigned` to keep track of values that have been assigned to variables.
3. It begins the assignment with the first element and increments `m` if the next element cannot be formed by summing any two previously assigned values.

### Examining Potential Cases:
To determine if the program can handle all scenarios:
- The variable `m` represents the number of distinct values needed to create the series of sums to match the values in `a`.
- The logic checks if every subsequent value can be formed by summing two values from the `assigned` set.

### Example Case to Test:
Let's consider the given inputs and expected behaviors:

1. **Input**: `3`, `3, 6, 5`
   - Expected Output: `-1` (since thereâ€™s no combination of previous sums to get `5`).
   - The program should not be able to assign `5` using any combination of the previous values.

2. **Let's create a test case**: 
   - **Input**: `4`, `1, 3, 2, 6`
   - The values `1` and `2` can be assigned to two variables, but `3` cannot be formed by summing `1` and `2` (because we need to assign `3` directly).
   - The output should indicate that at least 3 variables are needed to accommodate all numbers.

### Conclusion:
We can see that the function does not account for cases where a number must be assigned directly because it cannot be formed by summing previously assigned numbers. For instance, if we have to assign `5` or `3` directly without a valid sum formation from previous variables, the logic would fail to increase `m` accordingly.

Therefore, the function does not correctly handle cases where additional variables are necessary to accommodate some direct assignments while ensuring sums match the sequence.

Correctness: **False**.
