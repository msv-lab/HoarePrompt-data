Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), for each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1', `input` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.read` which reads all input data at once.**
