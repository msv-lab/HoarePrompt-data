Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1 appended to it. Otherwise, `results` is updated to include 0, indicating that `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. The variable `count` remains as per the last execution, `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the string value from `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is updated to `index + 3`.***
