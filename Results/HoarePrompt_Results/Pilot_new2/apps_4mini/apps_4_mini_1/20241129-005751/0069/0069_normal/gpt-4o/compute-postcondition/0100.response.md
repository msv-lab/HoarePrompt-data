Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')` and not equal to 0, `results` are as per the last execution, `count` is `1`, `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the string value from `data[index + 2]`, `index` is updated to `index + 3`, and `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`. If the value of `x - b` is divisible by `balance` and `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0, then the count is updated to 1. Otherwise, the count remains 0.***
