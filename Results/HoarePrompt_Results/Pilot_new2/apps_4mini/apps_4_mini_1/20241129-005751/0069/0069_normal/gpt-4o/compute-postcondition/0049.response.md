According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to `prefix_balances[0] + (1 if s[1] == '0' else -1)`**
