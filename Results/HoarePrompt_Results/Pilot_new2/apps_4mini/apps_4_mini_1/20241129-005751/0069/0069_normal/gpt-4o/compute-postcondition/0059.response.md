Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[n]` equals `balance`, `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, the current value of `balance` is 0, if `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1. Otherwise, if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` has an additional value of `0.***
