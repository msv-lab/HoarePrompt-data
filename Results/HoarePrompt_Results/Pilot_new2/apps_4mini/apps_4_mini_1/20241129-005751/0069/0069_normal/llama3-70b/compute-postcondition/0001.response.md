According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. Since `T` is a positive integer and the loop will iterate `T` times, it is necessary that `T` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. At the end of the last iteration, there is no specific variable being altered within the loop declaration that requires adjustment. Thus, to ensure the loop will execute correctly, we need to confirm that `T` remains within its defined range.

State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`, the loop will execute `T` times.**
