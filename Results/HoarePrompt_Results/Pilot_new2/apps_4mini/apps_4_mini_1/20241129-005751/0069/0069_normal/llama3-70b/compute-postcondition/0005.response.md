The value of `balance` is calculated as the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. Since `cnt0` is the count of '0's in the string `s` and `cnt1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `balance` will be equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`.**
