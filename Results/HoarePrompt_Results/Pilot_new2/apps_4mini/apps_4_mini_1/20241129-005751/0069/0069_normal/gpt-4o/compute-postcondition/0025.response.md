Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the balance of '0's minus '1's from the first i characters of the string `s`. The value of `balance` is not equal to 0.***
