The variables `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input provided, which is expected to be two integers. The variable `T` specifies that the loop will execute `T` times, but the code snippet is only for reading the input without affecting the loop execution count directly. The previous conditions of `T` remain valid. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.
