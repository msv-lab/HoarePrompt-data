The variable `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. The previous value of `i` is 3, so we will calculate `prefix_balances[3]` based on the value of `prefix_balances[2]` and the character `s[2]`. The previous values are:
- `prefix_balances[3]` is equal to `prefix_balances[2] + (1 if s[2] == '0' else -1)`.
- `prefix_balances[2]` is already defined as `prefix_balances[2] + (1 if s[2] == '0' else -1)`.

Therefore, the impact is that `prefix_balances[3]` will now hold the value derived from the existing `prefix_balances[2]`, adjusted by either +1 or -1 based on the character at `s[2]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[3]` is equal to `prefix_balances[2] + (1 if s[2] == '0' else -1)**
