According to the code, the loop executes as long as there are characters in the `votes` string to process. The variable `i` refers to the index of the last processed character, which is currently less than `n - 1`. As the loop proceeds, `i` will be incremented, allowing the loop to process the next character in the `votes` string.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the last processed character, and `v` is the next character in `votes` corresponding to index `i + 1`. Since `i` is less than `n - 1`, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`, and the next character `v` will be the character at index `i + 1`.

Thus, we need to ensure that after modifying the state for the next iteration, `i` will equal `i + 1`, and `v` will correspond to that new `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is now `i + 1`, and `v` is the character in `votes` at index `i + 1`.**
