Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` may be empty or not, `d_queue` may contain re-added indices based on their relationships with indices from `r_queue`, `r_queue` may contain re-added indices based on their relationships with indices from `d_queue`, and the final state of `d_index` and `r_index` will be the last values removed from their respective queues.***
