The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` must contain at least one index, after this operation, `d_queue` will have one less element. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`d_queue` contains at least one less index, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`.**
