The value of `remocrats` is increased by 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `fraction` is the second character in the string, `depublicans` is increased by 1 if the first character is 'D', otherwise `remocrats` is increased by 1 and `remocrats` is now incremented by 1.
