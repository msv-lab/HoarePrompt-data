Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is the index of the last processed character (which must be less than `n` - 1); `v` is the next character in `votes` corresponding to index `i + 1`. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` has the value `i` appended to it. Otherwise, `r_queue` now includes the value `i`.***
