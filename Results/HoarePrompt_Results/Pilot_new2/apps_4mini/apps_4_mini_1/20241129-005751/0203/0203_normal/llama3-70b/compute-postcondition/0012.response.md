The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `fractions` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters, and `remocrats` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters, `remocrats` has been increased by 1**.
