The value of `r_index` is added to `n`, and the result is appended to `r_queue`. Since `r_index` is now the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, the state of `r_queue` changes to include one new value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`d_queue` contains at least one less index, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is now the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, `r_queue` now contains one additional element which is `r_index + n`.**
