Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is empty, or `r_queue` is empty, `d_queue` may contain re-added indices from `d_queue` based on their relationships with indices from `r_queue`, while `r_queue` may contain re-added indices from `r_queue` based on their relationships with indices from `d_queue`. The final state of `d_index` and `r_index` will be the last values removed from `r_queue`, since `d_queue` is not entered.***
