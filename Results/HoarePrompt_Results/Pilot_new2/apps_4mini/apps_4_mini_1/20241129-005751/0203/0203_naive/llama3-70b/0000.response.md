Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the voting logic as described in the problem statement. The problem states that employees can deny each other the right to vote, which would affect the outcome of the election based on the order of statements made. However, the program simply counts the number of 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats) characters without considering any interactions between the employees or the implications of denying votes.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
5
RDRDR
```

In this scenario:
1. Employee 1 ('R') can deny Employee 2 ('D').
2. Employee 2 ('D') can deny Employee 1 ('R') in the next round.
3. The sequence continues with the possibility of denying each other based on their turns.

In this case, the winner cannot simply be determined by counting the factions, as the actual statements and actions of denying votes affect who ultimately remains eligible to vote, which the current program does not account for.

Thus, the program's logic fails to handle the voting process correctly, leading to an incorrect prediction of the outcome.
