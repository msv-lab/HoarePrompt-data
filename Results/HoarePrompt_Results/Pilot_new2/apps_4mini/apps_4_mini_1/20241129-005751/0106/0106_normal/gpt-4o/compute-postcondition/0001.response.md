The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. Since `apartment` can represent either `a` or `b`, we can express `floor_within_block` in terms of either variable. The conditions state that `a` and `b` are both within the bounds of the total number of apartments, and thus they can be used interchangeably for this calculation.

Because `floor_within_block` depends on the specific value of `apartment`, the output will specify that `floor_within_block` is calculated based on either `a` or `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers with 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block` is either `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` or `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)` where `apartment` is either `a` or `b`.**
