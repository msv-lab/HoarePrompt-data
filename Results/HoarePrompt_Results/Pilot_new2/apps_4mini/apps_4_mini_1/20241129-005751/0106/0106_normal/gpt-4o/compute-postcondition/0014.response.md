Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, `k` (each between 1 and 1000) and two integers `a`, `b` (each between 1 and `n·m·k` and not equal to each other). It calculates the total time required to exit from location `a` to location `b` based on the floor of `a`, the walking distances between blocks using both direct and reverse paths, and the time to reach the target floor of `b`. The function returns the total time as an integer.**
