To simulate the execution of the provided code snippet, we will analyze its impact step by step.

1. The variable `reverse_walk_time` is assigned the value of `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
2. The values of `block_a` and `block_b` would have been determined from the function `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)`, respectively.
3. The variable `abs(block_a - block_b)` calculates the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`.
4. The expression `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n` computes the modulo with `n`, which has the effect of ensuring that the result is non-negative and within the range of 0 to n-1.
5. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 15 to obtain the value for `reverse_walk_time`.

Given that we are only concerned with updating `reverse_walk_time`, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `n·m·k`; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are updated with values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are updated with values from `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is equal to `10 + (floor_a - 1)`; `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is equal to `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.**
