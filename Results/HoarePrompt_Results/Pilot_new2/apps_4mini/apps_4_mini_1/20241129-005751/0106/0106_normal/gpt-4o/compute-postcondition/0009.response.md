To determine the output state, we need to analyze the effect of the provided code on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000.
   - `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `n·m·k`.
   - `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`.
   - `block_a` and `floor_a` are updated with values from `get_location(a)`.
   - `block_b` and `floor_b` are updated with values from `get_location(b)`.
   - If `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is equal to `10 + (floor_a - 1)`.
   - `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
   - `reverse_walk_time` is equal to `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)`

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code calculates `min_walk_time` as the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
   - The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are derived from the current values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`.

4. **Output State:**
   - The output state will include all relevant variables and their updated values:
   - `n`, `m`, `k` remain unchanged.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
   - `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, and `reverse_walk_time` are unchanged since they were defined before this code but are necessary for calculating `min_walk_time`.
   - `min_walk_time` is now defined as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `n·m·k`; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are updated with values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are updated with values from `get_location(b)`; `time_to_exit` is either 0 or `10 + (floor_a - 1)`; `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is equal to `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is equal to `min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)`**.
