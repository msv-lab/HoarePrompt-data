To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the description, we will analyze the code and the problem statement step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
The problem describes a round apartment building with specific rules for moving between apartments. Edward and Natasha live in different apartments, and Edward needs to compute the minimum time it takes to reach Natasha's apartment considering the time taken for stairs, lifts, and moving between entrances.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**:
   - This function computes which block and floor an apartment is located in.
   - It uses the formulas:
     - `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
     - `floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)`
     - `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`
   - This logic appears correct as it derives the block and floor based on the apartment number.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - It first retrieves the locations of apartments `a` and `b` using `get_location`.
   - It calculates the time to exit the current block (including lift usage if the apartment is not on the first floor).
   - It calculates the walking time in both directions (direct and reverse) between blocks.
   - Finally, it calculates the time to reach the target floor.

### Edge Case Analysis:
- The function correctly handles scenarios where:
  - Edward is on the first floor (immediate exit).
  - Computes the time for both direct and reverse walking paths around the building.
  
- However, it does not appear to handle cases where:
  - The input apartments `a` and `b` could be on the same floor.
  - If `a` is on the first floor initially, the lift usage might be unnecessary since Edward can walk out immediately.
  
### Output Hints Review:
The output hints indicate that the function calculates total time based on the parameters provided. The hints also suggest that the function does not handle scenarios where the apartment number exceeds the total number of apartments or invalid input checks.

### Conclusion:
The code does not seem to account for certain edge cases adequately. For example, if Edward starts on the first floor and needs to go to the same block without needing the lift, or how the function handles input validation is not addressed. This could lead to incorrect results in specific situations, especially when `a` and `b` are in close proximity.

Therefore, based on this analysis:

Correctness: **False**.

#### Reason:
The program does not correctly account for all potential cases, especially when considering input validation or scenarios where both apartments are on the same floor, which may lead to unnecessary lift usage or incorrect time calculations.
