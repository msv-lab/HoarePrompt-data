To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze whether the implementation accurately computes the minimum time it takes for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment given the constraints outlined in the problem.

### Key Elements of the Problem:
1. **Apartment Layout**: The house consists of `n` blocks (entrances), each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments. Apartments are numbered sequentially.
2. **Travel Time**: 
   - Moving between floors via stairs takes 5 seconds per floor.
   - Moving between entrances takes 15 seconds per entrance.
   - The elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor to travel.
3. **Initial Conditions**: Edward can only exit from the first floor of his block.

### Code Functionality:
1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**: This function computes the block and floor number for a given apartment number.
   - It correctly calculates the block as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
   - It calculates the floor using the formula `floor_within_block // k + 1`, which is consistent with how floors are structured.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**: This function computes the time taken for Edward to travel from his apartment `a` to Natasha's apartment `b`.
   - **Time to Exit**: If Edward is on the first floor, no time is spent; otherwise, it accounts for elevator wait time and the time taken to descend to the first floor.
   - **Walking Time**: 
     - It calculates the direct and reverse walking times to Natasha's block and selects the minimum.
     - The walking time correctly uses the formula `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, which accounts for circular navigation between blocks.
   - **Time to Target Floor**: This is calculated correctly as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, which accounts for the stairs taken from the first floor of Natasha's block to her floor.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic outlined in the problem statement, including all the necessary calculations for determining travel times based on the rules provided. 

It accounts for all possible cases:
- When Edward is already on the first floor.
- When he must take the elevator.
- It calculates both clockwise and counterclockwise travel times correctly.
- It ensures all transitions between floors and blocks conform to the specified time constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program adheres to the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
