Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to the number of elements processed from the `colors` list plus 2, `right` is 1, and `current_counts[color]` is greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]` for at least one color in `desired_counts`. If `current_counts[color]` matches `desired_counts[color]` for all colors in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no return statement in the else part.***
