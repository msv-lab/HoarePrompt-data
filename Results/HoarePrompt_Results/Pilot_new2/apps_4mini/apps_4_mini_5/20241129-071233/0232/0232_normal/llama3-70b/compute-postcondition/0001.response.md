The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values (which are split by spaces) to integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, and `m` is an integer in the range 1 to `n`. The new variable `colors` will now hold a list of integers, but the specific values are not known since they depend on the input provided.

The output state will reflect that `colors` is now a list of integers derived from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers based on input values.**
