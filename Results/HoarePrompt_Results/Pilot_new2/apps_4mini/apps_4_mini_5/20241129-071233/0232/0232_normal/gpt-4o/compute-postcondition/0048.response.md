Output State: **`left` is equal to the number of elements processed from the `colors` list plus the number of elements in `colors` that satisfy the desired counts, and it is still not the case that `current_counts[color]` is equal to `desired_counts[color]` for all colors in `desired_counts`; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1, and `left` is incremented by 1.**
