Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each unique color from `colors` is a key with the corresponding count of occurrences in the `colors` list, `found` remains `True`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is 0.***
