The statement `color_counts[color] += 1` increments the count of the specified `color` in the `color_counts` dictionary. If `color` is not already present in `color_counts`, it implies that the precondition has ensured `color_counts[color]` is set to 0 before this operation. Therefore, the value of `color_counts[color]` will be increased by 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the output state reflects the increment in the `color_counts` for the specified `color`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers that contains at least 1 color, `color_counts[color]` is now 1 greater than its previous value**.
