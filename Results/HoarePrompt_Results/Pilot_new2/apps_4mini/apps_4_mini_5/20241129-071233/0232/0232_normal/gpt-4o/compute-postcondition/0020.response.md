The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is unknown, but it will now be one greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected, including `n`, `m`, `colors`, `k`, `desired_counts`, and `current_counts`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of n integers ranging from 1 to m; `k` is a list of m integers with 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n; `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from integers 1 to m to the corresponding values in k; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1; `left` is increased by 1**.
