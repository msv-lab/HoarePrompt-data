The execution of `break` does not change any variable values, but it will stop the most internal loop or conditional block in which it is placed. Thus, while the values of `n`, `m`, `colors`, `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `j`, and `window_counts` remain unchanged, we note that the execution flow is interrupted.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors; `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences; `found` is True; `i` is less than `n`; `j` is equal to `n`; `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of the colors from `colors` starting at index `i` up to `n-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
