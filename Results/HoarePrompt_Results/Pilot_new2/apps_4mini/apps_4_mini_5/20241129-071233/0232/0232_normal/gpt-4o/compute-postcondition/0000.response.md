The `desired_counts` variable is created as a dictionary that maps each integer in the range from 1 to `m` to the corresponding element in the list `k`. Given the constraints on `k`, it is clear that the sum of the elements in `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and each integer in `k` represents the desired count of colors.

The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state must reflect the new value of `desired_counts`, which is a dictionary mapping from the range of colors (1 to `m`) to the counts specified in `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from each integer in the range 1 to m to the corresponding values in k.**
