The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each unique color from `colors` is a key and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list, `found` is still `True`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `color` is `colors[1]`, and `window_counts[color]` remains either 1 or `window_counts[color] + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
