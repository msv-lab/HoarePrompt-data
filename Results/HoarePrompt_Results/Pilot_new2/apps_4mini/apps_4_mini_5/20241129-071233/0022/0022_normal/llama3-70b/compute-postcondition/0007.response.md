Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not equal the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_palindrome` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
