Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 1 with the first character of `s` equal to the last character of `s`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. If `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, no value is returned from the function.***
