The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Since `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`, it ensures that `remainder` is a value between 0 and 9 inclusive, and the current value of `remainder` is less than or equal to 5. Therefore, `result` will be the value of `n` reduced by a non-negative integer value (which can range from 0 to 5).

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`, where `remainder` is between 0 and 9 inclusive and is less than or equal to 5; `result` is equal to `n - remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`, where `remainder` is between 0 and 9 inclusive and is less than or equal to 5; `result` is equal to `n - remainder`.**
