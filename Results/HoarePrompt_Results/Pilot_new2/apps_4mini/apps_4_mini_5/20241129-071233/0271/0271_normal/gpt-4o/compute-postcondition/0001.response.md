The value of `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, the value of `remainder` will be between 0 and 9, inclusive. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`, where `remainder` is between 0 and 9 inclusive.**
