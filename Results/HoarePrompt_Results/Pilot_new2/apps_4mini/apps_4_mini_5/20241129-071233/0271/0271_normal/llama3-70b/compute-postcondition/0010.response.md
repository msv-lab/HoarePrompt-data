The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the assumption that it works with a non-negative integer `n` constrained by the condition 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Since there are no output specifications provided in the prompt, we cannot detail the return values or any specific behavior of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function is as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is designed to operate within the constraints of a non-negative integer n, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
