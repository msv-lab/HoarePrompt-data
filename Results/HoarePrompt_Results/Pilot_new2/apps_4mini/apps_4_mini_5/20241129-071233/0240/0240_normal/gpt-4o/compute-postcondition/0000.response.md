According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `chars`. The `permutations` function will generate permutations of the string `chars`. If `chars` is a string containing digits, it is important for it to have at least one character (which is given since it can have a length not exceeding 1,000,000). 

However, for the loop to execute, the condition is already satisfied since `chars` is stated to contain digits. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `perm` will hold the current permutation of `chars`. Thus, there are no specific adjustments required to the state of `chars` itself, but we can note that `perm` will start as the first permutation of `chars` when the loop begins.

State: **`chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
