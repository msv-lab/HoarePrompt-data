The variable `n` is updated by appending the character `c` to its current value. Since `n` starts as an empty string, `n` will now be equal to the single character `c`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, `n` is now equal to `c`, and `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, `n` is equal to `c`, `c` is the next character in `s` that must be processed**.
