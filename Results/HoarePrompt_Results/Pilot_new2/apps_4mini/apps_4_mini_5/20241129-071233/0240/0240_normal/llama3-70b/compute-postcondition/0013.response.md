The variable `n` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with `t`. Since `n` is formed from characters in `s` that are present in `t_set`, and `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, the concatenation means that `n` will now include the characters from `t` added to whatever characters are already in `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, and `n` is now the original `n` concatenated with `t`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, `n` is the original `n` concatenated with `t`.**
