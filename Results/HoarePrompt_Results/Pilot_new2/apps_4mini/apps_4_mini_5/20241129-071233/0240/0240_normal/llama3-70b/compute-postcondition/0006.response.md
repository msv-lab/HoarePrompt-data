According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters remaining in `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `s` is a non-empty string of digits and `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, indicating there are still characters to process. 

Since `c` is the current character being processed from `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` will take on the next character of `s`. If the length of `s` is greater than the current index of `c`, there will be a next character for `c` to take.

The state requires us to adjust the value of `c` for the next iteration. Therefore, assuming `c` is currently the last character in `s`, it would need to be incremented to the next character index. 

If `c` is currently the last character in `s` (which would make the next iteration invalid), `s` should still remain the same, and the value of `n` would depend on the character `c` and whether it is in `t_set`. However, since we are not given the index or any specific current character `c`, we will denote it simply as the next character.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` is the next character in `s` that must be processed**.
