Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, and `n` is an empty string. If the current value of `c` is an element of `t_set`, then `n` is set to `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains an empty string.***
