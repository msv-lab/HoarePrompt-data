The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. Parameter `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, representing a shuffled number received by Kate. Parameter `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that can contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it returns the integer value of `n`, which is the original number concatenated with the substring `t` from the string of digits `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string of digits `s` and a non-empty substring `t`, and return the integer value formed by concatenating `n` and `t`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string of digits s and a non-empty substring t, returning the integer value of n, which is the original number concatenated with substring t from string s.**
