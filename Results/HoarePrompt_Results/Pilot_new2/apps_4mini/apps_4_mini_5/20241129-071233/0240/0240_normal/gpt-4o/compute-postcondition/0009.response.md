According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `chars` variable and how many permutations can be generated from it. 

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`. If the loop is to execute one more time, there must be another permutation available. The `permutations` function generates all permutations of `chars`, so if `perm` is currently the last permutation, then there will be no more permutations left.

Since we are interested in the next state where the loop is about to execute, we simply need to acknowledge that `perm` will take the next permutation value. However, because `perm` is already the next permutation of `chars` at the end of the last iteration, we don't need to adjust `chars` itself.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `perm` must point to the next permutation of `chars`, and we need to ensure that `candidate` is formed from this new `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`**
