To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: 
   - A string `s` which is a shuffled combination of the number `n` and the integer `k` (the number of digits in `n`).
   - A string `t` which is a substring of `n`.

2. **Output**: 
   - The smallest possible integer `n` that Vasya could have passed to Kate.

### Analysis of the Program
The function `func_1` does the following:
- It creates a set of characters from the substring `t`.
- It then iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- If the character from `s` exists in the set created from `t`, it appends it to the string `n`.
- Finally, it appends `t` to `n` and converts it to an integer before returning it.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Leading Zeroes**: 
   - The code does not account for the need to avoid leading zeroes when forming `n`. If `s` contains leading zeroes and the first character chosen from `s` happens to be zero, the resultant integer `n` will be incorrect unless `n` is actually zero.
  
2. **Smallest possible integer**: 
   - The program does not ensure that the constructed number `n` is the smallest possible integer. For instance, if `s` is "003512" and `t` is "021", the program will generate "30021", which is valid, but it is not guaranteed to be the smallest formation of `n` possible. A more optimal approach would involve a more sophisticated method for arranging the digits in `s` and `t`.

### Counterexample
To illustrate why the program is incorrect due to the issues identified:
- Let's take the input:
  ```
  s = "003512"
  t = "021"
  ```
  
- The expected output should be "1023", as this is the smallest possible integer n which can be formed with the digits in `s` and includes `t` as a substring. However, the program produces "30021" instead, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Given the identified shortcomings in the logic regarding leading zeroes and not producing the smallest integer n, I conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
