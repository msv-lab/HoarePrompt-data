To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

The goal is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` based on the string `s` received by Kate and the remembered substring `sub` of `n`. 

Let's examine the code step by step:

1. **Length Calculation**:
   ```python
   n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
   ```
   This correctly calculates the length of `n` by subtracting the length of `sub` from the length of `s`.

2. **Validation Function**:
   ```python
   def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
       return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
   ```
   This function checks if `sub` is a substring of a candidate number and if the candidate's length matches `n_len`. This is appropriate.

3. **Generating Permutations**:
   The function `generate_possible_numbers` generates all permutations of the remaining characters from `s` after removing the characters from `sub`. This might be computationally expensive, especially since `s` can have up to 1,000,000 characters and the permutations of even a small subset can be very large.

4. **Counting Characters**:
   ```python
   from collections import Counter
   s_counter = Counter(s)
   sub_counter = Counter(sub)
   for char in sub_counter:
       s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
   ```
   This correctly counts the characters in `s` and subtracts the counts of characters used in `sub`.

5. **Constructing Remaining Characters**:
   ```python
   remaining_chars = ''.join([char * s_counter[char] for char in s_counter])
   ```
   This reconstructs the remaining characters that can be used to form potential candidates for `n`.

6. **Finding the Smallest Valid Number**:
   ```python
   smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
   ```
   This line aims to find the smallest number from the valid candidates.

### Potential Edge Cases

- **Leading Zeros**: The program does not appear to handle leading zeros correctly. The output should not have leading zeros unless the number is zero itself. For instance, if `s = "000123"` and `sub = "01"`, the valid reconstruction could theoretically include "0123", which is invalid.
  
- **High Computational Cost**: The use of `permutations` will lead to a significant performance issue with large inputs, which makes it impractical. 

### Conclusion

Given the potential for invalid outputs (due to leading zeros) and the performance concerns with large inputs, the program does not adhere strictly to the requirements of the problem description. 

Thus, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where leading zeros are generated inappropriately, making it incorrect in those scenarios.
