Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown voting intentions, respectively. It checks if the maximum possible upvotes (x + z) is less than the minimum downvotes (y), in which case it prints '-' indicating a clear loss. If the maximum possible downvotes (y + z) is less than the minimum upvotes (x), it prints '+' indicating a clear win. If neither condition is met, it prints '?' indicating uncertainty. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results based on the comparisons. **
