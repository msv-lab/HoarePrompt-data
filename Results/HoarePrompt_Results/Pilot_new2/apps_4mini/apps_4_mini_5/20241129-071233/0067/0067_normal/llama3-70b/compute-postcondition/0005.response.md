The code executes a print statement that outputs a string '-', but it does not modify any variables. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding their bounds and relationships also stay valid.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and the current value of `x` is less than `y`.**
