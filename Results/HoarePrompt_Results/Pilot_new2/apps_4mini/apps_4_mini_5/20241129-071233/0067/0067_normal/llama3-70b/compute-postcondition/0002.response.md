The `print('+')` statement outputs the string `'+'`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged; they still satisfy the condition `0 <= x, y, z <= 100` and `x > y + z`. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. The current value of `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x > y + z`). Output is '+'**.
