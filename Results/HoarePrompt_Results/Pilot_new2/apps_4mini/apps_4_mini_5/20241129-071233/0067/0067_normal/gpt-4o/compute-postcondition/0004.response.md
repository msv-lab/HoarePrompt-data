The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The variable `y` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100], and `z` is also an integer input from the user in the same range. Therefore, `max_downvotes` will be a value between `0 + 0` (if both `y` and `z` are at their minimum) and `100 + 100` (if both are at their maximum), making `max_downvotes` range from `0` to `200`. 

The other variables remain unchanged in their definitions, so the output state retains the previous information for `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]; `y` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]; `z` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
