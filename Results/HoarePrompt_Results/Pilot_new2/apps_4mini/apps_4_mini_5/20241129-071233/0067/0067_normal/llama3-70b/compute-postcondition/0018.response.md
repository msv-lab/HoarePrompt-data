The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with three predefined integers: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained to be within the range of 0 to 100 inclusive. The function's output logic is not provided, hence we cannot specify the return value or the conditions under which it returns specific results. Therefore, without the output logic, we cannot determine the exact functionality of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates with three integers x, y, and z, constrained between 0 and 100.**
