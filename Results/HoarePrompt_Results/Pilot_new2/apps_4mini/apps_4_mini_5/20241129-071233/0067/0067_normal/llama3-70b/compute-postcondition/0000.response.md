The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned based on the input provided. The exact values of `x`, `y`, and `z` would depend on the input but they will remain integers within the range of 0 to 100, as specified by the initial state. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and `x`, `y`, `z` are assigned the values from the input.**
