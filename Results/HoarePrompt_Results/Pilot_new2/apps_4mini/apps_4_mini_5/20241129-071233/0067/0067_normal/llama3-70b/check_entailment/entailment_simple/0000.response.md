To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze how the program behaves in relation to the specifications outlined.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. Given three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, determine the voting result based on:
   - If upvotes (`x`) are greater than downvotes (`y`), return "+".
   - If downvotes (`y`) are greater than upvotes (`x`), return "-".
   - If upvotes and downvotes are equal:
     - If there are no unknown votes (`z = 0`), return "0".
     - If there are unknown votes (`z > 0`), return "?" (since the outcome depends on how unknown votes are distributed).
2. If there is only one definitive result, print that result; otherwise, print "?" indicating uncertainty.

### Program Analysis:
The annotated program proceeds as follows:
1. It reads integers `x`, `y`, and `z`.
2. It checks if `x` is greater than `y + z`:
   - If true, it prints "+" (this means even with all unknowns being downvotes, upvotes are still greater).
3. If `x` is not greater than `y + z`, it checks if `x` is less than `y`:
   - If true, it prints "-" (meaning downvotes exceed upvotes, regardless of unknowns).
4. If `x` is equal to `y`, it further checks:
   - If `z` is 0, it prints "0" (indicating a tie with no unknowns).
   - If `z` is greater than 0, it prints "?" (indicating uncertainty).
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to printing "?" (which occurs if `x` is not equal to `y`).

### Testing Against Problem Cases:
- **Case 1:** Input `3 7 0`
  - Output: "-" (correct, since `3 < 7`)
- **Case 2:** Input `2 0 1`
  - Output: "+" (correct, since `2 > 0` regardless of one unknown)
- **Case 3:** Input `1 1 0`
  - Output: "0" (correct, as `1 == 1` and `z = 0`)
- **Case 4:** Input `0 0 1`
  - Output: "?" (correct, as `0 == 0` but we have one unknown)

The program correctly identifies and handles each possible scenario based on the value of `x`, `y`, and `z`, thus aligning with the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the program thoroughly checks all conditions laid out in the problem description and produces the expected output for every case, we can conclude that it meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
