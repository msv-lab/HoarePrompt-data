The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 0 and `s[i] - 1`, `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[i])`, and `i` is equal to 1. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 0 and `s[i] - 1`, `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[i])`, and `i` is equal to 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
