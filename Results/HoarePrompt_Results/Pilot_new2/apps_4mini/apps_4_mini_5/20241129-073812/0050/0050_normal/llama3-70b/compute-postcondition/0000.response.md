The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned based on the input provided. The previous states of these variables were unknown before this assignment, but they are guaranteed to be integers within the specified ranges. After executing the code, `n`, `m`, and `r` will take on the values provided by the user input. The other variables (`s` and `b`) remain unaffected by this particular code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 30; `m` is an integer within the range 1 to 30; `r` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000; `s` is a list of `n` integers where each element s[i] (1 <= s[i] <= 1000); `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element b[j] (1 <= b[j] <= 1000).**
