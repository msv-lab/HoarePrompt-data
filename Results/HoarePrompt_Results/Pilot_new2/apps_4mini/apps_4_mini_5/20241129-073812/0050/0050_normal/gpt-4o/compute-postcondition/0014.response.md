Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, where `n` is the number of buying prices, `m` is the number of selling prices, and `r` is the amount of money available. It also takes two lists: `s` containing `n` buying prices and `b` containing `m` selling prices. It computes the minimum buying price and the maximum selling price. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` at the minimum buying price, computes the remaining money after buying shares, and then calculates the total amount of money if all shares were sold at the maximum selling price plus the remaining money. Finally, it prints the total amount of money. The function does not handle cases where `n`, `m`, or `r` are outside the specified bounds, nor does it validate the content of the lists `s` and `b` for the given constraints. **
