The variable `b` is assigned a list of integers created by mapping the input values (after splitting them into separate strings) to integers. The input values are expected to be within the range of 1 to 1000, and since `m` is within the range 1 to 30, the resulting list `b` will contain exactly `m` integers, all of which must also be within the range 1 to 1000. The values of `n`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 30; `m` is an integer within the range 1 to 30; `r` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000; `s` is a list of `n` integers which are the user inputs within the range 1 to 1000; `b` is a list of `m` integers which are the user inputs within the range 1 to 1000.**
