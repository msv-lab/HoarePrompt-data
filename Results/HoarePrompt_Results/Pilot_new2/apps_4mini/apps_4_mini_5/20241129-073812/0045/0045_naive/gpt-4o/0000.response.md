To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: 
   ```python
   min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
   ```
   This calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is required to form a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers.

2. **Checking Feasibility**: 
   ```python
   if min_sum > n:
       return -1
   ```
   If `n` is less than this minimum sum, it's impossible to form such a sequence, so the function returns `-1`.

3. **Determining GCD and the Initial Sequence**:
   ```python
   d = n // min_sum
   remainder = n - d * min_sum
   sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
   ```
   Here, `d` is the integer factor that will help maximize the GCD of the sequence. The initial sequence is then created by multiplying each number from 1 to `k` by `d`.

4. **Distributing the Remainder**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
       if remainder == 0:
           break
       sequence[i] += 1
       remainder -= 1
   ```
   The loop adjusts the last elements of the sequence by distributing any leftover from the total `n`, ensuring the numbers remain strictly increasing.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:

- **When `k` is 1**: 
   If `k` is 1, then the only sequence possible would be `[n]`. The program handles this case correctly since the minimum sum condition is not violated.

- **When `n` is exactly equal to `min_sum`**: 
   If `n` is exactly equal to `min_sum`, the sequence will be `[1, 2, ..., k]`, which is strictly increasing and valid.

- **When `n` is slightly larger than `min_sum`**: 
   The program correctly distributes the remainder in order to adjust the sequence while keeping it strictly increasing.

- **When `n` is very large but `k` is also large**: 
   The calculations depend on the arithmetic operations of Python, which can handle large integers, so it should technically work.

### However, there is a critical flaw:
The program does not handle the distribution of the remainder correctly in all cases. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the minimum sum is 10 (1+2+3+4), and the sequence would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. If `n = 11`, the sequence would remain `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and we would need to add `1` to one of the elements, but the way the remainder is distributed could lead to a non-increasing sequence if not handled correctly.

**Counterexample**: 
- For `n = 11` and `k = 4`, the output should respect the strictly increasing condition. However, if the implementation incorrectly adjusts the last element, it might lead to an invalid sequence like `[1, 2, 3, 5]` which is still valid, but if the initial `d` is larger, it might get mismanaged.

### Conclusion:
There are potential cases where the logic of adjusting the last elements can fail to produce a strictly increasing sequence, especially in how the distribution of the remainder is handled. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
