According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is equal to `k % (n % k)`. Since `n` must not be a multiple of `k`, it follows that `n % k` is non-zero, and therefore `k % (n % k)` could also be non-zero, but we cannot confirm its value without more information on `k` and `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must remain non-zero. Since we only have the information that `b` is equal to `k % (n % k)`, we cannot ascertain whether `b` is currently non-zero. To ensure that the loop will execute again, we need to guarantee that `b` is non-zero. Thus, the state should reflect that `k` must be greater than `n % k` (which is guaranteed since `n` is not a multiple of `k`).

State: **`a` is equal to `n % k`, `b` is equal to `k % (n % k)` and `b` must be non-zero**
