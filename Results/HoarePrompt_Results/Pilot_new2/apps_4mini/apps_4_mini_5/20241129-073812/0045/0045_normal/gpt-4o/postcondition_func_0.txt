The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `k`, and first checks if the minimum possible sum of the first `k` natural numbers (calculated as `min_sum`) is greater than `n`. If so, it returns -1. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function computes a sequence of `k` integers where each integer is initially `d * (i + 1)` (with `d` being the number of times `min_sum` fits into `n`), and distributes any remaining value (the `remainder`) among the last `k` elements of the sequence. The output is the computed sequence. There are no additional edge cases covered in the annotations.
