Correctness: **False**

The provided program only calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, `a` (representing `n`) and `b` (representing `k`). However, the problem description requires generating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and have a maximal GCD. 

The program fails to address several key aspects of the problem:

1. **Sequence Generation**: The program does not construct or return any sequence of numbers, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem. Instead, it only computes the GCD.

2. **Conditions for a Sequence**: The algorithm does not check if it is possible to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sums up to `n`. For example, if `k` is larger than `n`, it is impossible to form such a sequence, and the program should return `-1` in that case.

3. **Maximal GCD**: The program does not attempt to create a sequence with the maximal GCD. Instead, it merely returns the GCD of `n` and `k`, which does not inform the user of the necessary sequence.

4. **Output Format**: The required output is a list of integers or `-1`, while the current program only returns a single integer (the GCD).

Due to these shortcomings, the program does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.
