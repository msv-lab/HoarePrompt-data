To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We need to form a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers such that their sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximized.
3. If it's not possible to create such a sequence, the output should be `-1`.

### Code Analysis:
- The code starts by checking if `n < k`. If true, it prints `-1`, which is correct since we cannot form a sequence of `k` distinct positive integers that sum to a number less than `k`.
- The code then attempts to construct a sequence by iterating from `1` to `k` and appending the numbers to the sequence while subtracting from `n`.
- After building the sequence, it checks if the length of the sequence is equal to `k`. If not, it prints `-1`.

### Missing Logic:
1. **Maximal GCD Requirement**: The GCD of the sequence formed by the current logic may not necessarily be maximal. The current construction does not take into account that the GCD could be improved by forming a different sequence. For example, when `n` and `k` are such that they allow for a sequence whose elements can share a larger GCD, the given logic ignores that.
   
2. **Example Consideration**:
   - Consider `n = 10` and `k = 3`:
     - The program might create the sequence `1, 2, 3` (which sums to 6) and will not be able to create a valid sequence of 3 numbers. However, the expected output could be `2, 3, 5` which sums to 10 with a GCD of 1, but there could be other combinations like `1, 4, 5` which also yield different GCDs.
   - More clearly, for `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the correct output should be `1, 2, 6` (GCD = 1) or `3, 3, 3` (GCD = 3) if we consider the potential for duplication (though `3, 3, 3` is not strictly increasing). This indicates the need for a better logic to maximize GCD.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the GCD of the resulting sequence is maximal and fails to properly account for constructing sequences that fit these conditions. There are cases where valid sequences exist that are not produced by this implementation.

Thus, the final verdict on the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
