The line of code `denominator //= gcd` means that the value of `denominator` will be divided by `gcd` using floor division. The initial state states that `denominator` is `2^k` and `gcd` is also `2^k`. Therefore, when we perform the operation, we will have:

1. `denominator` was `2^k`.
2. `gcd` is `2^k`.
3. Performing the operation `denominator //= gcd` will result in `denominator` being updated to `2^k // 2^k`, which equals `1`.

The other variables (`numerator` and `k`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 1, `k` is at least 2, `gcd` is equal to `2^k`**
