According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` must be at least 2. This means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be at least 2, and `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 4, `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 2**
