To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, I will analyze both the code and the problem description alongside the annotations.

### Problem Description:
The task is to compute the probability that at least two of `k` people share a birthday when there are `2^n` possible birthdays. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) where `A` is the numerator and `B` is the denominator. If there are more people than days (i.e., `k > 2^n`), the output should be (1, 1) because it's guaranteed at least two people share the same birthday.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`** - This function computes the GCD of two numbers, which is used later to reduce \( \frac{A}{B} \) to its irreducible form.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It first checks if `k > 2^n`. In this case, the output is (1, 1).
   - When `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`:
     - It computes the total number of days as `1 << n` (which equals \( 2^n \)).
     - It calculates `numerator` as the product of available days reduced each iteration (`total_days - i`), and `denominator` as \( (2^n)^k \).
     - It computes `p_shared` as the difference between `p_total` and `p_no_shared`, which is the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday.
     - Finally, it reduces \( \frac{A}{B} \) by their GCD and outputs the result modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Edge Cases:
Let’s consider edge cases based on the code and the problem description:
- **Case when `n = 1` and `k = 3`:**  
  Here, \( 2^n = 2 \) days and \( k = 3 > 2 \). The output should be (1, 1) as it's guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday. This case is handled correctly by the code.
  
- **Case when `n = 3` and `k = 2`:**  
  Here, \( 2^n = 8 \) days and \( k = 2 \). The probability that two people share a birthday is \( \frac{1}{8} \), which the code calculates correctly and returns \( 1, 8 \).

- **Case when `n = 4` and `k = 3`:**  
  Here, \( 2^n = 16 \) days and \( k = 3 \). The code should calculate the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday correctly, which it does, outputting \( 23, 128 \).

### Conclusion:
The only potential issue arises from the outputs being printed without checking if they’re in the irreducible form before performing the modulo operation. However, since the GCD is used after calculating \( A \) and \( B \), it ensures that \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime before applying the modulo operation. 

### Final Decision:
Given that all the edge cases align with the problem's requirements and the code handles them correctly, the code meets the expectations for all potential cases outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
