The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\). After executing the function, it always returns the tuple (1, 1). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` and return the fixed output (1, 1) regardless of the values of `n` and `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and always returns the tuple (1, 1).**
