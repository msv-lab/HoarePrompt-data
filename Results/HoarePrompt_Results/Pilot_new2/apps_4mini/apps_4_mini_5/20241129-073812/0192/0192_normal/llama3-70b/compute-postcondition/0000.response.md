`x` and `y` are assigned values from input, where the input consists of two integers separated by space, and `map(int, input().split())` converts them to integers. The precondition that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 still holds after this assignment, but the specific values of `x` and `y` will depend on the input provided during execution. Therefore, the output reflects the updated values of `x` and `y` based on the input.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, `x` and `y` are integers assigned from input**
