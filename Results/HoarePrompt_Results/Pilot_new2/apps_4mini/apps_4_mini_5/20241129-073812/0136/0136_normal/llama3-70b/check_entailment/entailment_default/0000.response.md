The provided program reads two long integers as strings, removes leading zeros, and then compares them. The expected output is to print `<`, `>`, or `=` based on the comparison.

Let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two inputs, `a` and `b`, and uses `lstrip('0')` to remove any leading zeros. This part aligns with the problem description that states the numbers may contain leading zeros.

2. **Comparison Logic**: After sanitizing the inputs:
   - If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints `=`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it prints `<`.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints `>`.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If both inputs are `0`, the program should return `=`, which it does since `0` stripped of leading zeros is still `0`.
   - The program can handle very large integers, up to the limit specified (10^6 digits). Python can compare strings lexicographically, and since leading zeros have been stripped, this comparison will yield the correct results for integers of varying lengths.
   - If one number is longer than the other after removing leading zeros, the longer number is greater. The current implementation handles this implicitly through string comparison.

Now, regarding the output hints:
- They state that the function removes leading zeros, compares the values, and prints the results. The hints accurately represent the program's behavior.

After thorough examination, I did not find any edge cases that the program fails to handle according to the problem description. The program seems to manage all specified cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem, including inputs with leading zeros and large integers.
