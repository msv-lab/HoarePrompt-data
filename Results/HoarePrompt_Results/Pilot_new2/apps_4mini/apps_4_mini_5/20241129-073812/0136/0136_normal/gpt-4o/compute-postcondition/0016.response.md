The code snippet provided is a print statement that outputs the string '<'. It does not change any variable values or states; it merely produces an output. The initial conditions regarding the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed, `b` is '0' if it was originally empty, or retains its value if not empty. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. The current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`.**
