Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros, and `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, since `a` is not equal to `b` and is greater than or equal to `b`, the output is '>'***
