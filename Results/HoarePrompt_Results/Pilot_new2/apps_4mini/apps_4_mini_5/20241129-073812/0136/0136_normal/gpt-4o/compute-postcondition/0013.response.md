The code snippet provided is a print statement that outputs the string `>` to the console. It does not modify any of the variables `a` or `b`, nor does it impact their values or types. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed, `b` is '0' if it was originally empty, or retains its value if not empty, and the string `>` has been printed to the console.**
