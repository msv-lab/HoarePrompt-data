The variable `a` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`. The `input()` function captures the input as a string, and the `lstrip('0')` method removes any leading zeroes from that string. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, if the input is purely zeroes (e.g., "0000"), `a` will become an empty string. Other variables, such as `b`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.**
