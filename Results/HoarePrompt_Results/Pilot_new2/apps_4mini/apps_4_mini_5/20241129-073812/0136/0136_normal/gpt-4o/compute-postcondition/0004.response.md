The value of `a` is assigned the string `'0'`. The previous state of `a` was an empty string. The other variable `b` remains unchanged, and `data` is also unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is now the string `'0'`, `b` is the string from `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, and `data` is a list of strings created from input.

Output State: **`a` is '0'; `b` is the string from `data[1]` with leading zeros removed; `data` is a list of strings created from input.**
