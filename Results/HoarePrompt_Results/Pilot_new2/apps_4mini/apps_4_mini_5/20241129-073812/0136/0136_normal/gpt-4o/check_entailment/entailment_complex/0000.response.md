Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input using `input().split()`, which captures both integers `a` and `b` in one go, as specified in the problem description. This is efficient for handling large inputs.

2. **Leading Zeros Removal**: 
   - The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both `a` and `b`. If the resulting string is empty after removing leading zeros, it assigns '0' to that string. This ensures that both `a` and `b` are correctly interpreted as non-negative integers without leading zeros.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The program first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. If one is shorter than the other, it directly determines which number is greater based on length (since a longer length corresponds to a larger value in this context).
   - If the lengths are equal, it uses string comparison to determine the relationship between `a` and `b`. This works because the strings are guaranteed to represent valid non-negative integers after leading zero removal.

4. **Output**: 
   - The program prints '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison results, which directly aligns with the output requirements specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The case where both inputs are empty or contain only zeros is effectively handled. Both `a` and `b` are turned into '0' if they are empty after leading zero removal, thus ensuring that the output will be '=' in such cases.

Overall, the program handles the comparison of very large integers represented as strings and follows the specified requirements for input/output format and leading zero handling accurately. Therefore, it is correct according to the problem description.
