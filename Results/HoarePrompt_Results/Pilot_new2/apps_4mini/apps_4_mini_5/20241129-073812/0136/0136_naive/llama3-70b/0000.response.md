Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where both input numbers consist of only leading zeros. For example, the input:

```
0000
0000
```

The expected output should be `=` since both numbers are equal, but the program will strip the leading zeros and compare empty strings, which would lead to a comparison giving an incorrect result. 

Furthermore, the program should handle the case where one number is entirely made up of leading zeros and the other is not. For example:

```
000000
0
```

The expected output should be `=` but the same logic would apply here as well, potentially leading to unexpected results. 

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential inputs as specified in the problem description.
