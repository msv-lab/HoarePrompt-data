To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to evaluate both the implementation in the code and the annotations against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We are asked to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r`, inclusive, such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and return this sum modulo `998244353`. 

### Code Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
    - This function checks if the number of unique digits in the integer `n` is less than or equal to `k`.
    - This functionality is aligned with the problem description, as we need to filter numbers based on their digit count.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
    - This function iterates through all integers from `l` to `r`.
    - It sums up the integers for which `func_1` returns `True`, meaning those numbers have at most `k` different digits.
    - The sum is computed modulo a defined constant `MOD`, which is presumably `998244353`.

### Potential Issues
The main issue arises when considering the range of values for `l` and `r`:
- The problem states that `l` and `r` can be as large as `10^18`. The `range(l, r + 1)` in `func_2` would attempt to iterate over potentially an enormous number of integers, which is computationally infeasible. This could lead to performance issues or even runtime errors due to memory constraints.

### Example Case
To highlight a specific failure case:
- If `l = 1` and `r = 10^18` with `k = 10`, the program will try to iterate from `1` to `10^18`, a vast range of numbers. The time complexity is O(n), where `n` could be up to `10^18`, making this approach impractical.

### Conclusion
Due to this inefficiency and the inability to handle the maximum constraints as specified in the problem, we can conclude that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
