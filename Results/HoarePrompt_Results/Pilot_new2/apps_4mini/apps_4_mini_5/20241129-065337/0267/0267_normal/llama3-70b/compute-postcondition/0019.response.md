Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `k` is not equal to 0. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then the pair `(n, k)` is now present in `dp` with `dp[n, k] = n`. Otherwise, `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged while `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 10 mod MOD`.***
