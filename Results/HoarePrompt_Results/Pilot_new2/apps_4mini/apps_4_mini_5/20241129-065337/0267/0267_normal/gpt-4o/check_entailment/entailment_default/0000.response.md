To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

### Problem Description
We need to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits and output the result modulo `998244353`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function 1**: `func_1(n, k)`
   - This function checks if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`. It converts `n` to a string, creates a set of its digits, and compares the length of this set to `k`.

2. **Function 2**: `func_2(l, r, k)`
   - This function calculates the sum of all numbers from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`. It uses a loop to iterate through each number in the range and adds it to `total_sum` if it meets the criteria.

### Output Hints
- **Function 1**: The hint correctly describes that it checks the number of unique digits in `n` and compares it to `k`.
  
- **Function 2**: The hint explains that the function sums the integers in the range from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits. It also indicates that the sum is computed modulo `MOD`.

### Edge Case Analysis
1. **Range Size**: The code uses `range(l, r + 1)` which is manageable for small ranges but can be inefficient when `r - l` is large, especially since `l` and `r` can go up to `10^18`. This could result in a very long loop potentially leading to performance issues.

2. **Unique Digits**: The function checks for uniqueness correctly, but it does not consider efficiency for large numbers. 

3. **Case of No Valid Numbers**: If there are no numbers in the range that comply with the digit condition, the program returns `0`, which is the correct behavior.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The implementation correctly applies the modulo operation during the summation process to avoid overflow.

### Issues Identified
The main concern is the potential inefficiency for large ranges since iterating from `l` to `r` could take too long if `r - l` is large. While the solution may theoretically be correct, it is impractical for large inputs as described in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the edge case of potentially very large ranges efficiently; it may run into performance issues when `r - l` is significantly large. Thus, while the logic of checking and summing seems correct, the implementation does not meet the performance requirements stipulated by the constraints.

Correctness: **False**.
