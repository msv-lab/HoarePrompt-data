The code assigns a new value to `dp[n, k]`, which is computed based on the provided variables. Since `k` is specified to be greater than 3 and `i` is currently 3, we can evaluate the expression step by step.

1. The value of `i` is currently 3.
2. The expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1)` calculates to `9 * 10 ** (3 - 1)` or `9 * 10 ** 2`, which equals `900`.
3. The term `10 ** (k - i)` refers to `10 ** (k - 3)`.
4. The term `10 ** (i - 1)` is `10 ** (3 - 1)` which we've determined is `100`.
5. Therefore, the complete expression is `dp[n, k] += 900 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`.

The variables `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged in this operation, while `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the above calculation.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `dp[n, k]` is updated to include the value `900 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`**.
