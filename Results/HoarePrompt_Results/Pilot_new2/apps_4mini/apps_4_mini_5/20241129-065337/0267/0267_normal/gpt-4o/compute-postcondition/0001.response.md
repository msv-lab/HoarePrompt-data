According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The `range(l, r + 1)` will generate numbers starting from `l` up to and including `r`. For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Given the constraints (1 <= l <= r < 10^18), we can confirm that the loop will execute as long as these conditions are satisfied.

At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0. So, for the loop to execute, the values of `l` and `r` must remain unchanged, ensuring that `l` is still less than or equal to `r`. Additionally, `num` should be initialized to `l`, the first number in the range.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
