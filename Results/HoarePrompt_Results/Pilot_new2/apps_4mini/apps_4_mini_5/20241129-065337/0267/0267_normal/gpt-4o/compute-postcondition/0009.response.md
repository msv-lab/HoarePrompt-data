In the provided code snippet, `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to its current value and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial state indicates that `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged and that the condition `r >= l + 2` is valid.

Since the initial values of `total_sum`, `num`, and `MOD` are not provided, we cannot determine the precise result of the arithmetic operation or the updated value of `total_sum`. However, we can describe the operation in general terms with respect to these variables.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, and `k` are unchanged; `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.**
