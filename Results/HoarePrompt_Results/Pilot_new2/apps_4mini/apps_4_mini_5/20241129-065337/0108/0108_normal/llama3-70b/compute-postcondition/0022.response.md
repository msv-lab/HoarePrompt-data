The variable `res` is updated to include the value of `char` by using the operation `res += char`, which appends `char` to the existing value of `res`. The initial state indicates that `s` includes the new value of `char`, and `res` is being modified to reflect the addition of `char`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `res` after this operation, while `s` remains unchanged as it only states the condition of including `char`.

Output State: **`s` must include the new value of `char`, `res` is updated to include `char` and is now equal to the previous value of `res` plus `char`.**
