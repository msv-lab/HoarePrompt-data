The value of `res` is incremented by the value of `char`. However, the previous value of `char` is unknown, and the states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` must contain the character 'a', and `res` is updated to include `char`.

Output State: **`s` must contain the character 'a', `res` is updated to `res + char`**
