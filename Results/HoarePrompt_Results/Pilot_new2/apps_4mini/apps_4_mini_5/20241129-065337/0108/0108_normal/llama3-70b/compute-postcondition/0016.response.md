`res` is assigned the value of `res` plus `char`. Since `s` must contain `char`, we can conclude that `char` is a character contained within `s`. The state of `s` and other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` must contain `char`, and `res` is updated to include `char`.

Output State: **`s` must contain `char`, `res` is updated to include `char`.**
