Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that we can replace any character of the string to the next character in alphabetical order (e.g., 'a' can be changed to 'b', 'b' to 'c', etc.), and that we want to ensure that the resulting string contains the entire English alphabet ("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz") as a subsequence.

The program only checks if the string `s` contains the letters of the target string in order, without actually implementing any character replacements. Therefore, it does not consider whether or not we can modify characters to create the required subsequence. 

For example, if the input string is "aabbcc", the program would incorrectly output "-1" since it does not contain all the characters of the target string in order. However, we can convert "aabbcc" to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" by replacing characters: 'a' to 'b', 'b' to 'c', 'c' to 'd', etc., which makes it possible to form the desired subsequence.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem description's requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
