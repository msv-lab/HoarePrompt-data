The code `s = s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)` replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. Since `char` is 'b', `ord(char)` gives the ASCII value of 'b', which is 98. Adding 1 gives us 99, and `chr(99)` is 'c'.

The initial state has `s` containing 'b', so after the replacement, `s` will now contain 'c'. The `char` and `res` variables remain unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains 'c', `char` is 'b', `res` is equal to `previous_value_of_res + 'b'`.

Output State: **`s` contains 'c', `char` is 'b', `res` is equal to `previous_value_of_res + 'b'**
