The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 0, and now it becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000 inclusive; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the current value of `s[i]` is equal to `target[0]`, which is 'a'.
