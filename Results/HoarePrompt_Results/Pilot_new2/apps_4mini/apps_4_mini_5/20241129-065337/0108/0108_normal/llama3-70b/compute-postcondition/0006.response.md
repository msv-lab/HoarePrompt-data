The code snippet `s = s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)` updates the string `s` by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the ASCII sequence. The character `char` is replaced by getting its ASCII value using `ord(char)`, adding 1 to it, and then converting it back to a character with `chr()`. 

Given that `s` must contain the character 'a', `char` can be assumed to be 'a' for this operation since it is likely that `char` is the character intended for replacement. Thus, after the replacement, 'a' will be replaced by 'b'.

The variable `res` is not directly affected by this operation, and its previous state is still valid in the output. 

Output State: **`s` contains 'b' (if 'a' was the only character in `s` or the first occurrence of 'a' is replaced); `res` is updated to `res + char` where `char` was the previous character replaced.**
