According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute for `i` from 0 up to `n-1`. If `n` is between 1 and 3, the possible values for `i` are 0, 1, and 2. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide the current value of `i`, we can infer that `i` is at the maximum value allowed for the loop given the range of `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and thus the maximum value of `i` at the end of the last iteration would be `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (to allow `i` to be 2).

So, if `i` was `n-1` (which could be 0, 1, or 2 depending on `n`), the next value of `i` will be `n` for the next iteration, and we need `n` to be greater than `i`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values initialized to [True] + [False] * (n-1), `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` remains unchanged, and `i` is `n`**
