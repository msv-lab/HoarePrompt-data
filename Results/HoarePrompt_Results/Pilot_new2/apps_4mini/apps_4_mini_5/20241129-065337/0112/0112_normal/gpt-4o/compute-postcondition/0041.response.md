Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `used_cubes[2]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[2]`, and if `used_cubes[2]` was not previously True and `digit` is in `cube_faces[2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
