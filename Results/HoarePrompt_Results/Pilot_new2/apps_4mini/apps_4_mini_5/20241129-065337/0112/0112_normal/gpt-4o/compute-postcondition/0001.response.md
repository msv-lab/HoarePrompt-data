The variable `used_cubes` is initialized as a list of boolean values, each set to `False`. The length of this list is determined by the value of `n`, which is an integer constrained between 1 and 3. Therefore, `used_cubes` can either be `[False]`, `[False, False]`, or `[False, False, False]` depending on the value of `n`. The other variables have not been affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values initialized to [False] * n.**
