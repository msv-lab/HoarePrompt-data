    return x
    #The program returns the maximum number 'x' that can be formed based on the contents of 'cubes', which is either 1 or 2 if n is 1 or 2, and 3 if n is 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of lists `cubes`. It calculates the maximum integer `x` that can be formed using the integers on the cube faces, returning `1` if `n` is `1`, `2` if `n` is `2`, and `3` if `n` is `3`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range of `1` to `3`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and each of the next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing the digits on the faces of the cubes.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` indicates which cubes have been used based on the presence of digits in `cube_faces`, and `found` is True if all digits were matched, or False if at least one digit could not be matched.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all digits were matched
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all of its digits can be matched with the faces of up to three cubes, represented as lists of integers. It returns True if all digits can be matched with unused cubes, and False if any digit cannot be matched or if all cubes have been used before finding a match for a digit. The function does not handle cases where there are fewer than the required cubes for matching or where digits cannot be matched due to constraints on cube usage.
