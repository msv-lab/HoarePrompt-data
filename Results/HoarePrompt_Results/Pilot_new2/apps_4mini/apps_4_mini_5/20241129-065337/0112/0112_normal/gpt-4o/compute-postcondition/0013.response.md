The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values with the last element set to True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` is True, `i` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
