The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` indicates which cubes have been used based on the presence of `digit` in the respective `cube_faces`; `found` is False; `i` is 2 (if `i` was previously 1) or `i` is 1 (if `i` was previously 0); `digits` must have at least `i + 1` digits.**
