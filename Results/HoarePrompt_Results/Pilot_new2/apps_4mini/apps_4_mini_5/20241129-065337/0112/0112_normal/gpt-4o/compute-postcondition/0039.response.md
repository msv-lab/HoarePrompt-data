The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, which is already its current value. Therefore, the state of `found` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `used_cubes[2]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[2]**
