Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with `-10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`, and `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is 0, the execution reflects that `c` is currently 0. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to 0, the output is 'YES' if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
