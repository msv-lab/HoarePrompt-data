The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned based on the integers received from the input. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are overwritten by the new values provided through `input()`, but we do not know what those new values are since they are dependent on user input. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from input, with `-10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`.**
