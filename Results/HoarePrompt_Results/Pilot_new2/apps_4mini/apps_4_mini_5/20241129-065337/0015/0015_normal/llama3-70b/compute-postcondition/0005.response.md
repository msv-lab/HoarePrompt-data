The code `print('NO')` outputs the string `'NO'`, but it does not change any of the variable values `a`, `b`, or `c`. The initial conditions regarding the values of these variables remain valid. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the fact that the output is `'NO'`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers assigned values from the input satisfying -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, the current value of `c` is 0, `a` is not equal to `b`, and the output is 'NO'.**
