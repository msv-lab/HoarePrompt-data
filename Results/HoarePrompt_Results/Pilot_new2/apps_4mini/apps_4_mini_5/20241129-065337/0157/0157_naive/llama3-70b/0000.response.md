Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

### Explanation:
1. The program first collects the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the user.
2. It then determines the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used in the ratio by calculating `min_lemon`, which is the minimum of:
   - `a` (the number of lemons available),
   - `b // 2` (the number of sets of apples, where each set requires 2 apples),
   - `c // 4` (the number of sets of pears, where each set requires 4 pears).
3. Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits used as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which corresponds to the total number of fruits used based on the number of complete sets of fruits.

The program handles edge cases effectively:
- If any of the counts of fruits is insufficient to form at least one complete set (like not having enough pears), `min_lemon` will be zero, resulting in an output of `0`, which is correct as per the problem description.

Thus, for all potential inputs within the defined constraints, the program functions as expected.
