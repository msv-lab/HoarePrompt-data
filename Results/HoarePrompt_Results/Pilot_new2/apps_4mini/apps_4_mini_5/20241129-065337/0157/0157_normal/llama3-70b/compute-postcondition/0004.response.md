`min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, the code executes a print statement that outputs the value of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This expression simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which is `min_lemon * 7`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the output is based on `min_lemon`. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` and the output of the print statement is `min_lemon * 7`.**
