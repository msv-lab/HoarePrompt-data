The value of `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial conditions state that `b` is a positive integer, and since the input must result in a positive integer for `b` to remain valid, we update `b` accordingly. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer (updated to the input integer), `c` is a positive integer**
