To assess the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its functionality against the problem description.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Operations**: 
   - The first operation involves assigning the first element of the sorted array `a` to a variable `b_x`.
   - Subsequent operations involve checking if a target value (from `a`) can be formed by the sum of the values stored in any two different variables from `b`.

2. **Key Logic in the Program**:
   - The program initializes a set `assigned` to keep track of the values successfully assigned to the variables.
   - For each subsequent target value in `a`, it checks if the target can be formed by the sum of any two distinct values already in `assigned`. If not, it increments the counter `m` indicating the need for an additional variable.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that any target value must either be the first element or the sum of two previously assigned values. If a target cannot be formed by any combination of the previously assigned values, then it correctly increments `m`.
   - However, the program does not check if it is impossible to form a number even with the maximum number of variables. For example, if the sequence has numbers that can never be formed from any combinations of previous numbers, the program would still return a count instead of `-1`.

### Example Case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  3
  3 6 5
  ```
  The expected output is `-1` because:
  - You cannot assign `3` to any variable and then create `5` from two `3`s, as you cannot use the same variable twice, and there are no other variables to use (since `6` is also not formable).
  
However, the program will add `3` to `assigned`, and then when it checks `6`, finds `3 + 3` is not valid, but will still increment `m` for `6`, leading to a faulty output.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly determine when it's impossible to perform the sequence of operations (as seen in the input case above). Thus, it does not handle all potential edge cases and could produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**.
