The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty set containing elements from the list `a`, `m` is unchanged, `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
