The value of `m` is incremented by 1. Given that `m` was set to 3 based on the condition that `a[2]` is not equal to `a[1] * 2`, `m` will now be 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and `m` is 4.**
