Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty set containing at least one additional element, and `x` is the next element in the set `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
