Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is a set containing elements from the list `a`, `m` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[k]` ≤ 10^9. The variable `can_form` is False, indicating that there does not exist an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`.***
