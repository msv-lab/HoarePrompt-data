To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided state and the loop structure. 

The loop is a `for` loop iterating over `assigned`, which is given as a set containing the element `a[0]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `assigned` must contain at least one element.

1. The state indicates that `assigned` is a set containing the element `a[0]`, which means the loop will execute once since there is at least one element in `assigned`.
2. The variable `i` is already set to 1, which is not directly affecting the loop execution.
3. The variable `can_form` is set to False, but this does not impact the execution of the loop itself; it likely pertains to a condition within the loop body.
4. The values for `n`, `m`, and the list `a` are already defined, ensuring that `a[0]` exists and is valid.

Given this understanding, we do not need to make any adjustments to the states, as the current state allows the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is a set containing the element a[0], `m` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9, `can_form` is False**
