#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and a is a list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    assigned = set()
    assigned.add(a[0])
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        
        if not can_form:
            m += 1
        
        assigned.add(a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `assigned` is a set containing all elements from the list `a`, `m` is the count of unique forms unable to be created from the elements of `assigned`, `n` is the original input value, `i` is `n - 1`.
    return m
    #The program returns the count of unique forms unable to be created from the elements of the set 'assigned' which is represented by 'm'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` containing `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list and counts the number of unique integers that cannot be expressed as the difference of two integers in a set formed by the elements of `a`. The function returns this count. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` might be empty or contain non-distinct elements, even though the input constraint requires `a` to have distinct integers.
