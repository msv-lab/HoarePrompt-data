The function accepts user input for three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two integers `a` and `b`, calculates the minimum block time and floor time between two specified points (a and b) within a grid defined by `n`, `m`, and `k`, and prints the total time it takes to travel between those points. Specifically, it computes the block difference and the floor difference, with the total time being based on defined constants for block and floor travel. There are no explicit return values from the function; it only prints the calculated time.
