The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue`. The value of `i` is `k + 1`, and since `r_queue` is being modified, it will now include this new value. The other variables remain unchanged in this context.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `k + 1`, `v` is the character at index `k + 1` in `votes`; `r_queue` now includes the value `k + 1`.**
