According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `fractions`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `fractions`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, meaning the string `fractions` has `n` characters. If the loop has run through the entire `fractions` string, it has processed all characters. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition must imply that there is at least one more character in `fractions` to process.

Since `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n`, after executing the loop until the last character, the next iteration would mean attempting to access a character at an index equal to `n`, which is out of bounds because the valid indices are from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `fractions` would need to contain at least one more character than it currently does, making it necessary to adjust `n` to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 + 1; `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n + 1`.**
