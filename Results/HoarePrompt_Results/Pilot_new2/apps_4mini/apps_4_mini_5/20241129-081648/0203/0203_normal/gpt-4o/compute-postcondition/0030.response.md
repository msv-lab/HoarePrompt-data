The code appends a new value to the `d_queue` list, which is calculated by adding `n` to `d_index`. The value of `d_index` represents the first element that was removed from `d_queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `d_index` is already known to hold a specific value (the removed first element of `d_queue`), the output will reflect that `d_queue` now has one additional element, which is `d_index + n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `r_queue` has one less element; `d_queue` has one less element and now contains the new element `d_index + n`; `d_index` holds the value of the removed first element of `d_queue`; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`.**
