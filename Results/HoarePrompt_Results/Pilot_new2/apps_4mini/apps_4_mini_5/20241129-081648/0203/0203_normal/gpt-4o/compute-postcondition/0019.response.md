According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `d_queue` and `r_queue`. For the loop to execute, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` must contain at least one element each.

The current state indicates that `votes` is a string of length `n`, which means `d_queue` and `r_queue` may or may not be empty. Since they are only empty if `votes` is empty, and we don't have any information suggesting `votes` is empty, we need to ensure that both queues are non-empty for the loop to execute.

To guarantee that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` contain elements, it is necessary to adjust the state so that:

1. `votes` must contain at least one 'D' character for `d_queue` to have elements.
2. `votes` must contain at least one 'R' character for `r_queue` to have elements.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `d_queue` and `r_queue` must not be empty**.
