The `r_queue` is updated by appending `r_index + n`, where `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`. Since `r_index` holds a specific value and `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000, the value of `r_queue` will now include this new element. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `r_queue` now includes an element equal to `r_index + n`; `d_queue` has one less element; `d_index` holds the value of the removed first element of `d_queue`; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`.**
