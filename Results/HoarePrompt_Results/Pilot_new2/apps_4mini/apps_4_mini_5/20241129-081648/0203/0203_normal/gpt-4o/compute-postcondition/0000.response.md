The code assigns a new value to `n` based on the input provided, which is expected to be an integer. The problem states that `n` is constrained such that it must be between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, and this condition is still valid after the assignment. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000, and the next line is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
