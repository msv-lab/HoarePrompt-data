Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are both empty; if `d_queue` executed for at least one iteration, then there must have been at least one 'D' and at least one 'R' in the original `votes`; the loop had to run until either `d_queue` or `r_queue` was empty, meaning there could have been multiple pairs of indices processed based on their relative values, resulting in their respective indices being incremented by `n` and re-added to their queues. `d_queue` is empty.***
