The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with a length of `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and its condition of being an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 still holds true. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
