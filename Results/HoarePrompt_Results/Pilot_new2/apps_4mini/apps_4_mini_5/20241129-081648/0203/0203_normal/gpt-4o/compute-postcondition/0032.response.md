Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has one less element and now contains the new element `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` has one less element and `r_index` remains the first element of the original `r_queue`. Otherwise, `r_queue` includes an element equal to `r_index + n`, `d_queue` has one less element, and `d_index` holds the value of the removed first element of `d_queue`, with `r_index` being the first element of the original `r_queue`.***
