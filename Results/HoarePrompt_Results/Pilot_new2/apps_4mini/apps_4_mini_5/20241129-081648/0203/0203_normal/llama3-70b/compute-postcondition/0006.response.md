The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the previous value of `depublicans`, but it remains unchanged except for the increment. The other variables `n`, `fractions`, and `fraction` retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `fraction` is equal to 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1**.
