The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input integer that must satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The string input of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the second input line is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `n` is an input integer.**
