The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `depublicans`, meaning it could be any integer. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 + 1; `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n + 1`; `depublicans` is increased by 1.**
