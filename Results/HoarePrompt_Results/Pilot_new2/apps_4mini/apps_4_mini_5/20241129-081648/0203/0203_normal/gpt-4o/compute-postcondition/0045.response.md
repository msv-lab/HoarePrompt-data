The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, it operates on an integer `n`, which is provided through the constraints such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200000`, and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' that represent the fractions of the employees. Based on the output, the function processes this string and returns a specific result related to the distribution of 'D' and 'R' characters. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a string of length `n` made up of the characters 'D' and 'R', and return a result based on the distribution of these characters.

Functionality: **The function processes a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and returns a result based on the distribution of these characters.**
