The variable `d_index` is assigned the value that is obtained from popping the first element of the `d_queue`. The operation removes this element from the `d_queue`, so `d_queue` will now contain one less element than it did before. The values of `n`, `votes`, and `r_queue` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `d_queue` contains one less element than before; `r_queue` must not be empty; `d_index` is the value of the first element in the original `d_queue`.**
