The `d_queue` list will have `d_index + n` appended to it. The current value of `d_index` is less than `r_index`, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `d_queue` now contains an additional element equal to `d_index + n`; `r_queue` has one less element than before; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`; `d_index` is the value of the first element in the original `d_queue`; the current value of `d_index` is less than the current value of `r_index`.
