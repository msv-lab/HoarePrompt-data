The value of `s` is updated to be `data[index + 2]`. Since `index` is equal to `n + 1`, the new value of `s` will be `data[n + 1 + 2]`, which is `data[n + 3]`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect this update.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 1])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 2])`, `s` is equal to `data[n + 3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is equal to `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0 or not equal to 0, `_` is equal to `T`.**
