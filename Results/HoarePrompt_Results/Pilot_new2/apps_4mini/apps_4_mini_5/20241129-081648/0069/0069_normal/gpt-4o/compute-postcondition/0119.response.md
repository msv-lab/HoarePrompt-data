Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s`. It calculates the balance of zeros and ones in `s`, constructs a prefix balance array, and determines results based on the relationship between `x` and the prefix balances. If the balance is zero, it checks if `x` is in the prefix balances; if so, it returns -1, otherwise 0. If the balance is not zero, it counts how many values in the prefix balances can be adjusted to reach `x` using the balance, returning this count. The function prints the results for each test case sequentially. **
