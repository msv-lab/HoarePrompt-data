Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is non-negative, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` is a list such that `prefix_balances[k]` is the balance computed from the first `k` characters of `s`, with `prefix_balances[n]` equal to `balance + prefix_balances[0]`, the current value of `balance` is 0. If `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, then `results` is updated to include -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then `results` has an additional entry of 0.***
