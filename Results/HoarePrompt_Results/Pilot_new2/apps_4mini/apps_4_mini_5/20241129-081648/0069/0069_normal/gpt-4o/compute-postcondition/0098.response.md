Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is non-negative, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` must have at least 1 element, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, `count` is 0. The value of `x` minus `b` is divisible by `balance`, and the result of `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative.***
