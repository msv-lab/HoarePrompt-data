To analyze the impact of the code snippet on the initial state, we can see that:

1. `index` is equal to `n + 1`, meaning it is referencing a position in the `data` list that is one greater than the value of `n`.
2. The code `x = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the value of `data[index + 1]`, converted to an integer, to `x`.

Since `index` is `n + 1`, this means that `x` will be assigned the value from the `data` list at position `n + 2` (because we are adding 1 to `index`). 

We still have the following conditions valid:
- `T` is between 1 and 100.
- `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 1])`.
- `s` is equal to `data[3]`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `balance` is equal to 0 or not equal to 0 (depending on previous states).
- `_` is equal to `T`.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 1])`, `x` is equal to the integer value of `data[n + 2]`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is equal to `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0 or not equal to 0, and `_` is equal to `T`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 1])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is equal to `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0 or not equal to 0, `_` is equal to `T`.**
