The code `print(result)` does not change the value of any variables; it simply outputs the value of `result`. The initial state indicates that `result` is the first element in the list `results`, which contains at least one value. Since this value is printed, it is part of the output, but the variable itself remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing at least 1 value, `result` is the first element in `results` (which has been printed).**
