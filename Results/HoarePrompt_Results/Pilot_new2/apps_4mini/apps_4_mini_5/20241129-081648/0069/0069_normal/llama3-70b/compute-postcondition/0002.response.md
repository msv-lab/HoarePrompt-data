The values of `n` and `x` are assigned based on the input split into integers. `n` is a positive integer, and `x` is an integer within a specified range. The previous states of `T` and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer within the specified range, `s` is a binary string of length `n`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer within the specified range, `s` is a binary string of length `n`.**
