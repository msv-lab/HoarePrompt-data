The code `results.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `results`. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is non-negative, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[k]` is the balance computed from the first `k` characters of `s`, with `prefix_balances[n]` equal to `balance + prefix_balances[0]`, the current value of `balance` is 0, `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, and `results` has an additional entry of 0.
