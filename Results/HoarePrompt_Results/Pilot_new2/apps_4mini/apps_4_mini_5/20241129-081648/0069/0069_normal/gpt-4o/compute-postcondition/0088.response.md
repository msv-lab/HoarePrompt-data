To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze how the loop modifies the state of the variables based on the initial conditions and the code of the loop.

The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, and during each iteration, it updates `prefix_balances[i]` based on the character at index `i - 1` of the string `s`. Specifically, it adds 1 if the character is '0' and subtracts 1 if the character is '1'.

After all iterations have executed, we can summarize the output state as follows:

1. The variable `T` remains between 1 and 100.
2. The variable `n` indicates the length of the string `s` and must be non-negative for the loop to execute.
3. The variable `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop has finished executing.
4. The `prefix_balances` list will contain the cumulative balance of zeroes and ones from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[n]` will reflect the final cumulative balance after processing all characters in `s`. Specifically, `prefix_balances[n]` is calculated as `prefix_balances[0] + (s.count('0') - s.count('1'))`, since `prefix_balances[0]` starts as zero.

Thus, if `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute exactly `n` times, computing `prefix_balances` accordingly.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is non-negative, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[k]` is the balance computed from the first `k` characters of `s`, with `prefix_balances[n]` equal to `balance + prefix_balances[0]`**.
