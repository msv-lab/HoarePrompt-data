The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. The initial state indicates that `n` is defined as `int(data[index])`, but we do not have specific values for `data` or `index`. However, `x` is being set based on the value found at the index `index + 1` in the `data` array. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the new value of `x` while retaining the context of the other variables.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is int(data[index]), `i` is either `n` or `n + k`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n` or `n + k`, `x` is int(data[index + 1])**
