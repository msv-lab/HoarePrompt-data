Output State: **`T` is 0, `n` is a positive integer input, `x` is an input integer within the specified range, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. The output for each iteration depends on the relationship between `balance` and `x`, with outputs being either `n + 1`, `-1`, or `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` for each iteration of the loop.**
