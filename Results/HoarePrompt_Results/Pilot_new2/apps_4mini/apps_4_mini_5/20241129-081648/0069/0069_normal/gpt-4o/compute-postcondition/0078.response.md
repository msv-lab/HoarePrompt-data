The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The values of `T`, `n`, `i`, `prefix_balances`, and `x` remain unchanged as the new assignment only affects `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is int(data[index]), `i` is either `n` or `n + k`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n` or `n + k`, `x` is int(data[index + 1]), and `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is int(data[index]), `i` is either `n` or `n + k`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n` or `n + k`, `x` is int(data[index + 1]), `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]**.
