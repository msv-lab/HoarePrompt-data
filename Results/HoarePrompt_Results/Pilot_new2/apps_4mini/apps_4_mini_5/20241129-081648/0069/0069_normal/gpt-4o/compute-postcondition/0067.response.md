The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so the new value of `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected, so they remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` contains cumulative balance values up to `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 2 if `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`.**
