The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is equal to `n + 1`, so after the increment, the new value of `index` will be `n + 1 + 3`, which simplifies to `n + 4`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 1])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 2])`, `s` is equal to `data[n + 3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is equal to `n + 4`, `balance` is equal to 0 or not equal to 0, `_` is equal to `T`.**
