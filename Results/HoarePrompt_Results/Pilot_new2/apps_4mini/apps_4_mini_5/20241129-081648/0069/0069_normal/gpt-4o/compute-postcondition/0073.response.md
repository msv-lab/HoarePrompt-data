The code `results.append(count)` appends the value of `count` to the list `results`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, we retain the initial values of all other variables while noting that `results` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `count`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n + k`, `prefix_balances` contains cumulative balance values up to `n + k`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is equal to the number of times `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance` for each `b` in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now contains the value of `count`.**
