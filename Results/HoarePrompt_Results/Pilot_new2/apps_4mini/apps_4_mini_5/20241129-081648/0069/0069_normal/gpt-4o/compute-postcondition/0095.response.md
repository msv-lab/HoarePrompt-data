Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is non-negative, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[k]` is the balance computed from the first `k` characters of `s`, with `prefix_balances[n]` equal to `balance + prefix_balances[0]`, and the value of `balance` is not equal to 0.***
