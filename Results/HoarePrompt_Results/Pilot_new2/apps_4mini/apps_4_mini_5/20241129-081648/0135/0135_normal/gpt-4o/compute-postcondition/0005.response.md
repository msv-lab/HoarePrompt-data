The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `i` is currently 1. Since any integer modulo 1 is always 0, `remainder` will be 0 regardless of the value of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is less than `n`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
