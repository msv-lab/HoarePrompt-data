According to the code, the for loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `k` is guaranteed to be less than `n` and both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, we know that `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Given that `seen_remainders` is an empty set, it does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take values from 1 to `k`, inclusive. Therefore, when the loop starts executing, the first value of `i` will be 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is less than `n`, `i` is 1**
