`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `i` is `k + 1`. The value of `i` is therefore within the range of `2` to `n` (because `1 ≤ k < n`, leading to `2 ≤ i ≤ n`). The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the calculated remainder based on the initial values of `n` and `k`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`; `i` is `k + 1`; `remainder` is `n % (k + 1)`**
