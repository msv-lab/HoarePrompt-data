The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, in which case it returns 'No'. Then, it computes the remainder of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during these calculations, it returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, it concludes by returning 'Yes'. Thus, it effectively checks whether the remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k` are all distinct, returning 'Yes' only if they are.
