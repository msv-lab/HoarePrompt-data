The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. 

### Explanation of Issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remainders**: The program checks if all the remainders of `n % i` for `1 ≤ i ≤ k` are distinct. However, the program assumes that if `k >= n`, it can immediately return 'No'. This is actually a flaw because:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the modulo operation `n % i` for `i = n` will give a remainder of 0, which can overlap with other values (e.g., `n % 1` will also give 0).
   - The program does not consider the case where `k` can be equal to or greater than `n` correctly, as there could be other overlaps in the range depending on the values involved.

2. **Distinct Remainders**: The requirement is strictly about checking whether all the values of `n % i` for the range of `i` are distinct. The program can produce incorrect results if it does not fully evaluate and compare all valid remainders within the specified range.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**: The edge case where `k` is very small and `n` is large or vice versa is not adequately handled, as the logic does not account for the full range of possibilities for overlap of remainders.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the program does not adhere to the requirements of the problem description accurately. It could lead to incorrect outputs for some inputs, particularly those where `k` is equal to or larger than `n`. 

Therefore, the output for the correctness check should be:

Correctness: **False**
