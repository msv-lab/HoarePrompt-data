In the code snippet, `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `i`. Since the previous value of `max_divisor` is unknown, we denote it as `max_divisor`. The variable `i` has a value of 3. 

Thus, the value of `max_divisor` will be either its previous value (unknown) or 3, depending on which is greater. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` must be at least 9, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is max(max_divisor, 3)**.
