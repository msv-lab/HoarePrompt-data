The variable `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is 2, `max_divisor` will be either its previous value or 2, whichever is greater. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is updated to be max(max_divisor, 2).**
