#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where the first two integers represent N (the number of elements) and K (the maximum number of operations), followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N satisfying 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(lst):
    gcd_result = lst[0]
    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `gcd_result` is the GCD of all integers in `lst`, where `gcd_result` is equal to gcd(lst[0], lst[1], ..., lst[len(lst) - 1]).
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns gcd_result which is the GCD of all integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers where the first integer represents N, the second integer represents K, and the subsequent integers are the elements from which to compute the GCD. It returns the GCD of all the integers in the list. The function assumes that there are at least two integers in the list and does not handle cases where the list has fewer integers or if any integers are zero, which could cause the GCD calculation to be undefined in certain contexts.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N integers A, each between 1 and 10^6 (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N).
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a tuple where the first element `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element `K` is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of `N` integers `A` (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N). `divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `N`, including `1`, `N`, and any other divisors found through the loop iterations.
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of all divisors of N in descending order, where N is a positive integer between 2 and 500.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple containing a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and a list A of N integers (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6). It calculates and returns a sorted list of all divisors of N in descending order. The function does not utilize the values of K or A in its computations, which may indicate missing functionality.
