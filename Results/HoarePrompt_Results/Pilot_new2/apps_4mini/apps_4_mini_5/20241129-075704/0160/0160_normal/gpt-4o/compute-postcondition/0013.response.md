Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where the first element `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element `K` is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of `N` integers (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N). If `N` is divisible by `i` (where `i` is `int(math.sqrt(N)) + 1`), then the `divisors` set includes the value `N // i`.***
