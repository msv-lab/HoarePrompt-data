The function accepts an integer input `s` (ranging from 0 to 99) and prints its English word representation. For values less than 10, it prints single-digit names; for values between 10 and 19, it prints teen names; and for values from 20 to 99, it prints a combination of tens and ones (with a hyphen if necessary). The function does not return any value.
