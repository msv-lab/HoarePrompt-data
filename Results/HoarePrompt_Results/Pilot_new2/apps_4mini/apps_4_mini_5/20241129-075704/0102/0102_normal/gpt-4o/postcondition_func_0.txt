The function accepts an integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= 99) and returns its English string representation. It handles numbers from 0 to 9 by using the `ones` list, numbers from 11 to 19 using the `teens` list, multiples of 10 from 10 to 99 using the `tens` list (e.g., 'ten', 'twenty'), and returns a combination of `tens` and `ones` for other values (e.g., 'twenty-one'). However, the function does not account for the case when `n` is 10, which is intended to return 'ten' but is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations.
