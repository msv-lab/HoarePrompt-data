The code assigns the value of `max_pos` to be the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The variable `n` is constrained to be between 2 and 100, and `a` contains distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. Therefore, `max_pos` will hold the index of `n` within `a`.

Since `n` is guaranteed to be in the list `a` (as it contains all integers from 1 to `n`), we can conclude that `max_pos` will hold a valid index corresponding to the position of `n` in `a`.

The output state will now reflect the updated value of `max_pos` while keeping the preconditions of `n`, `a`, and `min_pos` intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive); `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in list `a`.**
