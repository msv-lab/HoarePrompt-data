The variable `dist4` is assigned the value `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The initial conditions state that `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers between `1` and `n`. Thus, the value of `dist4` will depend on the values of `n` and `min_pos`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive); `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos`.**
