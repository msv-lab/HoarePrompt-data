The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and n inclusive), calculates the distances of the elements 1 and n from the ends of the list, and returns the maximum of those distances by printing it. If either integer 1 or n is not present in the list, a ValueError will occur.
