The `max_distance` variable is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of these distance variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Thus, `max_distance` now holds the maximum of those four distances.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive); `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is equal to `max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)`.**
