The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate values. The input values will be integers that the user provides, and since `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is guaranteed to be in the range from 1 to `n`, this remains valid. The variable `n` retains its value as an integer between 2 and 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is updated to the value of `int(input())` within the range of 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from the user input.**
