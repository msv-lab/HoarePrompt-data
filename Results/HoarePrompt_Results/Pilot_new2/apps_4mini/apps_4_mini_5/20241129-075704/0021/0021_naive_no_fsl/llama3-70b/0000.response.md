To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements
1. We need to find the positions of the minimum element (1) and maximum element (n) in the given permutation.
2. We want to perform exactly one swap to maximize the distance between these two elements.
3. The output should be the maximum possible distance after the swap.

### Analyzing the Code
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos1 = a.index(1)
posn = a.index(n)
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The first line reads the integer `n`, which is the size of the permutation.
   - The second line reads the permutation itself.

2. **Finding Positions**:
   - `pos1` is the index of the minimum element (1).
   - `posn` is the index of the maximum element (n).

3. **Calculating Distances**:
   - `max_dist` is calculated as the maximum of the current distance between `1` and `n`, minus one, and `n - 2`.
   - `min_dist` is calculated as the minimum of the current distance minus one, and `n - 2`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

### Issues in the Code
The logic for calculating `max_dist` and `min_dist` seems incorrect. Specifically:
- The code does not properly consider the positions of `1` and `n` when trying to maximize their distance through a swap.
- The term `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` does not accurately capture the goal of maximizing the distance after a swap.

### Testing Potential Case
Consider the input:
```
4
2 1 3 4
```

- Here, `pos1` would be `1` (index of `1`), and `posn` would be `3` (index of `4`).
- The distance before any swap is `|1 - 3| = 2`.
- The maximum distance after a swap should be `|0 - 3| = 3` or `|1 - 2| = 1`, hence the output should be `3`.

However, the logic in the program might yield a different (and incorrect) calculation because it does not directly calculate the best possible distances after considering the swap.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem and can lead to wrong outputs in certain cases, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**
