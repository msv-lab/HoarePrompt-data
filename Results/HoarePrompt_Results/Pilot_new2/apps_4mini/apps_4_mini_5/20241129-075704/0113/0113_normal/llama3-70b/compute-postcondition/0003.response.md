`n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 and is not a multiple of 10, `n` can take any value from that range except multiples of 10. After incrementing, `n` will still be a positive integer, and it will no longer meet the condition of being a multiple of 10 if it was close to a multiple of 10. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 + 1 and `n` must not be a multiple of 10.**
