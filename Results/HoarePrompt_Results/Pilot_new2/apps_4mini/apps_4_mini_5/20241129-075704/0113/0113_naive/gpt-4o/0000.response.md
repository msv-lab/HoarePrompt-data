To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program.

The program defines a function `func_1(n, k)` that computes the k-rounding of n. The logic involves calculating a multiplier that is `10 ** k`, then it computes the minimum integer x that is divisible by n and ends with k zeros by using the greatest common divisor (gcd) to ensure that x has the correct number of trailing zeros.

### Potential Issue:
1. **When k = 0**: The problem states that for k = 0, the output should be n itself. The program will correctly return n when k = 0 because `multiplier` will be `1` (since `10 ** 0 = 1`). Thus `x` becomes `n * (1 // gcd(n, 1))`, which simplifies to `n`. This part works as expected.

2. **General Case for k > 0**:
   - For k > 0, the function calculates `x` using the formula `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. 
   - The `multiplier` being `10 ** k` ensures that x has at least k trailing zeros.
   - The usage of `gcd` here seems appropriate as it helps in determining the least multiple of `n` that has k trailing zeros.

3. **Example Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 375` and `k = 4`, `10 ** k` gives `10000`, and `gcd(375, 10000)` would be `125`, meaning `x = 375 * (10000 // 125) = 375 * 80 = 30000`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 10000` and `k = 1`, the same logic applies, and it results in `10000` directly, which is also correct.
   - For `n = 38101` and `k = 0`, it returns `38101`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 123456789` and `k = 8`, it calculates correctly to `12345678900000000`.

### Summary:
Looking through various cases, including edge cases and the provided examples, the program consistently produces the correct output as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the assessment:

Correctness: **True**. 
The program correctly implements k-rounding as described in the problem statement.
