The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` will be a non-negative value (greater than or equal to 0). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`; the current value of `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`; `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`, which is a non-negative value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`; the current value of `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`; `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`, which is non-negative.**
