`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `min_time` is equal to `time`; `ans` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`; `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`; `time` is `(t - s) % d`.**
