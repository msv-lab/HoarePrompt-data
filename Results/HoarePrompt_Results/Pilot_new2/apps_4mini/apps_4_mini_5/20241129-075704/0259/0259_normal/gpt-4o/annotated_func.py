#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, and bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000.
def func_1(n, t, bus_routes):
    min_wait_time = float('inf')
    chosen_route = -1
    for i in range(n):
        s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]
        
        if s_i >= t:
            wait_time = s_i - t
        elif (t - s_i) % d_i == 0:
            wait_time = 0
        else:
            wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
        
        if wait_time < min_wait_time:
            min_wait_time = wait_time
            chosen_route = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time across all bus routes, `chosen_route` is the index (1-indexed) of the bus route with the minimum wait time, `n` is the total number of bus routes, and `bus_routes` remains unchanged as a list of tuples with routes defined by their starting and destination values.
    return chosen_route
    #The program returns the index (1-indexed) of the bus route with the minimum wait time, which is given by 'chosen_route'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of bus routes), a positive integer `t` (the current time), and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, where each tuple contains two integers representing the starting time and the frequency of the bus. It calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route and returns the 1-indexed index of the bus route with the least wait time. If all bus routes start after time `t`, it will return the index of the first bus route as the wait time will be the difference between that route's start time and `t`. If no bus routes are available, it will return -1 by default, but this case is not explicitly handled in the code.
