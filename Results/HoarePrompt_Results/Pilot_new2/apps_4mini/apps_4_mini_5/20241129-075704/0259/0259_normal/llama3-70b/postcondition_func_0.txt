The function accepts two positive integers `n` (number of bus routes) and `t` (current time), collects `n` tuples of bus route parameters `(s_i, d_i)`, calculates the minimum wait time for the buses, and prints the 1-based index of the bus that results in the minimum wait time. If there are no bus routes, it would print -1.
