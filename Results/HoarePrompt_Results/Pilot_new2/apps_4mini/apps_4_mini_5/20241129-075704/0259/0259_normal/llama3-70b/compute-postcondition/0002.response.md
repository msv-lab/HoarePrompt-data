According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, as specified by the range of the for loop. Given that `n` is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 100, the loop will definitely execute. The variable `buses` is an empty list, which does not affect the execution of the loop.

At the start of the loop, the loop variable (in this case represented by `_`) does not need to be initialized to any specific value since it is typically used as a throwaway variable when the value is not needed inside the loop body. However, since the loop will execute `n` times, the loop will iterate from 0 to `n-1`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is an empty list, loop variable is 0 at the start of the first iteration**.
