The values of `s` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from the input, where `input().split()` splits the input string into two parts and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous values of `s` and `d` are not defined since they are assigned new values based on the input. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple (s, d), loop variable is 2, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.**
