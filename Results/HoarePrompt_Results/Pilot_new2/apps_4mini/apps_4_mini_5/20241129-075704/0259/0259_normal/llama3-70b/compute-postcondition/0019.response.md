Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); if `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is set to `time`, `ans` is updated to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. Otherwise, the values of `min_time`, `ans`, `i`, `s`, `d`, and `time` remain unchanged.***
