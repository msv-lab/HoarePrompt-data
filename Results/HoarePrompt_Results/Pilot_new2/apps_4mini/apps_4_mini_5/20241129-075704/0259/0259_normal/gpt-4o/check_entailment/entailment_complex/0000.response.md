Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the specifications outlined in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of bus routes), `t` (the time Serval arrives at the bus station), and `bus_routes` (a list of tuples containing the arrival time of the first bus and the interval for subsequent buses). This matches the expected input format described.

2. **Calculation of Wait Times**:
   - The program correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route.
   - If the first bus of a route arrives after `t`, it computes the wait time as the difference between the bus's arrival time and `t`.
   - If a bus arrives at the exact time `t`, the wait time is correctly considered as zero.
   - If the first bus arrives before `t`, it calculates the next available bus time using the formula `(t - s_i) % d_i` to determine how long Serval must wait for the next bus.

3. **Selection of the Best Route**:
   - The program maintains a variable `min_wait_time` to track the shortest wait time found, and `chosen_route` to store the index of the route with the minimum wait time.
   - During the iteration over the bus routes, if a route has a shorter wait time than previously recorded, it updates `min_wait_time` and sets `chosen_route` appropriately.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `chosen_route`, which is 1-indexed (as required by the problem description), indicating the bus route Serval will take. If all buses are scheduled to arrive after `t`, the logic ensures that the first bus route is chosen due to how the minimum wait time is calculated.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
   - If all buses arrive after `t`, it will still select the first bus route due to the structure of the loop and how wait times are determined.
   - The function does not explicitly handle the case where no bus routes are present (though this case is outside the constraints), but it defaults to returning `-1` in such scenarios, which won't occur with the given constraints.

Overall, the logic flows correctly according to the problem description, ensuring that Serval gets on the earliest possible bus based on the defined conditions. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
