Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of bus routes), a positive integer `t` (the current time), and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, where each tuple contains two integers representing the starting time and the frequency of the bus. It calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route and returns the 1-indexed index of the bus route with the least wait time. If all bus routes start after time `t`, it will return the index of the first bus route as the wait time will be the difference between that route's start time and `t`. If no bus routes are available, it will return -1 by default, but this case is not explicitly handled in the code.**
