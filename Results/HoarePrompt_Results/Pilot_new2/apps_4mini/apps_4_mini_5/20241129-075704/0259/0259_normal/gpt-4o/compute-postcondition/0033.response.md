Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]`; `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0] - t`, `min_wait_time` is updated to equal `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, `min_wait_time` is updated to equal 0, and `chosen_route` is set to 2. If not, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, `min_wait_time` is updated to equal `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to 2.***
