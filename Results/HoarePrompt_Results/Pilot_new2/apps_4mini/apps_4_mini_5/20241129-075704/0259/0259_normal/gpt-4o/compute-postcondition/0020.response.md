The statement `wait_time = 0` assigns the value of `0` to the variable `wait_time`. The initial conditions of `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. The state of the other variables is not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0]`, `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][1]`, `wait_time` is 0**.
