Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2; `t` is an integer in the range 1 to 100000; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `i` is 2; `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`; `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`; `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 3.***
