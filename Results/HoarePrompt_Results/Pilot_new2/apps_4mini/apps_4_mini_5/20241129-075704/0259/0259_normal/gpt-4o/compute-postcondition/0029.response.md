Let's analyze the provided code snippet step by step based on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]`
- `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`
- `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time` if updated
- `min_wait_time` is updated to equal `wait_time`
- `chosen_route` is set to 2

Now, executing the code:
```
wait_time = s_i - t
```

Impact of the code:
- `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The exact value of `s_i` is still maintained as `bus_routes[2][0]`, and `t` is a variable which is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, `wait_time` will be equal to `bus_routes[2][0] - t`.

Other variables remain unaffected, and any conditions regarding `min_wait_time` are not explicitly calculated here since the updated value depends on the comparison after this assignment.

Output State:
**`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]`; `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`; `wait_time` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0] - t`; `min_wait_time` is updated to equal `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is set to 2.**
