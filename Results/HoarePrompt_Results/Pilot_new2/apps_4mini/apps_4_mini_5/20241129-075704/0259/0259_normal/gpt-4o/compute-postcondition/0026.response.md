Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0]`, `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][1]`, and `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to equal `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to 2. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, no changes are made to `min_wait_time` or `chosen_route`.***
