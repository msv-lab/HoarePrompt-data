The code appends a tuple (s, d) to the list `buses`. The values of `n`, `t`, and the loop variable remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. The list `buses`, which was initially empty, now contains one element, which is the tuple consisting of the input integers `s` and `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is a list containing the tuple (s, d), loop variable is 0 at the start of the first iteration, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.**
