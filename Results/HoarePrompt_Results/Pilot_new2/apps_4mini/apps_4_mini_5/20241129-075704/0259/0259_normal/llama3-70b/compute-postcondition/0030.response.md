Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `min_time` is the minimum time calculated from all buses, `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus that results in the minimum time, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is the first element of the last tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the last tuple in `buses`. If the loop does not execute (if `n` is 0), then `min_time` remains as positive infinity, and `ans` remains -1.**
