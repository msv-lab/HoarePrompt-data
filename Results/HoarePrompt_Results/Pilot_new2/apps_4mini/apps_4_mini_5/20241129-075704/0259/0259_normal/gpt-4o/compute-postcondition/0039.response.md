The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of bus routes.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100000, representing the wait time.
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i`, with the constraints 1 ≤ s_i, d_i ≤ 100000, representing the start and destination of each bus route.

The function returns the index (1-indexed) of the bus route with the minimum wait time, referred to as `chosen_route`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, and return the index of the bus route that has the minimum wait time. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer), t (positive integer), and bus_routes (list of tuples), and returns the 1-indexed index of the bus route with the minimum wait time.**
