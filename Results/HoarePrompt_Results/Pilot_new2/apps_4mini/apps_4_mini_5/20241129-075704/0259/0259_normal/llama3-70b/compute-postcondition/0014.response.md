According to the code, the loop iterates over the `buses` list, which contains `n` tuples of the form (s, d). For the loop to execute at least once, the `buses` list must contain at least one tuple, which is ensured since `n` is given to be within the range of 1 to 100. 

Since `i` is the loop variable that will take on the values from 0 to `n-1` as the loop iterates over the indices of the `buses` list, it will start at 0 for the first iteration. The values of `s` and `d` will be the first tuple in the `buses` list during the first iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `i` must be initialized to 0.
2. `s` and `d` must be adjusted to the first elements of the first tuple in the `buses` list (i.e., `s` is the first element and `d` is the second element of the first tuple).

State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d), `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`**.
