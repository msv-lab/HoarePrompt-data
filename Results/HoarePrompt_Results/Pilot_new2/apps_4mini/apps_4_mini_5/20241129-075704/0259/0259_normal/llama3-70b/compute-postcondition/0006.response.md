The values of `s` and `d` are assigned input integers, which are mapped from the input string split into two parts. The variable `buses` is not affected in this code snippet, so we only need to update `s` and `d`. 

The output state will reflect the new values of `s` and `d` as input integers, while maintaining the existing constraints on the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is a list containing the tuple (s, d), loop variable is 1, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.**
