The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is a non-empty collection, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is True, with the condition that the value of `a[i] - x` is an element of the `assigned` collection still being valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is a non-empty collection, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element of the `assigned` collection.**
