The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact new value. The other variables remain unchanged and valid with their initial states. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is a collection of elements that have been checked, `can_form` is False, and `m` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is a collection of elements that have been checked, `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1.**
