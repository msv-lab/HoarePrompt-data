The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The condition for `n` being a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23 remains valid after this assignment, but its specific value is now determined by the user input. The list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers is not affected by this line of code, keeping its previous state intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23 (value is determined by user input); `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.**
