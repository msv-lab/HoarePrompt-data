The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `a[0]`, the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is `True`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `a[0]`, the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`, `can_form` is True.**
