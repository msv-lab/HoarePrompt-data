The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` was 1, so the new value of `m` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and their states are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `assigned` contains all elements from `a` that were checked; `m` is 2; `i` is 1; `can_form` is False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `assigned` contains all elements from `a` that were checked; `m` is 2; `i` is 1; `can_form` is False.**
