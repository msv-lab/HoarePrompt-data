The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `assigned`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` must have at least 4 elements, `x` is the fourth element in `assigned`, `i` is 3, and `can_form` is True.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` must have at least 4 elements, `x` is the fourth element in `assigned`, `i` is 3, `can_form` is True**.
