According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n - 1`, so the next value of `i` must remain less than `n` for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and `i` is currently 1. This means that `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 1, and it will be incremented to 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `i` is 2**
