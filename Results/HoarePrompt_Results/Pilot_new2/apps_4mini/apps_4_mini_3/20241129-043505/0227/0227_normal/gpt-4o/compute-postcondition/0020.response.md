Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains all elements from `a` that were checked, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False, meaning there does not exist any element `x` in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also an element of `assigned`.***
