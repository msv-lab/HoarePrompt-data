The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the third element of `assigned`, `can_form` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
