The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is a non-empty collection, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, `can_form` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
