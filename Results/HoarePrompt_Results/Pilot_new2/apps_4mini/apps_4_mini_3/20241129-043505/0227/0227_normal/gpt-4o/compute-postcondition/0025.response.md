The value of `can_form` is explicitly assigned as `False`, which means that it remains unchanged since it was already `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains all elements from `a` that were checked plus `a[1]`, `i` is 2, `can_form` is False**
