The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` includes `a[2]`, `assigned` is not empty, `i` is 2, and the value of `a[2] - x` is an element of `assigned`, `can_form` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
