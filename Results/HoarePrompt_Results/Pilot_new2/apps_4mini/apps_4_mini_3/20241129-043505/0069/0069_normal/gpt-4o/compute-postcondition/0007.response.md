The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `index` is currently 1. This means that `x` will take the integer value from the second element of the `data` list (since `index + 1` equals 2). The values of `T`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged, but `x` is now defined based on the input from `data`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer extracted from `data[1]`, `x` is int(data[2])**.
