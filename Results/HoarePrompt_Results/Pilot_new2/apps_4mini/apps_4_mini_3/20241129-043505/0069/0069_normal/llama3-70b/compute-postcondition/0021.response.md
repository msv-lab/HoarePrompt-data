The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1`, but it does not change any of the variables or states in the initial condition. Therefore, all initial state variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and 100000, `x` is an input integer between -10^9 and 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is equal to the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is equal to the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`.**
