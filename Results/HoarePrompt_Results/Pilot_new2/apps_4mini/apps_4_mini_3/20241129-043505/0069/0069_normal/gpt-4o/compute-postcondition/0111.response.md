According to the code, the loop executes for each element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute at least once, `results` must contain at least one element. The variable `index` is calculated as `3 * T + 1`, which means it will always be a positive integer since `T` is between 1 and 100. 

However, the state of `results` is crucial for the loop to run. If `results` is an empty list, the loop won't execute at all. Therefore, for the loop to be executed and for `result` to have a valid value during the first iteration, `results` must contain at least one element.

Additionally, we know that `T` is an integer between 1 and 100 and thus `index` is already determined based on the value of `T`.

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is equal to `3 * T + 1`, `results` must contain at least 1 element**
