The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 1, so the new value of `count` will be 2. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `count` is 2.
