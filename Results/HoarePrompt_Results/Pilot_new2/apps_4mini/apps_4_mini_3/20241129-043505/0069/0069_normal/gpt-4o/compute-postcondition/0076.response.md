The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The variable `index` can either be 8 or `n + 8`, depending on the value of `balance`. Therefore, the value of `n` is determined by the integer conversion of the element in `data` at the position specified by `index`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 8 or `n + 8`, depending on the value of `balance`, `results` is now a list that must still meet the conditions imposed by the last iteration, `n` is now equal to `int(data[index])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `s` is equal to `data[7]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`**.
