Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 12 or `n + 12`, `results` is a list that still meets the conditions imposed by the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` must contain at least `n + 2` elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, if the difference between `x` and `b` is divisible by `balance`, and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is increased to at least 3.***
