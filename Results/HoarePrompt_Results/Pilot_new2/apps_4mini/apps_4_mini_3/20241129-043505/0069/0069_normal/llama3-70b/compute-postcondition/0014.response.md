Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `x` is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, then the condition is satisfied. If `balance` does not equal `x`, and if `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `result` is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
