The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters explicitly. It processes multiple test cases internally, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. The constraints for these parameters are: `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9; and `s` is a binary string consisting only of '0' and '1'. The total length of all strings `s` across the test cases does not exceed 10^5. 

The function's output is not specified in the provided details; therefore, I cannot determine the specific return values or their conditions. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases involving an integer n, an integer x, and a binary string s, but does not accept parameters directly and outputs results based on the test cases defined within the function.**
