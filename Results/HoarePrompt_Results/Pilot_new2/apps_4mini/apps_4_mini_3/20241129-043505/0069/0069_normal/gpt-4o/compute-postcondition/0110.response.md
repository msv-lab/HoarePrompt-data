Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is equal to `3 * T + 1`, `results` is a list containing the results of all iterations based on the calculations performed, where each element corresponds to either -1, 0, or the count of valid updates calculated in its respective iteration. For each iteration, `n` is an integer extracted from `data`, `x` is an integer extracted from `data`, `s` is a binary string extracted from `data`, and `prefix_balances` is a list containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's for each substring of `s` up to its respective length. The final values of `balance` for each iteration will depend on the counts of '0's and '1's in each respective string `s`.**
