According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop is set to execute while `i` is in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. After incrementing, `i` will become 2. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 to satisfy the condition of the range.

Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `T` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop iteration.
- `index` will remain either 11 or `n + 11`.
- `results` continues to meet the conditions imposed by the last iteration.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- The values of `x` and `s` remain unchanged since they depend on `data[index + 1]` and `data[index + 2]`, respectively.
- `prefix_balances` will be updated according to the logic given in the loop body.
- `balance` is calculated based on the updated `s`.
- `i` is now 2.

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 11 or `n + 11`, `results` is a list that still meets the conditions imposed by the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` is updated at index `i` to be `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1` if `s[i - 1]` is '0' or `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1` if `s[i - 1]` is '1', `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `i` is 2**
