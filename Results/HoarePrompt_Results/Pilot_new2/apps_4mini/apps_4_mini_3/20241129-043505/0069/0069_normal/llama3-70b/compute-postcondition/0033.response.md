Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and 100000, `x` is an input integer between -10^9 and 10^9, `s` is the binary string input, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the result printed is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
