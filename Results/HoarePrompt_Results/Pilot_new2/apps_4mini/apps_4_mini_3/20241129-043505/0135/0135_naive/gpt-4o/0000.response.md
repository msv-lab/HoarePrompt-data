To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the function `func_1`.

The problem states that we need to check if all remainders when `n` is divided by each integer from `1` to `k` are distinct. 

The program checks the following:
1. If `k >= n`, it returns 'No'. This is correct because when `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders for `1` and `n` will be the same, resulting in a non-distinct pair.
2. It uses a set called `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders as it iterates through all integers from `1` to `k`.
3. For each integer `i`, it calculates `remainder = n % i`. If this remainder has already been seen (exists in `seen_remainders`), it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it adds the new remainder to the set.
4. If it completes the loop without finding duplicate remainders, it returns 'Yes'.

Now, let's examine potential edge cases where the program might fail:
- When `n` is `1`, it will return 'No' for any `k >= 1` since `1 % 1 = 0`, and if `k` is `1`, it will check only `1` and return 'Yes'. This seems correct.
- For `k < n`, we are assuming that the loop covers all necessary cases, but we should check what happens specifically for the cases where `k` is less than `n`.

Let's consider the following case:
- If `n = 6` and `k = 5`, the remainders would be:
    - `6 % 1 = 0`
    - `6 % 2 = 0`
    - `6 % 3 = 0`
    - `6 % 4 = 2`
    - `6 % 5 = 1`
  
  Here, `0` is repeated for both `1` and `2`, so the expected output should be 'No'. The output of the program is correct in this case.

The program accounts for various scenarios and checks remainders properly using a set for distinctness. 

After reviewing the logic and considering edge cases, I do not find any input cases where the program fails to meet the requirements stipulated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
