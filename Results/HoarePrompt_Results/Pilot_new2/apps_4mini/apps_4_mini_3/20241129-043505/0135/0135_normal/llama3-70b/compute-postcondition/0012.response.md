The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. No variables are modified or returned since the execution halts at this point. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program has stopped executing without making any changes to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `seen` is a set that includes the value of `remainder` and 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2, and 'No' is printed; the program has exited.**
