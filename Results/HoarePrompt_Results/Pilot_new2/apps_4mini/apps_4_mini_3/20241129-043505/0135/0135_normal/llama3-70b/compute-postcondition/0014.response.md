The value of `remainder` is added to the `seen` set. Since `seen` already includes `remainder` and 0, if `remainder` was already in `seen`, then the program would have printed 'No' and exited before this line of code. However, as the code is executing this line, it indicates that `remainder` is not already in `seen`. 

Thus, the `seen` set now includes the value of `remainder`, but other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` is now a set including the values of `remainder` and 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is `n % 2`.**
