The provided program aims to check if all the remainders of the division of a number \( n \) by all integers from 1 to \( k \) are distinct. The program does this by iterating through each integer \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( k \), calculating the remainder \( n \mod i \), and storing these remainders in a set to ensure they are unique.

However, there is a significant flaw in the program's logic that makes it incorrect. The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is greater than \( n \) appropriately. 

When \( k > n \), the remainders for \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) will be distinct (since \( n \mod i \) is simply \( n \) for \( i = n \)). However, for \( i > n \), the value of \( n \mod i \) will always be \( n \) because \( n \) is less than \( i \). This means that when \( k > n \), there will be duplicate remainders (specifically, \( n \) for each \( i \) from \( n+1 \) to \( k \)), which violates the requirement that all remainders must be distinct.

For example, if \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 10 \), the program will compute the distinct remainders for \( i = 1 \) to \( 5 \) (which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), and then for \( i = 6 \) to \( 10 \) it will compute \( 5 \) for each of those values, leading to non-distinct remainders.

So, in cases where \( k \) exceeds \( n \), the program will incorrectly return "Yes" instead of "No" because the logic fails to account for the non-distinct remainders.

Correctness: **False**
