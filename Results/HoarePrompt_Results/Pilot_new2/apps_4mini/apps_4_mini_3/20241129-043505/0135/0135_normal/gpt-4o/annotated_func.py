        #The program returns 'No' since k is greater than or equal to n, where both n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`, `i` is equal to `k`, and `seen_remainders` contains all unique values of `n % i` for `i` in the range from 1 to `k`. If no remainder was repeated, the loop has executed `k` times; otherwise, it has terminated early.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders from the division of n by i, for i in the range from 1 to k, were unique, and the loop executed k times without repetition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any remainder from the division of `n` by integers from 1 to `k` has been seen before; otherwise, it returns 'Yes' if all remainders are unique. If `k` is less than `n`, the function checks for unique remainders in the range from 1 to `k`. The conditions where the function may return 'No' are based on the values of both `k` and the remainders seen during the loop.
