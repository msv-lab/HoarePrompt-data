The code `seen_remainders.add(remainder)` adds the current value of `remainder` to the set `seen_remainders`. Since the initial state indicates that `seen_remainders` is an empty set and `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`, this operation will successfully add `remainder` to the set.

No other variables are affected by this operation, so we retain their current states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` now contains `remainder`, `remainder` is 0, and the value of `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`.**
