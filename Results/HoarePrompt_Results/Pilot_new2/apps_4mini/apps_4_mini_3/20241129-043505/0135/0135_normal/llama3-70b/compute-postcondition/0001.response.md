The variable `seen` is assigned an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as this operation only affects the variable `seen`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, and `seen` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, `seen` is an empty set**.
