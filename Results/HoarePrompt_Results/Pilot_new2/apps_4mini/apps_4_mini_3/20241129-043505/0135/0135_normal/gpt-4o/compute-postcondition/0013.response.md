Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` < `n`, and `i` is 2. If `remainder` (which is `n % 2`) is found in `seen_remainders`, the program returns the string 'No'. If `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`, no action is taken and the program continues.***
