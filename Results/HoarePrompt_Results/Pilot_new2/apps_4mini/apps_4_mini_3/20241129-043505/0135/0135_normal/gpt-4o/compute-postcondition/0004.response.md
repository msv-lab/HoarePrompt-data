According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, inclusive. Given that `k` is less than `n` and both are integers within the specified range, the key factor for executing the loop is that `k` must be at least 1. Since `k` is an integer and defined to be less than `n`, it is guaranteed to be positive in this case. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 1 for the first iteration. The `seen_remainders` set will remain empty at the beginning of the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
