To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its behavior based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Two integers, `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`.
2. **Task**: Check if all the remainders of `n` divided by every integer from `1` to `k` are distinct.
3. **Distinct Check**: Specifically, we need to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n % i == n % j`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
seen = set()
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    remainder = n % i
    if remainder in seen:
        print('No')
        exit()
    seen.add(remainder)
print('Yes')
```

### Program Logic:
1. The program initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of remainders.
2. It iterates over all integers `i` from `1` to `k`.
3. For each integer `i`, it calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by `i`.
4. The program checks if this remainder is already in the `seen` set:
   - If true, it prints 'No' and exits, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If false, it adds the remainder to the `seen` set.
5. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it prints 'Yes'.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Loop Behavior for Large `k`**: For large values of `k` (close to `10^18`), the loop iterates potentially up to `k` times. However, the actual distinct remainders can only be `0` to `n-1` at most, meaning:
   - If `k > n`, there will be guaranteed duplicates because `n % i` for `i > n` will always yield a remainder of `n`. 
   - If `k == n`, `n % n = 0` and `n % 1 = 0` also creates a duplicate.
   - If `k < n`, we can still have situations where the same remainder appears for different values of `i`.

### Counterexample:
Consider `n = 10` and `k = 12`:
- The remainders would be:
  - `10 % 1 = 0`
  - `10 % 2 = 0`
  - `10 % 3 = 1`
  - `10 % 4 = 2`
  - `10 % 5 = 0`
  - `10 % 6 = 4`
  - `10 % 7 = 3`
  - `10 % 8 = 2`
  - `10 % 9 = 1`
  - `10 % 10 = 0`
  - `10 % 11 = 10`
  - `10 % 12 = 10`
  
In this case, we would find duplicates (0 appears for i=1, 2, and 5), which means the program should return 'No'. However, the program does not account for the fact that if `k` exceeds `n`, duplicates are guaranteed, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly assess the distinctness of remainders when `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
