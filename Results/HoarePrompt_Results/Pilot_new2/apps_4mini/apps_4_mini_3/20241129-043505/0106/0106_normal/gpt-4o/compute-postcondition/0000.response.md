To simulate the execution of the provided code snippet, we analyze the variables and how they are affected. 

- We know that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers such that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`.
- The code calculates the value of `block`, which is determined by the expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

Now, the output of the calculation depends on the value of `apartment`. Since it is not defined in the initial state, we can only express `block` in terms of `apartment`.

Thus, the output state will maintain the precondition about `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, while updating the value of `block`. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
