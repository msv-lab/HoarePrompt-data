In this case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are overwritten, but the conditions for the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input values; a and b are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.**
