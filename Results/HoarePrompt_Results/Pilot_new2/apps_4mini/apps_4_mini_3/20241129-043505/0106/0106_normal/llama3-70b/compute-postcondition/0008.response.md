The variable `min_floor_time` is assigned the value computed by the expression `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given that `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, the value of `(a_floor - b_floor)` is positive. Therefore, `min_floor_time` becomes a positive value based on the difference between `a_floor` and `b_floor`. 

The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values; `a` and `b` are distinct integers assigned from input values satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `a_floor` is equal to (a - 1) % m + 1, where 1 ≤ a_floor ≤ m; `a_block` is equal to (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is equal to (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is equal to min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is equal to (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
