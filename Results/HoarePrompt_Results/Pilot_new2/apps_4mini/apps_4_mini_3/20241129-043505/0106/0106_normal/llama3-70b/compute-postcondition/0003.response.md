The variable `a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `a` is an integer in the range from 1 to `n·m·k`, and `m` and `k` are also integers, which means `m * k` is a positive integer. This implies that `a - 1` is non-negative, and the integer division `(a - 1) // (m * k)` gives the block number for `a`. 

Therefore, `a_block` represents the block in which `a` lies based on the dimensions of `m` and `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `a_floor` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the assignment to `a_block`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input values; `a`, `b` are distinct integers assigned from input values satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`, where `1 ≤ a_floor ≤ m`; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
