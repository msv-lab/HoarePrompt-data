To derive the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet based on the initial state of the variables. 

The initial state has the following key variables:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values.
- `a` and `b` are distinct integers assigned from input values satisfying `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k`.
- `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`, where `1 ≤ a_floor ≤ m`.
- `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
- `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

The code computes `min_block_time` as follows:
```python
min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
```

Now let's analyze what happens:
1. `abs(a_block - b_block)` calculates the absolute difference between the blocks of `a` and `b`.
2. `n - abs(a_block - b_block)` calculates the distance in the opposite direction, wrapping around the blocks.
3. `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block))` finds the minimum of these two values.
4. This minimum value is then multiplied by `15` to get `min_block_time`.

The variables `min_block_time`, `a_block`, and `b_block` are now defined based on the calculations above, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values; `a`, `b` are distinct integers assigned from input values satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `a_floor` is equal to (a - 1) % m + 1, where 1 ≤ a_floor ≤ m; `a_block` is equal to (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is equal to (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is equal to min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15.**
