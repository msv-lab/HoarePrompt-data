`floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range specified, and `apartment` can be any integer value between `1` and `n·m·k`. Therefore, `floor_within_block` will represent the remainder of the integer division of `(apartment - 1)` by the product of `m` and `k`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.**
