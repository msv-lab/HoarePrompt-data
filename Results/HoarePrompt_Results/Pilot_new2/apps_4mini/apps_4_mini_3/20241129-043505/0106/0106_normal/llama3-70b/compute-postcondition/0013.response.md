The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with values ranging from 1 to 1000, and that `a` and `b` are distinct integers constrained between 1 and `n·m·k`. 

The functionality of the function is likely dependent on these values, but since no specific output behavior is described or provided, we cannot detail any return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to operate within the defined constraints on `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that n, m, and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and a, b are distinct integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k). The function does not directly accept parameters.**
