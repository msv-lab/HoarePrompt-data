Functionality: ** The function calculates the minimum time needed for two distinct integers `a` and `b` to reach each other based on their positions calculated using the inputs `n`, `m`, and `k`. The function does not accept parameters directly but reads them from input. It computes the block and floor of both integers and considers the horizontal and vertical distance between them to determine the total time, which is then printed. It handles cases where `a` and `b` are at different floors and blocks, and always adds a base time of 10 minutes for the initial movement. **
