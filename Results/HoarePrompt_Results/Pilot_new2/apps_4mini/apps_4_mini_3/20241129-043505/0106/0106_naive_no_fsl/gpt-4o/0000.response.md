To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code against the problem description and consider various potential cases that could reveal flaws in the logic.

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Input Parameters**: 
   - `n`: Number of blocks (entrances)
   - `m`: Number of floors per block
   - `k`: Number of apartments per floor
   - `a`: Apartment number where Edward lives
   - `b`: Apartment number where Natasha lives

2. **Location Calculation**:
   - The function `get_location` computes the block and floor of any given apartment based on the formula described in the problem.

3. **Travel Time Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the time for Edward to exit his apartment:
     - If Edward is already on the first floor, the exit time is 0.
     - If he is on a higher floor, it takes 10 seconds to wait for the elevator and then the time to descend the floors (1 second per floor).
   - The program computes two possible walking times to reach Natasha:
     - Direct walking time
     - Reverse walking time
   - It then selects the minimum walking time.
   - Finally, it adds the time needed to reach Natasha's floor.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Same Floor, Different Blocks**: 
   - For example, if Edward is in apartment 1 (block 1, floor 1) and Natasha is in apartment 2 (block 1, floor 1), the expected time should be 0, but that specific case may not be correctly handled as the `time_to_exit` assumes he is on a floor greater than 1.

2. **Different Floors in the Same Block**:
   - If Edward is on the 10th floor of block 1 and Natasha is on the 1st floor of block 1, the calculation must ensure he does not count block walking time unnecessarily.

3. **Edge case at the block boundaries**:
   - For instance, moving from the last block back to the first block, the calculations could potentially miscalculate the time if not handled modulo `n`.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1 (Same Block, Same Floor)**:
  - Input: `1 1 1`, `1 2`
  - This should ideally return `0` seconds since they are on the same floor. However, the current implementation will cause an error or will return incorrect time due to how `block_a` and `block_b` are calculated.

- **Case 2 (Different Floors, Same Block)**:
  - Input: `1 2 2`, `2 1`
  - Expected output: `5` seconds (since he's on the 2nd floor and needs to go to the 1st), should be checked if the implementation correctly calculates this.

Given the observed issues and potential miscalculations in the handling of cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not handle all edge cases as per the problem description. It fails, for instance, when both individuals are on the same floor in the same block, leading to a miscalculation of time. Other cases may also reveal flaws, indicating that the logic is not robust enough to handle all specified scenarios correctly.
