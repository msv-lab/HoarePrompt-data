To verify the correctness of the given Python program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1`.

1. **Understanding the get_location function**: 
   - It calculates the block (entrance) and the floor based on the apartment number. The formula used seems to correctly convert the apartment number into its corresponding entrance and floor.

2. **Calculating time to exit**:
   - If Edward is on the first floor (`floor_a == 1`), the time to exit is `0`. Otherwise, it calculates the time to take the elevator down, which includes a 10-second wait and 1 second for each floor he descends. This part seems correct.

3. **Calculating the walking time**:
   - The program calculates both direct and reverse walking times to get to Natasha's entrance. It uses modulo operations to account for the circular nature of the building. However, the walking time calculation lacks consideration of the scenario where `block_a` equals `block_b`. In such cases, if they are on the same floor, no walking time should be added since Edward can reach Natasha instantly.

4. **Calculating time to reach target floor**:
   - The time to reach Natasha's floor is calculated correctly as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

5. **Total time calculation**:
   - The total time is the sum of the time to exit, the minimum walking time, and the time to reach the target floor. 

### Potential Case of Incorrectness:
- Consider the case where Edward lives in apartment 1 (entrance 1, floor 1) and Natasha lives in apartment 2 (entrance 1, floor 1). 
  - Here, `block_a` equals `block_b` and `floor_a` equals `floor_b`. The expected time should be `0` since Edward is already at Natasha's apartment. 
  - However, the current logic would still compute a walking time (both direct and reverse) which may lead to a non-zero result erroneously. 

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not account for the situation where both Edward and Natasha are on the same floor of the same entrance, leading to a potential incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**.
