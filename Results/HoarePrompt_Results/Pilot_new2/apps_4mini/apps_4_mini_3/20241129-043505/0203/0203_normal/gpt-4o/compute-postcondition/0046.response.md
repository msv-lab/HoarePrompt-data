The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string `votes` consisting of characters 'D' (for depublicans) and 'R' (for remocrats). It processes these votes to determine which party has more influence based on the order of the votes. The function simulates a matchup where the indices of 'D' votes and 'R' votes are compared, with the losing party's index being pushed to the end of a cycle (i.e., after `n` positions). 

If there are unpaired 'D' votes remaining in `d_queue`, it prints 'D', indicating the depublicans won. Conversely, if there are unpaired 'R' votes left in `r_queue`, it prints 'R', indicating the remocrats won. 

The function does not handle cases where the input is malformed or does not conform to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters, simulates a cyclic matchup between the votes, and prints 'D' if depublicans win or 'R' if remocrats win based on the remaining unmatched votes. **
