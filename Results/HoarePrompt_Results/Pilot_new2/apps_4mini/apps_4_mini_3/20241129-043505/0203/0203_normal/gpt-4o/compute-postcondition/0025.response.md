The value of `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation, and `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The operation `r_queue.append(r_index + n)` adds a new element to `r_queue`, which is the sum of `r_index` and `n`. The previous states of `d_queue` and `r_queue` indicate that both have one less index than before, but these collections are not altered by the operation performed on `r_queue`. The value of `d_index` remains greater than or equal to `r_index`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` now has one less index; `r_queue` has one more index with the last element being `r_index + n`; `r_index` is the value of the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation; `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.**
