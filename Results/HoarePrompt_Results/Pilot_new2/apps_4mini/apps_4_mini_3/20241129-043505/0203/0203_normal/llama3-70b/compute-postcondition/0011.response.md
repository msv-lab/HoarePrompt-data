The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `depublicans` is unknown, but it is assumed to be an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n + 1` consisting only of 'D' and 'R', `fraction` is the second character in the string, and `depublicans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n + 1` consisting only of 'D' and 'R', `fraction` is the second character in the string, `depublicans` is increased by 1.**
