The value of `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element from the `d_queue`, which is accessed using the `pop(0)` method, effectively removing that element from `d_queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` has one less index; `r_queue` must have at least one index; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` has one less index; `r_queue` must have at least one index; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.**
