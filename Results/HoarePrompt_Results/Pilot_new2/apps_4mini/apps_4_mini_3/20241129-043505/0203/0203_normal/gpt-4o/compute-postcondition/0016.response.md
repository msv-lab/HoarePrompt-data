The line `r_queue.append(i)` adds the current index `i` to the list `r_queue`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the conditions about `votes` and `d_queue` or `r_queue` remain unchanged, except for the modification of `r_queue` to include the current value of `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is the current index; `votes` must have a length greater than `i`; if `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` includes the current value of `i`; `r_queue` now includes the value of `i`.**
