The code initializes `r_queue` as an empty list. The values of `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state, with the only change being the addition of the variable `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.**
