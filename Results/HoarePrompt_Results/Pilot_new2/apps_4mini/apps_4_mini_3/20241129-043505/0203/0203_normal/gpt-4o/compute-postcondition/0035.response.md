The value of `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue`, as the `pop(0)` method removes and returns that element. The initial state indicates that `r_queue` has at least one element, so after this operation, `r_queue` will have one less element. The value of `d_index` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` has one less element; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue` before the pop operation; `r_queue` has one less element and `r_index` is the element that was at index 0 of `r_queue` before the pop operation.**
