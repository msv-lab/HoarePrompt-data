According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `fractions` string. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), the string `fractions` will contain at least 1 character, which ensures that the loop can execute at least once.

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `fraction` will take on the value of the first character in the `fractions` string. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `fractions` must be a string of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R'.
- `fraction` is the first character of the `fractions` string, which can either be 'D' or 'R'.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of the string `fractions`**
