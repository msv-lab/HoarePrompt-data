The code appends the result of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The value of `d_index` is retained from the initial state, and `n` is an integer within the specified range. This operation changes `d_queue` by adding an element to it, but does not affect the other variables.

The output state will reflect the new value in `d_queue` and retain the previous values of the unaffected variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` has one more element, the last element is `d_index + n`; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue` before the pop operation; `r_queue` has one less element; `r_index` is the element that was at index 0 of `r_queue` before the pop operation.**
