The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables, `n` and `fractions`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n + 1`, and `depublicans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n + 1`, `depublicans` is increased by 1.**
