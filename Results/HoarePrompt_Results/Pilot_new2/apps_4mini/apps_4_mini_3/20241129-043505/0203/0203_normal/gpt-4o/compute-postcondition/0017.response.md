Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is the current index; `votes` must have a length greater than `i`. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` includes the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `d_queue` includes the current value of `i` if `v` is 'D', and `r_queue` now includes the value of `i`.***
