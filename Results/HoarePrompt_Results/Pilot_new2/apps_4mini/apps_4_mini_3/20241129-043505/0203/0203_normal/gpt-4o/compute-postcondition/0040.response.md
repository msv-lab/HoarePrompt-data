Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` contain indices that could not be matched, with `d_queue` and `r_queue` potentially containing indices that are greater than their original values by multiples of `n`. One of the queues is empty, while the other may contain indices that are greater than or equal to the initial indices. The queue `d_queue` is not empty.***
