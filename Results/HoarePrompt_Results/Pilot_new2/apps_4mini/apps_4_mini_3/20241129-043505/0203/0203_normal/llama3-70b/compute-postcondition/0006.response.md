The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `fractions`, `remocrats`, and `fraction` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is now 1, `remocrats` is 0, and the current value of `fraction` is 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, and the current value of `fraction` is 'D'**.
