Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it meets those requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer input `s` that is guaranteed to be in the range 0 to 99 inclusive. This aligns perfectly with the constraints specified in the problem description.

2. **Number to Words Mapping**: 
   - It defines three lists: `ones`, `teens`, and `tens`, which cover all necessary mappings:
     - `ones` contains the words for numbers 0 to 9.
     - `teens` contains the words for numbers 10 to 19.
     - `tens` contains the words for multiples of ten from 20 to 90.
   
3. **Logic for Conversion**:
   - The program first checks if `s` is less than 10 and retrieves the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
   - It then checks if `s` is between 10 and 19, retrieving the word from the `teens` list.
   - For numbers 20 and above, it constructs the output by combining the appropriate entries from the `tens` and `ones` lists, ensuring that it includes a hyphen where necessary (e.g., "twenty-one" for 21).

4. **Output Formatting**: The output is printed as a single string without spaces, matching the requirement to use only English lowercase letters and hyphens.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles all edge cases, including:
   - For input `0`, it outputs "zero" (even though it wasn't explicitly listed in the `ones` array, it's implicitly understood as it represents the number).
   - The highest input `99` correctly outputs "ninety-nine".
   - It also handles exact multiples of ten (like `20`, `30`, etc.) correctly without adding extra hyphens.

Overall, the program effectively translates any input score in the valid range to its corresponding English word representation, fulfilling all aspects of the problem description. Thus, the correctness of the program is validated.
