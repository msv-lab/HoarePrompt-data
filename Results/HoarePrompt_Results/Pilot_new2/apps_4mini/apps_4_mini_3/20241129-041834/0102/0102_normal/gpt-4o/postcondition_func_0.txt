The function accepts an integer `n` (where 0 ≤ n ≤ 99) and returns its English word representation. It covers the following cases: it returns 'zero' through 'nine' for values 0-9; 'eleven' through 'nineteen' for values 11-19; for multiples of ten from 10 to 90 it returns 'ten', 'twenty', etc.; and for other numbers between 10 and 99 it returns a combination of the tens and ones place (e.g., 'twenty-one'). The function does not handle the case for the number 10, which is missing from the logic, as it falls under the teens and should return 'ten' instead of being omitted.
