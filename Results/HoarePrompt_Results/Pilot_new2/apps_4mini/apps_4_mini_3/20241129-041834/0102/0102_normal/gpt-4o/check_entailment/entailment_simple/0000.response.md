The provided program is intended to convert an integer score (between 0 and 99 inclusive) into its corresponding English word representation. Let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Handling numbers from 0 to 9**: The program has a list `ones` that correctly maps the integers from 0 to 9 to their respective English word forms. If the input `n` falls within this range, it returns the correct English word.

2. **Handling numbers from 11 to 19**: The program has a list `teens` that correctly maps the integers from 11 to 19 (with `teens[n - 10]` used to access the correct word). It handles all numbers in this range correctly.

3. **Handling multiples of 10 from 10 to 90**: The program has a list `tens` that correctly maps multiples of ten from 10 to 90. If `n` is a multiple of ten, it returns the correct word from the `tens` list.

4. **Handling numbers from 21 to 99 that are not multiples of ten**: The program correctly constructs the English word representation by concatenating the appropriate entries from `tens` and `ones` with a hyphen in between.

5. **Coverage of all possible inputs**: Since the function checks for all possible ranges of values from 0 to 99 (inclusive), it has proper checks for each required category of numbers. The structure of the function ensures that every integer within the specified bounds of the problem description gets processed correctly.

6. **Output Format**: The function outputs a single string consisting only of English lowercase letters and hyphens, as required.

Given all these points, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
