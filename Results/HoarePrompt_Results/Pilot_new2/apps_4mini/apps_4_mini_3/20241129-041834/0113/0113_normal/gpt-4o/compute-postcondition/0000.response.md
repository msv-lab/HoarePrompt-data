The value of `multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 8, `multiplier` can take values from `1` (when `k = 0`) to `100000000` (when `k = 8`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `multiplier` is equal to `10 ** k`.**
