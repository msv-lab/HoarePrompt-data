The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input received from the user. `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 8. The previous states of `n` and `k` will be replaced by the new values obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8.**
