According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `n % x != 0`. For the loop to execute, `n` must not be divisible by `x`. Given that `x` is equal to 10, this means that for the loop to execute, `n` must not be a multiple of 10. 

Since `n` is an input positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, it can take values that are either multiples of 10 or not. The state indicates that `n` could either be a multiple of 10 or not, but we need to ensure that it is specifically a value that is not divisible by 10 for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is not a multiple of 10. 

State: **`n` must not be a multiple of 10, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, `x` is equal to 10**
