According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is not a multiple of `x` (which is 10). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n + 1`, and since `n` is not a multiple of 10, `n + 1` would need to be adjusted to ensure that `n` remains not a multiple of 10 in the next iteration. 

To clarify, if `n` was not a multiple of 10, then `n + 1` will be a multiple of 10 if `n` is one less than a multiple of 10 (e.g., if `n` is 9, then `n + 1` is 10). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted so that `n` is not one less than a multiple of 10. 

Thus, `n` should be adjusted so it is not `9` but can be any number except `9` and must also not be a multiple of `10`. 

State: **`n` is `n + 1` (where `n` is not a multiple of 10) and `n` must not be 9.**
