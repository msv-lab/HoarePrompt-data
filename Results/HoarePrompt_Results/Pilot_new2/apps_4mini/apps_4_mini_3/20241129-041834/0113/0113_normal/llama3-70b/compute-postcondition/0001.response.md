`x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. The value of `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, so `x` will take on values ranging from `1` (when `k` is `0`) to `10000000000` (when `k` is `8`). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `x` is equal to `10 ** k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `x` is equal to `10 ** k`.**
