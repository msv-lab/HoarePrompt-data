To determine the output state after running the provided Python code based on the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact of the code step by step.

1. The variable `dist2` is being assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.
2. The values of `n` and `max_pos` are used in the calculation of `dist2`. 
3. `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`.

Therefore, the value of `dist2` is calculated as follows:
- Since `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list, it can be any integer from 0 to `n-1`. 
- The absolute distance `dist2` will be a non-negative integer calculated based on the formula provided.

No other variables are affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range [1, n]; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`**.
