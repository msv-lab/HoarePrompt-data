The `posn` variable is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100, and the specific value of `n` is relevant for determining the output state. The value of `pos1` is unaffected, and it remains as the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
