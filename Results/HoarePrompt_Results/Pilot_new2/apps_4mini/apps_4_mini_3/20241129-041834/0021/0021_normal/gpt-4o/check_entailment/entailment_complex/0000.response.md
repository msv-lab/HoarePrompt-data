Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requires the program to find the maximum distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) after performing exactly one swap. However, the current implementation of the function merely calculates the distances from the positions of 1 and n to the two ends of the list and takes the maximum of these distances.

Here is the reason why it does not satisfy the problem description:

1. **Ignoring the swap**: The function calculates distances without considering the effect of performing a swap. It should explicitly evaluate the positions of 1 and n after potential swaps, rather than merely calculating distances to the ends of the list.

2. **Incorrect distance calculation**: The calculated maximum distance (`max_distance`) is derived from the absolute differences of the positions of 1 and n to the ends of the list, but this does not reflect the maximum possible distance achievable through a swap.

3. **No logic for determining the best swap**: The program fails to evaluate which specific elements should be swapped to maximize the distance between the positions of 1 and n. The optimal swap must be identified based on the current positions of 1 and n in the given list.

For example, consider the case with input:
```
5
1 3 4 2 5
```
The minimum (1) is at index 0 and the maximum (5) is at index 4. The maximum distance is already 4, but the code only considers swaps with the ends of the list and does not look at swapping 1 with 2 or any other element to try to maximize the distance, which would require the logic as described in the problem statement.

Thus, the logic of the program is fundamentally flawed as it does not take into account the necessary swap to achieve the required maximum distance, leading to incorrect outputs.
