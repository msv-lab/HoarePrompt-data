The operation `min_pos = a.index(1)` assigns the value of the index of the first occurrence of the integer `1` in the list `a` to the variable `min_pos`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this operation. The variable `a` must have `1` as one of its distinct integers since it's specified in the initial state that `a` contains distinct integers between `1` and `n`. Therefore, the output state specifies the value of `min_pos`, which is the index of `1` in the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range [1, n]; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`.**
