Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100); `i` is 2; `s_i` is the third element of `bus_routes[2]`; `d_i` is the fourth element of `bus_routes[2]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0 and `min_wait_time` potentially remains unchanged. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
