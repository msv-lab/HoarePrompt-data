Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the given conditions. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to equal `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to 1.***
