The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The initial conditions state that `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, which implies that `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` will yield a positive integer value since `d_i` is greater than `(t - s_i) % d_i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is less than `t`, (t - s_i) % d_i is not equal to 0, and `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
