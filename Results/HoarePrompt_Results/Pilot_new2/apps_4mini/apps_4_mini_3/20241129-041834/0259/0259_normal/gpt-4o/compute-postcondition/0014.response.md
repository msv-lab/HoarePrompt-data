To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to consider the conditions leading up to the execution of the statement `min_wait_time = wait_time`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100).
- `i` is 0.
- `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`.
- `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`.
- The current value of `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.

Since the code assigns `min_wait_time` the value of `wait_time`, we note that the previous value of `min_wait_time` is replaced by the current value of `wait_time`.

The output state will reflect that `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, while the other variables retain their information because they haven't changed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions, and `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.**
