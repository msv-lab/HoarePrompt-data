To determine the impact of the code, we need to evaluate the calculation of `wait_time` based on the initial state of the variables. The relevant variables are `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`.

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s_i` is the third element of `bus_routes[2]`.
   - `d_i` is the fourth element of `bus_routes[2]`.
   - `wait_time` is calculated using the expression provided.
   
2. **Calculation**:
   - The formula provided is: `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`
   - This means `wait_time` is assigned a new value calculated from the current values of `d_i`, `s_i`, and `t`.

3. **Output State**:
   - The variable `wait_time` is updated based on the calculation.
   - The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `wait_time` based on the calculation, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100); `i` is 2; `s_i` is the third element of `bus_routes[2]`; `d_i` is the fourth element of `bus_routes[2]`; `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
