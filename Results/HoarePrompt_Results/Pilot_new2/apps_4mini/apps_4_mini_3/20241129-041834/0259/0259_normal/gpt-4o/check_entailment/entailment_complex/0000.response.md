Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement by calculating which bus route Serval will take based on the time he arrives at the bus station and the schedule of each bus route.

Here’s a breakdown of how the program aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes in three parameters: the number of bus routes (`n`), the time Serval arrives (`t`), and a list of tuples (`bus_routes`), each containing the first arrival time (`s_i`) and the interval (`d_i`). This matches the structure outlined in the problem description.

2. **Wait Time Calculation**:
   - If the first bus of a route arrives after Serval arrives (`s_i >= t`), the wait time is simply `s_i - t`.
   - If Serval arrives exactly when a bus is scheduled to arrive or if a bus arrives shortly after (`(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), the wait time is `0`, indicating he can board immediately.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates how long Serval has to wait until the next bus arrives by determining the wait time based on the interval between buses (`d_i`).

3. **Choosing the Optimal Bus Route**: The program keeps track of the minimum wait time encountered and updates the `chosen_route` accordingly. If a new route offers a shorter wait time, it updates the `chosen_route` index. This ensures that the route with the earliest bus after or at time `t` is selected, fulfilling the requirement that Serval will take the first bus he sees.

4. **Output**: The function returns `chosen_route`, which is the 1-indexed number of the bus route Serval will take, consistent with the output requirements of the problem.

5. **Edge Cases**: The description notes that if no buses are available, the chosen route should remain as `-1`. However, since the constraints guarantee at least one bus route (`1 ≤ n`), this situation won’t occur in the provided constraints.

Overall, the program accurately models the scenario described in the problem statement and handles the conditions correctly, ensuring that Serval gets on the first available bus based on the given schedules. Therefore, the answer is confirmed to be correct.
