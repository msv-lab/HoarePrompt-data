Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and if the difference (t - s_i) is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The current value of `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.***
