The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The values of other variables (`n`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `min_wait_time`) remain unchanged, and the previous conditions and values related to `wait_time` are not specified, thus they do not affect the output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100); `i` is 2; `s_i` is the third element of `bus_routes[2]`; `d_i` is the fourth element of `bus_routes[2]`; `wait_time` is 0; `min_wait_time` potentially remains unchanged.**
