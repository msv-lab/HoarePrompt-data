`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of buses[0], `d` is the second element of buses[0], `time` is equal to (t - s) % d, `min_time` is equal to `time`, and `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of buses[0], `d` is the second element of buses[0], `time` is equal to (t - s) % d, `min_time` is equal to `time`, `ans` is 1.**
