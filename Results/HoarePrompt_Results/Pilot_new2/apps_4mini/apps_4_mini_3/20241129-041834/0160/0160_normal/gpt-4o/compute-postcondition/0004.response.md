The code `divisors.add(x // i)` adds the value of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The variable `x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), so `x // i` will evaluate to the integer division of the first element of the tuple by `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `x // i` will simply be the first element of `x`, which is N.

Now, since `divisors` initially contains the value 1, after this operation, `divisors` will contain the values 1 and N (if N is not already in the set). 

Thus, the updated state is:
- `divisors` now contains {1, N}

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500); `i` is 1; `divisors` is now a set containing the values 1 and N.**
