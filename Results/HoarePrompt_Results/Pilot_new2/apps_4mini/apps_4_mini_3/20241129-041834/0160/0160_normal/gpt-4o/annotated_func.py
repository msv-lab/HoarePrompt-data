#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list containing two integers N and K followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N, where 2 <= N <= 500, 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for each i, and 0 <= K <= 10^9.
def func_1(lst):
    gcd_result = lst[0]
    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list containing at least 2 integers; `gcd_result` is the greatest common divisor of all integers in `lst` starting from the second integer, `N` must be greater than or equal to 1; `num` is the last integer in the list.
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns gcd_result, which is the greatest common divisor of all integers in lst starting from the second integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` containing at least two integers, where the first integer is used as the initial value for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) with every subsequent integer in the list. It returns the GCD of all integers in `lst`, starting from the second integer onward. If `lst` contains only two integers, it will return the GCD of those two numbers. The function does not handle cases where the input list might not meet the constraints, such as being too short, but based on the provided constraints, it is expected to work correctly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the subsequent elements are a list of N integers A_i (1 <= A_i <= 10^6).
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` is a set containing all unique divisors of `N`, where `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500).
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of the unique divisors of N in descending order, where N is a positive integer between 2 and 500.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `x` containing a positive integer `N` (2 <= N <= 500) and returns a sorted list of the unique divisors of `N` in descending order. The contents of the tuple after the second element (non-negative integer `K` and the list of integers) are not utilized in the function, making them irrelevant to the actual functionality.
