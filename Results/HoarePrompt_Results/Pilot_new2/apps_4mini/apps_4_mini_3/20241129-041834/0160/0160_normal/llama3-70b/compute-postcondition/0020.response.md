The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value or the result of `gcd // i`. The value of `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `i` has been previously incremented by 1. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `max_divisor` or `gcd`, we denote them as `max_divisor` and `gcd` respectively. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated to `max(max_divisor, gcd // i)`, and `i` has been increased by 1.
