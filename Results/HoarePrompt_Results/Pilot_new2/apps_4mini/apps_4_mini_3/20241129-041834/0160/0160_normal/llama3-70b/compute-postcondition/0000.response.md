The values of `N` and `K` are assigned based on the input provided through `map(int, input().split())`, which takes two space-separated integers as input. The list `A` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `N` will now hold the first input integer, and `K` will hold the second input integer.

Output State: **`N` is equal to the first input integer between 2 and 500, `K` is equal to the second input integer which is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, and `A` is a list of N integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6.**
