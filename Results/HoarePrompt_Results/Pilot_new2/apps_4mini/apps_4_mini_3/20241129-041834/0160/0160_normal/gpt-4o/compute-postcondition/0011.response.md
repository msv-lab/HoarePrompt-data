The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. The value of `i` is 3, and we assume `divisors` is a set that already exists. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (4 <= N <= 500), `i` is 3, and `divisors` now includes the value 3.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (4 <= N <= 500), `i` is 3, and `divisors` includes 3.**
