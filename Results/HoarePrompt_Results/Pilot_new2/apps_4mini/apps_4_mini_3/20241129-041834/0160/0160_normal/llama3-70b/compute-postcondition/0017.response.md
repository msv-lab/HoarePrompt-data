Postcondition: ***`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, if `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is either equal to `gcd // i` or remains its previous value, and `i` multiplied by itself is not equal to `gcd`***
