The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a tuple. The first element of the tuple, `N`, is a positive integer that must be between 2 and 500. The second element, `K`, is a non-negative integer that can range from 0 to 10^9. The subsequent elements of the tuple are a list of `N` integers, each denoted as `A_i`, where each `A_i` is an integer that must be between 1 and 10^6.

After executing the function body, the program returns a sorted list of the unique divisors of `N` in descending order.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a tuple `x` consisting of a positive integer `N`, a non-negative integer `K`, and a list of `N` integers, and to return a sorted list of the unique divisors of `N` in descending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple x containing a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and a list of N integers A_i (1 <= A_i <= 10^6), and returns a sorted list of the unique divisors of N in descending order.**
