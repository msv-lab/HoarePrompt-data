Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the requirement to compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after performing the allowed operations. 

For example, consider the following input case:

```
N = 2
K = 1
A = [1, 2]
```

According to the problem description, we can perform operations to potentially alter the elements of A. With K = 1, we can perform one operation where we can choose i = 1 and j = 2. If we add 1 to A[1] and subtract 1 from A[2], the new array A will become:

```
A = [2, 1]
```

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the new array [2, 1] is 1, which means the maximum positive integer that divides every element of A after the operation is 1.

However, the provided code computes the sum of A and attempts to find divisors of that sum, which is incorrect. The actual maximum divisor should be based on the transformed elements of A after considering the operations. 

Thus, the program fails to account for this specific edge case, leading to incorrect outputs for scenarios where K is very limited. As such, it does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case, confirming that the program is incorrect.
