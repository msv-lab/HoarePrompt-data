The value of `b` is assigned the result of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed by using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state specifies that `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, and the leading zeros are stripped from it. The other variables `a` and `data` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed; `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
