The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` in string format, removes any leading zeros, and compares their values. It prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, or '=' if they are equal. If either string is empty after removing leading zeros, it is treated as '0'. The function is designed to handle very large integers represented as strings, up to a length of 10^6 characters.
