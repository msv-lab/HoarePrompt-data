The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's an analysis of how it conforms to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function uses `input().lstrip('0')` to read the input and remove leading zeroes. This is necessary because the problem specifies that the integers can contain leading zeroes. The use of `lstrip('0')` ensures that we accurately compare the numerical values without being affected by these leading zeroes.

2. **Comparison Logic**: After stripping the leading zeroes, the program compares the two strings `a` and `b`. The comparisons are done using standard string comparison:
   - If `a` equals `b`, it prints `=`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it prints `<`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `>`.

3. **Output Conditions**: The output conditions match the problem requirements perfectly:
   - It prints `<` if the first number is smaller.
   - It prints `>` if the first number is larger.
   - It prints `=` if both numbers are equal.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation handles edge cases where both inputs might be zero or contain only leading zeroes. The `lstrip('0')` ensures that multiple leading zeroes do not affect the comparison.

5. **Complexity**: The program is efficient as it reads the inputs in one go and processes them. The use of string comparison in Python is also optimized for such cases.

Since the program adheres to all aspects of the problem description and the logic is correctly implemented to handle all specified cases, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
