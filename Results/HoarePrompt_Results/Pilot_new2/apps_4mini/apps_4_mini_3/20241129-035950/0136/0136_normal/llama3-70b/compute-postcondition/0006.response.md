The code `print('<')` outputs the string '<'. However, it does not change or return any values for the variables involved (`a` and `b`). The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the code simply prints to the console.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, which may be empty if the input was all zeros; `a` is not equal to `b`; the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`; output is '<'.**
