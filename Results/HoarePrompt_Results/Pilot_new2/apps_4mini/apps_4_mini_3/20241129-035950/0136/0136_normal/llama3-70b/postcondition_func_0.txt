The function accepts two non-negative integers represented as strings, compares them after removing any leading zeroes, and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first number is less than the second, or '>' if the first number is greater than the second. It handles cases where the input numbers may have leading zeroes, ensuring accurate comparison. If both inputs are empty strings or consist only of zeroes, they will be treated as equal.
