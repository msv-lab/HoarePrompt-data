The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading zeros. The value of `a` remains unchanged. The output state will now reflect the new value of `b`, which is a non-negative integer but may be an empty string if the input was all zeros.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, which may be empty if the input was all zeros.**
