Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed. If `a` is empty, then `a` is '0'. `b` remains the string representation of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed. The current value of `b` is empty. There is no change to the list `data`, which remains as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.***
