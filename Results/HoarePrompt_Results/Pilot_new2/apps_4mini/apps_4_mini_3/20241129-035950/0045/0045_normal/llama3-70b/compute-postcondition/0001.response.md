The code snippet assigns `b` to `a` and `a % b` to `b`. Given that `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a positive integer, the new values can be calculated as follows: 

1. `b` takes the value of the previous `a`, which is a positive integer `n`.
2. `a` takes the value of `a % b`, which is the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. Since `a` is a positive integer and `b` is also a positive integer, the result of `a % b` will be another positive integer or 0.

Thus, the new values of `a` and `b` depend on the specific values of `n` and `k`. However, we know that `a` after execution will be a value less than `b`, and `b` will be the original value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer less than `k`, `b` is the previous value of `a` (which is a positive integer `n`)**.
