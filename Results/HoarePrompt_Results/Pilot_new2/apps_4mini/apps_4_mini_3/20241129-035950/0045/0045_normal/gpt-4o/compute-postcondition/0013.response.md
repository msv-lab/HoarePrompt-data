According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in the `range` function. The loop is designed to iterate from `k - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been decremented by 1.

Since `i` starts at `k - 1`, and decrements by 1 each iteration, for the next iteration to occur, `i` must be reduced to `-1`. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` would be `0`. 

To allow for one more iteration, we need to set `i` to `-1`, indicating the loop has not completed its full range yet. The values for `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `remainder`, and `d` do not change as they do not depend on the loop index `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n`; `remainder` is equal to -1; `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`; `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is -1**
