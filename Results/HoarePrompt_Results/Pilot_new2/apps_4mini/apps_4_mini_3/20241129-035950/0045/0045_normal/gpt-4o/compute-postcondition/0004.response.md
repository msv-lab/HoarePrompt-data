Given the initial state where `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{10}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{10}\), and `min_sum` is equal to \(k * (k + 1) // 2\) (which is less than or equal to `n`), we analyze the effect of the code snippet:

```
d = n // min_sum
```

Here, `d` is assigned the value of \(n\) divided by `min_sum`, using integer division. Since `min_sum` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `n`, `d` will be a non-negative integer.

The impact of this execution is that `d` will reflect how many full times `min_sum` fits into `n`. 

Therefore, the updated variable `d` will hold the value \(n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)\), while the previous variables `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`; `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`**.
