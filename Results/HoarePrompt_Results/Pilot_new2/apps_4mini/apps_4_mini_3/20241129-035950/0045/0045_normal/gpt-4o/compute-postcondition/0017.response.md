`remainder` is decremented by 1, changing its value from -1 to -2. The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `sequence[i]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `remainder` is -2, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
