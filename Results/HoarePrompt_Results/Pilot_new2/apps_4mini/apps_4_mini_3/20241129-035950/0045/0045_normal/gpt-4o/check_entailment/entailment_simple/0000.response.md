To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program meets all requirements outlined.

### Problem Description Requirements:
1. The function must generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence must be maximal.
3. If no valid sequence can be created, the function should return `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program begins by calculating `min_sum`, which is the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers: `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it correctly returns `-1`, as it is not possible to create a sequence of `k` strictly increasing integers that sum to `n`.
  
- If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the program calculates the quotient `d = n // min_sum`, which represents how many times the minimum sum fits into `n`. This ensures that the sequence starts from the smallest possible strictly increasing integers scaled by `d`.

- The sequence is then initialized as `sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`, creating a sequence of the form `[d * 1, d * 2, ..., d * k]`. This ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and that all numbers are multiples of `d`.

- The program then checks if there is any remainder when subtracting `d * min_sum` from `n`. If there is a remainder, it distributes it among the elements of the sequence by incrementing them one by one, ensuring that the sequence remains strictly increasing.

### Key Points:
- The program ensures that the GCD of the sequence is equal to `d`, which is the maximum GCD achievable, since all elements in the sequence are multiples of `d`.
- It also properly handles the case where a valid sequence cannot be created by returning `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. It constructs a valid strictly increasing sequence of `k` integers that sum to `n` and maximizes the GCD.

Correctness: **True**
