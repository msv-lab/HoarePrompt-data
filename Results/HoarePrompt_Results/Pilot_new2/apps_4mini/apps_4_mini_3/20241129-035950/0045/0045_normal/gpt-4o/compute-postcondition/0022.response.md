Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n`; `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`; `remainder` is -3; `sequence[k - 2]` is incremented by 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `remainder` is 0.**
