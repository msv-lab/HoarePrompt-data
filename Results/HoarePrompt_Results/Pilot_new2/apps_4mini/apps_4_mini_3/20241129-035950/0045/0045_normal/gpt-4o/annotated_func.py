#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, indicating that `min_sum` is greater than `n`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`.
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n`; `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`; `remainder` is equal to the original value of `remainder` minus the number of times the loop executed; `sequence` contains the original values incremented as necessary based on how many times the loop executed; if the loop executed fully, `remainder` is 0.
    return sequence
    #The program returns the sequence containing the original values incremented as necessary based on how many times the loop executed, with remainder being 0 if the loop executed fully.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, and it first computes the minimum required sum (`min_sum`) of the first `k` positive integers. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates how many times `min_sum` can fit into `n` and distributes the remaining value across the first `k` integers to form a sequence. The function returns this sequence of integers, each incremented appropriately based on the remainder.
