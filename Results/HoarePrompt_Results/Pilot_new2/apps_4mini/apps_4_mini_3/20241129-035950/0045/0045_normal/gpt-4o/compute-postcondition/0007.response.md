To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given variables and the loop structure.

1. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `k - 1` and decrements down to 0 (inclusive). For the loop to execute, the starting value of `i` must be valid, which means `k` must be at least 1 because `k - 1` must not be negative.

2. The constraints specify that `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10), so `k` will always be at least 1. This ensures that the loop can start with `i` equal to `k - 1`.

3. Given that `i` starts at `k - 1` and decrements to 0, we do not have to adjust `i` as its initial value is appropriate for the for loop.

4. The other variables (`n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence`) do not directly affect whether the loop can execute since they do not influence the loop's termination condition.

Therefore, the only relevant adjustments to the state are related to `k`:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `remainder` is equal to `n - d * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `sequence` is equal to `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`, `i` is `k - 1`**
