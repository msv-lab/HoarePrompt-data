To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic in relation to the problem description.

The problem requires generating a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum equals n and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized. If such a sequence is not possible, the function should return -1.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program first calculates `min_sum`, which is the minimum sum of the first k positive integers (1 + 2 + ... + k) using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
2. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program immediately returns -1, which is correct since we cannot form a sequence of positive numbers with a sum less than the minimum required.
3. The program calculates `d`, which is the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`. This represents how many times the minimal sequence can be scaled up while still being strictly increasing.
4. A sequence is constructed by multiplying the index values by `d` (`d * (i + 1)`) for each index in the range of k.
5. The program then accounts for any remainder left after scaling the minimum sequence by incrementing elements of the sequence from the back (to ensure it remains strictly increasing) until the remainder is exhausted.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case where k = n**: For instance, if `n = 5` and `k = 5`, the only possible sequence is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which is not strictly increasing. The program should correctly handle this case by returning -1.
- **Case where k > n**: If `k = 6` and `n = 5`, the program should also return -1 since itâ€™s impossible to create such a sequence.
- **General case where n is not enough**: The program should handle cases where `n` is less than the minimum sum calculated.

### Testing:
1. For inputs (5, 3): The minimum sum is 6 (1+2+3). Since 5 < 6, it correctly outputs -1.
2. For inputs (6, 3): The minimum sum is 6 (1+2+3). The program correctly outputs `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. For inputs (8, 2): The minimum sum is 3 (1+2). The program should output `[2, 6]`, which is valid.
4. For inputs (10, 5): The minimum sum is 15 (1+2+3+4+5). Since 10 < 15, it should return -1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the conditions mentioned in the problem description, including edge cases. There are no apparent scenarios in the provided code where it fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
