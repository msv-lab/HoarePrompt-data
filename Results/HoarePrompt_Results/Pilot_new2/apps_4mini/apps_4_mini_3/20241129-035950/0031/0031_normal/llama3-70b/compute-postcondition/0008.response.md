The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The initial value of `denominator` is 2, and `total_days` is also 2. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` becomes 2 * 2 = 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to 2, `numerator` is equal to 2, `denominator` is equal to 4, `i` is 1**
