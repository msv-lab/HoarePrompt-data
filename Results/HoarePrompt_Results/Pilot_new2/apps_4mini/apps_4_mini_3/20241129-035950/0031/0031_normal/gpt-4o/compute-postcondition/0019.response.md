The variable `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The values of `n`, `k`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` are not directly modified by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `p_total` is now equal to `denominator`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `k` is less than or equal to 1 << n; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n; `numerator` is equal to the product of ((2^n) - i) for i from 0 to k-1 modulo 1000003; `denominator` is equal to (total_days^k) % 1000003; `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`; `p_total` is equal to `denominator`.**
