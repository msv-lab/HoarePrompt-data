Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Numerator and Denominator Calculation**: The program calculates the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday using the complementary approach (the probability that all k people have unique birthdays). The numerator is calculated as `total_days - i` for each person i, which builds up the product for unique birthdays. However, the logic for calculating the probability is flawed for cases where `k > total_days`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is greater than `2^n` (the total number of days). According to the birthday paradox, if `k > total_days`, it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, resulting in a probability of 1 (which corresponds to the fraction 1/1). The program incorrectly concludes that the `numerator` becomes 0 when `k >= 3` for `total_days = 2`, which is incorrect; instead, it should recognize that all people must have the same birthday.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program attempts to reduce the fraction using the `gcd` function, but it does this after potentially returning incorrect values for `numerator` and `denominator`.

4. **Return Value**: The output for the case where `k = 3` and `n = 1` (which should yield 1 1) is incorrectly coded; the program returns (0, 1) instead of the correct values.

These issues indicate that the program does not consistently deliver the correct results as per the problem description. Therefore, it is not correct for all specified scenarios.
