    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= gcd
    denominator //= gcd
    return numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)
    #The program returns (0, 1) if k is greater than or equal to 3, or (1, 2) if k equals 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. It calculates `total_days` as `2
