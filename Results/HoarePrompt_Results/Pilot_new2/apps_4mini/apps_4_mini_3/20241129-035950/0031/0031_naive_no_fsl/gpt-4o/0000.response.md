To determine the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, let's analyze the key points in the implementation and the expected behavior based on edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Understanding the Concept**: We need to compute the probability that at least two out of `k` people share a birthday among `2^n` days. This should be outputted as an irreducible fraction `A/B`.

2. **Input Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`
   - `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`

3. **Expected Outputs**:
   - If `k > 2^n`, the output should be `1 1` because it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday (pigeonhole principle).
   - Otherwise, calculate the probability of no shared birthdays (`P(no_shared)`), then derive `P(shared)` and represent it as `A/B`.

### Code Review
- The function `func_1` computes the GCD, which is correctly used to reduce `A` and `B`.
- The main function `func_2`:
   - Handles the case where `k > 2^n` correctly.
   - Uses a loop to calculate the number of favorable outcomes for `k` individuals, handling modular arithmetic properly.
   - Reduces the numerator and denominator by their GCD to ensure they are irreducible before returning the results modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Very Large Values**: Given the constraints of `n` and `k` being as large as `10^18`, the code might encounter overflow issues or inefficiencies. However, Python's integers can handle large values, so we don’t expect an error here but we might see performance issues.
  
2. **Minimum Cases**: When `n = 1` and `k = 2`, there are only 2 days. The output should be `1 1` since both will share a birthday — this case is handled correctly.

3. **Test Case with Just Enough Days**: If `n = 1` and `k = 3`, since `2^1 = 2` and `k = 3`, this should output `1 1` — which is handled correctly.

4. **Edge of Limits**: Testing with `n = 60` (which is `2^60` days) and `k = 61` (which implies `k > 2^n`) should return `1 1`, and the function should logically cover this scenario correctly.

5. **Probability Calculation**: The logic for calculating the numerator and denominator seems correct as it follows the combinatorial logic for counting the ways people can be assigned birthdays.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code against the problem description and considering the edge cases, it appears that the implementation correctly handles all specified scenarios, including edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
