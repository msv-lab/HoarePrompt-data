The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the inputs received from the `input()` function split by spaces. The initial states of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. The value of `s` depends on the input received, which is unspecified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of integers generated from input.**
