The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over a space-separated input string. The input string consists of `m` integers, which will be converted to integers and stored in the list `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of n positive integers parsed from input, `b` is a list of m integers parsed from input.**
