The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by taking input values, splitting them, and converting each value to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. However, the actual values of `colors` depend on the input provided, which can be a series of integers. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n` and `m`, while specifying that `colors` is now a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers derived from input values.**
