Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `counts` is a list of integers derived from input values; `color` is the next color in the list. If `color` is not in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is 0.***
