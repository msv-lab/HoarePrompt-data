Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `right` is 2; `left` is the original value of `left` plus the total number of times the loop executed; `current_counts[color]` must be equal to `desired_counts[color]` for some `color` in `desired_counts`. All values in `current_counts` match their corresponding values in `desired_counts` for every color in `desired_counts`.***
