According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer with the constraint 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 before the first iteration of the loop. 

Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, and other states such as `colors`, `counts`, `color_counts`, and `found` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, they do not need adjustments. 

Thus, the state can be adjusted to indicate the initial value of `i` before the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0**
