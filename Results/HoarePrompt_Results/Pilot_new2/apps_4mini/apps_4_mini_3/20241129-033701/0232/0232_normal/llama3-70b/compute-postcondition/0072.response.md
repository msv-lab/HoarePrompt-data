`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, where `j` is currently 3. The value of `colors` is not provided, but `color` will now be equal to the element at index 3 of the `colors` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 1; `j` is 3; `found` is True; `color` is equal to `colors[3]`; `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
