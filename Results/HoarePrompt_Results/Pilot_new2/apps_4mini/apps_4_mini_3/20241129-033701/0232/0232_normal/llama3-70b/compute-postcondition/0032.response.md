The code assigns the value of `colors[j]` to `color`. The previous value of `j` is 1, so `color` now takes the value of `colors[1]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged, but the value of `color` has been updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `color` is equal to `colors[1]`.**
