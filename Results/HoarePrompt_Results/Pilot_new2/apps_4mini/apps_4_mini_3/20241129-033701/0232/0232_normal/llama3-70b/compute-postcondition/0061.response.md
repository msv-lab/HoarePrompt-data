The code `break` causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or if statement it is currently executing. Since there are no updates to the values of any variables as a result of this code, the output state will only include the existing state of the variables that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `window_counts[color]` is 1; `found` is True; `color` is equal to `colors[1]`; the values of `window_counts` sorted and `counts` match. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
