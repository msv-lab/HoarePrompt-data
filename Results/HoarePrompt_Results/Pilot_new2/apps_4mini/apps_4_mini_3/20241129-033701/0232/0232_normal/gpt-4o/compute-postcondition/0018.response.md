Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `right` is 0, `left` is incremented by 1, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]] + 1`. If the counts of all colors in `current_counts` match the corresponding counts in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions regarding the counts of colors are satisfied.***
