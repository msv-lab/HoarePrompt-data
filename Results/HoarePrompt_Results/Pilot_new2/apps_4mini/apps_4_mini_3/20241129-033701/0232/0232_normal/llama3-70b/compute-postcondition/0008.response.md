The statement `color_counts[color] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `color` in the dictionary `color_counts` by 1. If `color` was not present in `color_counts`, it would have a value of `0` before this operation, and thus it would become `1` after the operation. 

Since `color_counts` is a dictionary that maps colors to their counts, the state of `color_counts` will now reflect the updated count for the specified `color`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `colors`, `counts`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of integers that contains at least 1 element; `counts` is a list of integers derived from input values; if `color` is not in `color_counts`, then `color_counts` will contain the key `color` with a value of either `1` or the previous value plus `1`.**
