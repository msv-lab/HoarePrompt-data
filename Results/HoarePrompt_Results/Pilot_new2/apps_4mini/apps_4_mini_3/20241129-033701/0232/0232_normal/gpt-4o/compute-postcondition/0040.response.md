Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) greater than 1; `right` is 1; `left` is the original value of `left` plus the total number of times the loop executed; `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]` for some `color` in `desired_counts`, indicating that the loop has terminated because not all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]` for every `color` in `desired_counts`.**
