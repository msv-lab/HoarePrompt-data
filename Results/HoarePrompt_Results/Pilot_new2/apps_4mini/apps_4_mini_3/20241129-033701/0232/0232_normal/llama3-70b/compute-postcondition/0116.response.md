The code prints 'YES' if `found` is True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `window_counts` remain unchanged. The `found` variable determines the output message.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `found` is True or False depending on whether matching counts were found; `i` is at most `n - 1`; `j` is at most `n - 1`; `window_counts` contains the counts of unique colors encountered in the `colors` list from index `i` to `n-1`; the output is 'YES' if `found` is True, otherwise it is 'NO'.**
