Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `counts` is a list of integers derived from input values; `color` is the next color in the colors list. If `color` is not already in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is set to 0.***
