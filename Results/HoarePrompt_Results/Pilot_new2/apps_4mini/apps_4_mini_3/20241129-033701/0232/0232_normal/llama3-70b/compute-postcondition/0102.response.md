Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `color` is `colors[3]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the counts of the sorted values in `window_counts` match the target counts, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or statement.***
