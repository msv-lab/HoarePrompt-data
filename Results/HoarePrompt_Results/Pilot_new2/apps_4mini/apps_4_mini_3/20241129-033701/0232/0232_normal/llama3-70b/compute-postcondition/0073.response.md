The value of `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. Prior to this assignment, `window_counts[color]` was incremented by 1, which means it had a value greater than or equal to 1. After the assignment, the value is explicitly set to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 1; `j` is 3; `found` is True; `color` is equal to `colors[3]`; `window_counts[color]` is 0.**
