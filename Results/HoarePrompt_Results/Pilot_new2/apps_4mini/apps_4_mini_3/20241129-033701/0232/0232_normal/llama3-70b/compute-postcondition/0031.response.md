According to the code, the loop will execute again if the value of `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`, which is still true since `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, `j` is 1, and `color` is equal to `colors[0]`.**
