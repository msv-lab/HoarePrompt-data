Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `color` is equal to `colors[2]`; `window_counts[color]` is now 1; `found` remains True. If the counts in `window_counts` match the sorted `counts`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
