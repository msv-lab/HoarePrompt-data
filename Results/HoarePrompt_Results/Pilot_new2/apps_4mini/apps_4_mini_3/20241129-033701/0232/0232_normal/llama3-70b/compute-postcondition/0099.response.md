The value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. Since `color` is `colors[3]`, and if `color` was not in `window_counts`, it was set to 0. After the operation, if `color` was not previously present in `window_counts`, it now has a value of 1. If it was present, its value would have increased by 1. The initial states of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `color` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `color` is `colors[3]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
