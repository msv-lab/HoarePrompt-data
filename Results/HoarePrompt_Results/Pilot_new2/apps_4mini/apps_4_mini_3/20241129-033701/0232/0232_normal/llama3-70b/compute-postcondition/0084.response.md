The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary. The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `found` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The values of those variables retain their previous conditions. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `j` is `n - 1`; `found` is True; `window_counts` is an empty dictionary; and all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
