The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `color` is equal to `colors[1]`, `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or the previous value of `window_counts[color]` plus 1, and `found` is True. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
