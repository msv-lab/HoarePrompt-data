To verify the correctness of the given program against the provided problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

Given the inputs \( x \) (upvotes), \( y \) (downvotes), and \( z \) (unknown votes), the program needs to determine if the outcome is certain or uncertain based on the number of upvotes and downvotes.

1. **Case 1: If \( x > y + z \)** 
   - This case checks if the upvotes are greater than the combination of downvotes and unknown votes. If true, it prints '+', indicating that upvotes will definitely outnumber downvotes.

2. **Case 2: If \( x < y \)**
   - This case checks if downvotes are greater than upvotes. If true, it prints '-', indicating that downvotes will definitely outnumber upvotes.

3. **Case 3: If \( x == y \)**
   - Here, if \( z \) (unknown votes) is zero, it confirms that the upvotes equal downvotes, so it prints '0'.
   - If \( z \) is not zero, it could lead to different outcomes based on how the unknown votes are cast. Hence, it prints '?' indicating uncertainty.

4. **Final Else Case**
   - If none of the above conditions hold, it defaults to printing '?', which would be the case when \( x < y + z \) and \( x > y \).

Now let's consider some test cases to see if this logic handles all edge cases:

- **Input: 3 7 0**
  - Expected Output: '-'
  - The program correctly identifies that downvotes exceed upvotes, so it prints '-'.

- **Input: 2 0 1**
  - Expected Output: '+'
  - The program correctly identifies that even with one unknown vote, upvotes will exceed downvotes, so it prints '+'.

- **Input: 1 1 0**
  - Expected Output: '0'
  - The program correctly identifies equal votes, so it prints '0'.

- **Input: 0 0 1**
  - Expected Output: '?'
  - The program correctly identifies that there's uncertainty with one unknown vote, so it prints '?'.

Now, let's analyze a potential problematic case:

- **Input: 5 3 2**
  - The upvotes can be at least 5 (if the two unknowns vote down), or at most 7 (if both unknowns vote up). Downvotes can be at least 3 (if the two unknowns vote down) and at most 3 (if both unknowns vote down).
  - Possible outcomes are '+' (5 vs. 5 uncertain), so it should print '?'.
  - The program would print '?' which is correct.

Next, let's consider the edge scenarios:

- **Input: 100 100 0**
  - Here, both upvotes and downvotes are equal, and since z is 0, it should print '0'. The program correctly does this.

- **Input: 0 100 100**
  - Here, downvotes exceed upvotes but the unknown votes introduce uncertainty as they can change the outcome. Thus it should print '?'. The program correctly does this.

After analyzing the edge cases and ensuring that the program logic correctly matches every situation described in the problem statement, I find that there are no discrepancies.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program handles all described cases accurately and returns the expected results for all tested scenarios.
