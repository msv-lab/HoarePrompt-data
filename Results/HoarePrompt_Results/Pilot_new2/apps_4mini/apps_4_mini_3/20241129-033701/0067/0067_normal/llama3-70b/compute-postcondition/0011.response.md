The code `print('?')` outputs a string but does not modify any of the integer variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, while the output is printed, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The conditions regarding the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are still valid. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is equal to `y`, and `z` is greater than 0.**
