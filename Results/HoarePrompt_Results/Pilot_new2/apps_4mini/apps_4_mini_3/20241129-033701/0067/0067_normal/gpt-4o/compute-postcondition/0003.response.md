`min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The value of `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, which means `min_downvotes` will also be between 0 and 100. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer between 0 and 100; `z` is an integer between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer between 0 and 100; `z` is an integer between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.**
