The code `print('+')` does not change any variable values; it simply outputs the character '+'. However, since the output state doesn't specify any variable changes, all previously defined states remain valid. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer between 0 and 100; `z` is an integer between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`; the current value of `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`.**
