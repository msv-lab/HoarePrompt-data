Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. The condition for when to print `+` is correct (`if (x > y + z)`), which indicates that upvotes exceed the maximum possible downvotes.
   
2. The program correctly checks if `x < y` and outputs `-` in that case, indicating more downvotes than upvotes.

3. However, there are logical flaws in handling the case when `x` is equal to `y`. The program checks if `z == 0` to print `0`, which is right. But the else clause (`else: print('?')`) is problematic. It does not handle the case when `x == y` correctly, especially when `z > 0`. The program should only print `?` if there is uncertainty, which arises when there are unknown votes that could sway the result.

4. The program fails to check the case where `x` is greater than `y` but less than `y + z`. This condition could also lead to uncertainty because if the unknown votes (z) can tip the balance either way.

For instance, if `x = 2`, `y = 2`, and `z = 1`, the possible scenarios based on the unknown vote could lead to either `+` or `-`, but the program would incorrectly output `?` in this case as well.

The correct flow should account for:
- If `x + z < y`, then always `-`.
- If `x > y + z`, then always `+`.
- If `z > 0` and `x >= y`, there can be uncertainty, thus print `?`.
  
In conclusion, the program fails to cover all scenarios outlined in the problem statement accurately, making it incorrect.
