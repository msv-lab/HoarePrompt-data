Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer between 0 and 100; `z` is an integer between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`.***
