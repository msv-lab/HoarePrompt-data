The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values from the input which will be converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `x`, `y`, and `z` will now hold the specific integer values provided as input, and these integers will be within the range of 0 to 100 according to the initial state.

The other variables remain unaffected, so the output will reflect the new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the input received.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `x`, `y`, `z` are assigned the values from input as integers.**
