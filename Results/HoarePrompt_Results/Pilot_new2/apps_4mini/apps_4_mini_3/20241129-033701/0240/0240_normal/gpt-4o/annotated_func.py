#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty substring of s which may contain leading zeroes.
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `n_len` is equal to `len(s) - len(sub)`, `s_counter` represents the count of digits in `s` after all occurrences of digits in `sub` have been decremented, `sub_counter` remains unchanged, and the characters processed from `sub_counter` are all the unique characters in `sub`.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the minimum value in 'possible_numbers', denoted as 'smallest_number'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, a non-empty string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It calculates the frequency of each digit in `s`, decrements this count based on the characters in `sub`, and constructs a new string `remaining_chars` from the remaining digits in `s`. It then generates a collection of possible numbers using these remaining digits and the substring `sub`, returning the smallest number from this collection. The function does not handle cases where there are no possible numbers generated, which could lead to errors if `possible_numbers` is empty.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string consisting of digits that may contain leading zeroes.
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if 'sub' exists in 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to 'n_len', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two strings, `num_str` and `sub`, and returns True if `sub` exists in `num_str`; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not check the length of `num_str` against any defined length due to the absence of `n_len`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string of digits that may contain leading zeroes.
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty; `perm` is the last permutation of `chars` that was generated; `candidate` is a valid permutation of `chars` that was yielded if it satisfies the validity condition according to `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If no valid permutations exist, no candidates are yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`, and yields all valid permutations of `chars` that satisfy the condition defined by the `is_valid_number` function in relation to `sub`. It does not return a list of possible numbers but rather a generator that yields each valid permutation one at a time. The function handles a maximum length of `chars` up to 1,000,000, but the performance may be impacted due to the large number of permutations generated. If no valid permutations exist, no candidates are yielded.
