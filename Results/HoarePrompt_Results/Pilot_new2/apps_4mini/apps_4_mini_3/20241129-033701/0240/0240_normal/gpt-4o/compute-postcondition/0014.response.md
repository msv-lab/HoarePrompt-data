The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. The parameter `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, while `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that may contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it generates and returns a list of possible numbers formed by inserting the string `sub` into various positions within the string `chars`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `generate_possible_numbers` is to accept a string `chars` of digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits, and return a list of possible numbers created by embedding `sub` within `chars`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `chars` of digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits, returning a list of possible numbers formed by inserting `sub` into `chars`.**
