The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the joined string from the iterable `perm`. The value of `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, so `candidate` becomes a string that is a valid permutation of `chars`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty; `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`; `candidate` is a string equal to the joined value of `perm`, which is a valid permutation of `chars`.**
