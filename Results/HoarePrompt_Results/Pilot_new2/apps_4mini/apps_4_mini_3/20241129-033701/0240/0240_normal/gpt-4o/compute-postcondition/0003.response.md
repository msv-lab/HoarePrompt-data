The code snippet `yield candidate` is used to yield the value of `candidate` as output, without modifying any other variables. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The variable `candidate` is equal to `chars`, which is a string of digits that is not empty. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty; `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`; `candidate` is equal to `chars` and is a valid number. A value of `candidate` has been yielded.**
