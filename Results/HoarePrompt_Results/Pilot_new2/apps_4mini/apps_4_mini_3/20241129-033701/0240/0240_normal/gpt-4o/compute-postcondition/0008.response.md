Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty; `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`; `candidate` is a valid permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, then the function yields the current valid permutation. Otherwise, no changes are made as there is no else part defined in the code.***
