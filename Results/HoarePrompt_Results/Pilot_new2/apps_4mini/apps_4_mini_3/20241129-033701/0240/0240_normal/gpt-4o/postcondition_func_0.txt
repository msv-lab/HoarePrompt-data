The function accepts two parameters, a non-empty string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It calculates the frequency of each digit in `s`, decrements this count based on the characters in `sub`, and constructs a new string `remaining_chars` from the remaining digits in `s`. It then generates a collection of possible numbers using these remaining digits and the substring `sub`, returning the smallest number from this collection. The function does not handle cases where there are no possible numbers generated, which could lead to errors if `possible_numbers` is empty.
