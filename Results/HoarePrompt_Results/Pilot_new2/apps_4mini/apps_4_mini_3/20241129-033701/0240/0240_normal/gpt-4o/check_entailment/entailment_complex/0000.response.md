To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the functionality of each function and their compliance with the requirements set forth in the problem description:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to restore the smallest possible integer `n` from a string `s` which contains digits shuffled with an appended integer `k` (the number of digits in `n`). The substring `sub` is a non-empty substring of `n`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1**: 
     - It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the digits found in `sub`.
     - It then generates possible numbers using these remaining characters and `sub`, returning the minimum.
     - **Issue**: The code does not handle cases where `possible_numbers` is empty, which could lead to an error in finding the minimum. This could happen if the remaining characters do not combine with `sub` to form any valid number.

   - **Function 2**:
     - It checks if `sub` exists in `num_str` and that the length of `num_str` matches some undefined `n_len`.
     - **Issue**: The variable `n_len` is not defined within this function and is referenced incorrectly. This means that the length check is ineffective and could lead to incorrect results.

   - **Function 3**:
     - It generates permutations of `chars` and checks if they satisfy the `is_valid_number` condition.
     - **Performance Issue**: The permutations of a string with a length up to 1,000,000 are computationally infeasible due to the factorial growth of permutations.

3. **Edge Cases**: Considering the edge cases:
   - If `s` contains only `sub` followed by the required digits to complete `n`, the generated permutations may not yield the smallest valid combination due to the potential inefficiency of generating all permutations.
   - The failure to return any valid numbers when there are none leads to unhandled exceptions or incorrect outputs.

4. **Conclusion**: The analysis indicates that the program does not accurately handle all potential cases required by the problem description, particularly with respect to undefined variables, empty outputs from permutations, and performance limitations.

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
The program fails to handle cases where no valid permutations exist, as well as issues with undefined variables leading to incorrect length checks. The performance implications mean that it may not function as expected for the upper limits of input size.
