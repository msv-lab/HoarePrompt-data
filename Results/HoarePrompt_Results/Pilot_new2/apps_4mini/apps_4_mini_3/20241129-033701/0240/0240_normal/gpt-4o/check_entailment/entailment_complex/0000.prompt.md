You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty substring of s which may contain leading zeroes.
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `n_len` is equal to `len(s) - len(sub)`, `s_counter` represents the count of digits in `s` after all occurrences of digits in `sub` have been decremented, `sub_counter` remains unchanged, and the characters processed from `sub_counter` are all the unique characters in `sub`.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the minimum value in 'possible_numbers', denoted as 'smallest_number'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, a non-empty string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It calculates the frequency of each digit in `s`, decrements this count based on the characters in `sub`, and constructs a new string `remaining_chars` from the remaining digits in `s`. It then generates a collection of possible numbers using these remaining digits and the substring `sub`, returning the smallest number from this collection. The function does not handle cases where there are no possible numbers generated, which could lead to errors if `possible_numbers` is empty.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string consisting of digits that may contain leading zeroes.
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if 'sub' exists in 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to 'n_len', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two strings, `num_str` and `sub`, and returns True if `sub` exists in `num_str`; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not check the length of `num_str` against any defined length due to the absence of `n_len`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string of digits that may contain leading zeroes.
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty; `perm` is the last permutation of `chars` that was generated; `candidate` is a valid permutation of `chars` that was yielded if it satisfies the validity condition according to `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If no valid permutations exist, no candidates are yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`, and yields all valid permutations of `chars` that satisfy the condition defined by the `is_valid_number` function in relation to `sub`. It does not return a list of possible numbers but rather a generator that yields each valid permutation one at a time. The function handles a maximum length of `chars` up to 1,000,000, but the performance may be impacted due to the large number of permutations generated. If no valid permutations exist, no candidates are yielded.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
