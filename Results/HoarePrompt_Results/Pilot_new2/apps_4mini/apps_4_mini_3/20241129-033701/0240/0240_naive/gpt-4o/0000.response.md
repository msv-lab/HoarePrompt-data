To verify the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Goal**: Restore the smallest possible integer `n` from a shuffled string `s` and a known substring `sub` of `n`.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The number `n` must not have leading zeros unless it's a single digit "0".
   - The output must be the smallest integer possible that contains the substring `sub` and uses the digits from `s`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program calculates `n_len`, which is the length of `n` by subtracting the length of `sub` from the length of `s`.
- It defines `is_valid_number(num_str, sub)` to check if `sub` is a substring of a candidate number and that the candidate number is of the correct length.
- The function `generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub)` uses permutations of the characters from `s` (excluding `sub`) to generate possible candidates for `n`.
- After filtering valid candidates, it finds the smallest one using the `min` function.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
1. **Leading Zeros**: If the permutation generates a number with leading zeros, it must be handled correctly. For instance, if `s` is "000123" and `sub` is "12", the valid `n` should be "12003", not "01203".
2. **Performance**: With the maximum length of `s` being 1,000,000, generating all permutations is computationally infeasible. This could lead to performance issues or not finding the answer in a reasonable time for large inputs.
3. **Single Digit Case**: If `sub` is "0", the function should return "0" if `s` contains only zeros, but it should not return a leading zero for other candidates.

### Test Case:
- Input: 
  ```
  0000123
  12
  ```
  Expected Output: `12003` 
- The function might generate `01203` as a candidate from permutations which is invalid.

Given these considerations, the program does not handle the leading zero case correctly for some permutations, especially when the valid `n` must not begin with zero. 

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
