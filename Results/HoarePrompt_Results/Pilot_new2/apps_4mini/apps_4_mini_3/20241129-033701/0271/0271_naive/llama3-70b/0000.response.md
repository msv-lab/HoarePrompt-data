To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code against the requirements:

### Problem Description:
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends in `0`. If `n` already ends in `0`, it is already rounded. If `n` ends in `5`, both rounding down to `0` or up to `10` are acceptable.

### Program Logic:
```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 0:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 <= 5:
    print(n - n % 10)
else:
    print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

### Analysis:
1. **If `n % 10 == 0`:** The program correctly outputs `n`, which is the correct behavior.
  
2. **If `n % 10 <= 5`:** The program rounds `n` down to the nearest lower multiple of `10`. This is also correct behavior because:
   - If `n % 10` is between `1` and `5`, rounding down produces a number that ends in `0`, which is desired.

3. **If `n % 10 > 5`:** The program rounds `n` up to the nearest higher multiple of `10`. This is also correct:
   - If `n % 10` is between `6` and `9`, rounding up leads to a number that ends in `0`.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- When `n = 5`: The program will calculate `n % 10` as `5`, falling under the condition `elif n % 10 <= 5`, resulting in `n - n % 10`, which gives `0`. This response is valid as both `0` and `10` are acceptable rounded values.
  
- When `n = 10`: The program will output `10`, which is correct.

- When `n = 15`: The program will output `10`, which is also acceptable.

- When `n = 20`: The program will output `20`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program covers all cases specified in the problem description and meets the requirements correctly. 

As I can't identify any edge cases or inputs where the program would fail to produce the expected results as outlined in the problem, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
