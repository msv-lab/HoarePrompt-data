Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (where \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\)) and prints the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than `n` if the last digit is 5 or less, and the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n` if the last digit is greater than 5. The function does not return any value. **
