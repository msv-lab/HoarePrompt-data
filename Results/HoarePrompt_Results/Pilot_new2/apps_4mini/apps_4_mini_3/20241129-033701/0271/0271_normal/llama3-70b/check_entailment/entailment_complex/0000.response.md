Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads a non-negative integer `n` from the input, which adheres to the constraints \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\).

2. **Rounding Logic**:
   - The first conditional checks if `n` is already a multiple of 10 (`n % 10 == 0`). If true, it simply prints `n`, which is correct as per the description.
   - If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the program checks the last digit of `n` (`n % 10`):
     - If the last digit is less than or equal to 5, the program calculates and prints the largest multiple of 10 less than `n` (`n - n % 10`). This is correct according to the problem specifications.
     - If the last digit is greater than 5, it calculates and prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n` (`n + (10 - n % 10`). Again, this aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Output Requirements**: The program ensures that the output is either the nearest lower or higher multiple of 10, depending on the last digit of `n`. Both options are valid as per the problem description when the last digit is exactly 5 (where rounding can go either way).

Given that every condition and requirement from the problem description is satisfied by the code logic, we conclude that the program is correct. It handles all scenarios described in the problem accurately and efficiently.

Thus, the final assessment of the program's correctness is True.
