The provided program aims to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with a zero. Let's analyze the correctness of the program against the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a single integer `n`, which falls within the constraints (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). This is correct.

2. **Rounding Logic**: 
    - The program calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 using `n % 10`.
    - If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n`, effectively rounding `n` to the nearest lower multiple of 10.
    - If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference of 10 and the remainder to `n`, effectively rounding `n` to the nearest higher multiple of 10.

3. **Correctness of the Rounding Logic**:
    - For a number like 5, the remainder is 5. Since the logic rounds down (because 5 is less than or equal to 5), it correctly rounds to 0.
    - For a number like 113, the remainder is 3. The program rounds down to 110, which is correct.
    - For a number like 1000000000, the remainder is 0, and the number is already a multiple of 10, so it remains unchanged, which is also correct.
    - For a number like 5432359, the remainder is 9. This results in rounding up to 5432360, which adheres to the requirements.

4. **Ambiguity in Rounding**: The problem statement mentions that if `n` ends in 5, it can be correctly rounded to either the lower multiple of 10 or the higher one (e.g., 0 or 10 for `5`). The program's logic to round to the lower number in this case is acceptable according to the problem description since it allows for any correct answer.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases, including edge cases and the ambiguity surrounding rounding 5. Thus, the program correctly implements the rounding behavior as expected.

Correctness: **True**
