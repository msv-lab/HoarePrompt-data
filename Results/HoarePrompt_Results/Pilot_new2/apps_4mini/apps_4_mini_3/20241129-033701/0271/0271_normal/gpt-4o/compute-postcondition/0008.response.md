The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, the output for this function is not provided, thus we cannot determine any specific return values or behavior based on the input parameter. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
