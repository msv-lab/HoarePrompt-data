`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` will hold a value in the range 0 to 9, inclusive. The state of `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`.**
