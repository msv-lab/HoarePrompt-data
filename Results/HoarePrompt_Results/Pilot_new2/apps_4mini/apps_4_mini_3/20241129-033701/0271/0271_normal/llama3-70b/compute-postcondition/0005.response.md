The expression `n - n % 10` calculates the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. Given the initial conditions, `n` is an input integer within the range 0 to 10^9, and it is not a multiple of 10. Additionally, since `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, this means that `n` is between a multiple of 10 and that multiple plus 5. 

As a result, after executing the code, we are left with the value of `n - n % 10`, which is the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`. 

The output state will still reflect the range of `n` and now also specify the result of the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5; result is `n - n % 10` which is the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`.**
