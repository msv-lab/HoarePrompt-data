Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it checks for a traditional palindrome instead of an "s-palindrome". 

An "s-palindrome" is defined as being symmetric about the middle, meaning that the second half must be a mirror reflection of the first half. In particular, this implies that characters must be compared in a specific manner that takes into account their vertical symmetry, not just their positions.

In the provided program, the check only compares characters at symmetric positions from the start and end of the string (i.e., it checks if `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - i - 1]`). However, this disregards the concept of vertical symmetry for each character. For example, while "o" and "O" would be considered symmetric in the traditional sense, an "s-palindrome" would require a more specific check on the visual symmetry of the characters based on their shapes.

Here are some specific issues with the implementation:
1. The program compares characters directly without accounting for their visual symmetry. For example, "b" does not mirror to "d", but the function would allow "bod" to be considered an "s-palindrome".
2. The program only checks for equality of corresponding characters from both ends, which is not sufficient to determine if the string is an "s-palindrome".

Thus, the program fails to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for determining if a string is an "s-palindrome".
