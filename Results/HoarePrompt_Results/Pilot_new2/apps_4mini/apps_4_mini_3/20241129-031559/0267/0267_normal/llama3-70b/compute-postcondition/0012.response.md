According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `k - 1`. The variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to 2. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`. Since `k` is an integer between 2 and 10, and `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2, which is still less than `k`. 

Thus, to execute the loop one more time, the relevant states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is a multiple of 9 equal to `9 * 10^(k - 1)`, `i` is 2**
