    #The program returns the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD, where count(r, k, dp) counts certain values between 1 and r with respect to k, and count(l - 1, k, dp) counts values between 1 and l-1 with respect to k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `l` and `r`, and an integer `k`, and returns the difference between the count of certain values between 1 and `r` (calculated by the `count` function) and the count of certain values between 1 and `l-1`, all modulo `MOD`. It effectively counts specific values related to `k` in the ranges [1, r] and [1, l-1].

If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90` and then `dp[n, k]` is taken modulo `MOD`.
    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value of dp[n, k] which is determined by the conditions on n and k, where if n is less than 10^k, then dp[n, k] is equal to n, and if n is greater than or equal to 10^k, dp[n, k] is updated to dp[n, k] + 90 and taken modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k` (between 1 and 10 inclusive), and a dictionary `dp` for memoization. It returns 0 if `k` is 0. If `k` is not 0, it checks if the value for `(n, k)` is already cached in `dp` and returns it if found. If `n` is less than `10^k`, it sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^k`, it calculates and updates `dp[n, k]` based on a formula that considers the contributions from previous computations, taking into account the modulo operation with `MOD`. The function ultimately returns the updated value of `dp[n, k]`. An edge case to note is that if `k` is 0, the function will not perform any additional calculations and will simply return 0.
