Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `l` and `r`, where 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, and an integer `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. It calculates and returns the sum of all integers in the range from `l` to `r` that satisfy a condition defined by another function `func_1(num, k)`. If no integers in that range satisfy the condition, the function returns 0. The resulting sum is computed modulo a constant `MOD`. **
