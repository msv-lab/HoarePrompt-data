The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous value of `num` is `l + 2`, and `total_sum` is updated accordingly. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to `((total_sum + (l + 2)) % MOD)`, `num` is `l + 2`, `l` is at least 1, `r` is at least `l + 2`, and `r` is less than \(10^{18}\) if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true.**
