To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze if the program correctly computes the sum of numbers between two integers \( l \) and \( r \) that have at most \( k \) different digits.

### Breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters, \( l \), \( r \), and \( k \).
2. **Counting Function**: The nested function `count(n, k, dp)` is designed to calculate the contribution of numbers with at most \( k \) different digits up to \( n \).
3. **Dynamic Programming Memoization**: It uses a dictionary `dp` to store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.
4. **Base Cases**: It checks for base cases where \( k = 0 \) or \( n < 10^k \) to determine how many valid numbers exist.
5. **Computation Logic**: 
   - It calculates contributions based on the number of different digits allowed.
   - It uses combinatorial logic to determine how many numbers can be formed without exceeding \( k \) different digits.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Cases**: The current handling of digits may lead to incorrect values for cases where \( k < 10 \).
2. **Incorrect Count Logic**: The logic in the counting function doesn't directly address how to sum the numbers that meet the digit conditions; it only counts them without the summation logic.
3. **General Cases**: For larger ranges or specific distributions of numbers, the logic may fail to account for all valid numbers correctly.

### Verification:
Let's consider a specific edge case:
- **Example Input**: \( l = 10, r = 50, k = 1 \)
- The valid numbers are \( 11, 22, 33, 44 \).
- The expected output is \( 110 \).
- The program needs to ensure it counts only numbers formed by a single digit (1, 2, 3, 4).

However, since the function `count` primarily focuses on counting possibilities rather than summing actual valid numbers, it might not accumulate the sum correctly. 

### Conclusion:
Given that the program only accounts for the count of numbers fitting the criteria and lacks a direct mechanism to compute their sum, it will yield incorrect results for many valid inputs, especially for cases where \( k \) is less than 10.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly sum numbers that meet the digit conditions as described in the prompt for all potential cases.
