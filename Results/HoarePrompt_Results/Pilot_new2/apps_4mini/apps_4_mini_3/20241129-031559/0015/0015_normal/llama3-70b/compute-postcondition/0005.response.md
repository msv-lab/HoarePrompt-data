The code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, there are no changes in values of `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range -10^9 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is an input integer within the range -10^9 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, `c` is 0, and `a` is not equal to `b`.**
