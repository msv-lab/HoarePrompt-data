Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` through user input and performs the following checks: If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, it outputs 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, it outputs 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; if both conditions are met, it outputs 'YES', otherwise it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value.**
