Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`.

Here's how the program meets the requirements set out in the problem description:

1. **Direct Equality Check**: The program first checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If they are equal, it prints "YES", which is correct since `b` is indeed part of the sequence (the first element).

2. **Handling Zero Difference**: If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` equals zero, the program prints "NO". This is correct because if `c` is zero, the sequence does not change from `a`, and hence can only produce the single value `a`. If `b` is different from `a`, then `b` cannot be part of the sequence.

3. **General Case with Non-zero Difference**: In the case where `c` is not zero, the program checks if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` (`(b - a) % c == 0`) and if `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. This is correct because:
   - The divisibility check ensures that we can reach `b` from `a` using steps of size `c`.
   - The non-negativity check ensures that we are moving forward in the sequence (i.e., that `i` is a positive integer).

Through these checks, the program effectively captures all scenarios outlined in the problem description:
- It correctly handles cases where `a` equals `b`.
- It appropriately differentiates when `c` is zero and handles the non-zero difference with the necessary conditions.

Therefore, the program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all possible inputs within the specified limits.
