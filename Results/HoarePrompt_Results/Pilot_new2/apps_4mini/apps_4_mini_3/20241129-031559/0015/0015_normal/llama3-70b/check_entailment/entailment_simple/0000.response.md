To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program in detail and see if it meets the requirements of checking if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`.

### Problem Analysis:

The sequence is defined as:
- The first term is `s_1 = a`
- The subsequent terms are generated by adding `c` to the previous term, i.e., `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c`

The goal is to determine if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`, which translates to the equation:
- `b = a + (i - 1) * c` 
Rearranging this gives us:
- `(b - a) = (i - 1) * c`
Thus, we need to check if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` (i.e., `(b - a) % c == 0`) and if the resulting `i` (which can be calculated as `(b - a) / c + 1`) is positive.

### Program Analysis:

1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - If `c` is 0, the sequence is constant, and all terms are `a`.
   - The program correctly checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to determine if `b` can be reached from `a` in steps of `c`.
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, ensuring that we are moving forward in the sequence (i.e., `i` must be positive).

The conditions laid out in the program cover all necessary cases:
- It correctly handles the scenario when `c` is zero, which is a special case.
- For non-zero `c`, the checks ensure that we only accept `b` if it can be reached from `a` while maintaining the properties of the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem requirements and correctly determines if `b` appears in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`. 

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
