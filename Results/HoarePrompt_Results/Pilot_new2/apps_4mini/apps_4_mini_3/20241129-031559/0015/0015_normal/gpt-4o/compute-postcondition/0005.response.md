The code executes a print statement, which outputs 'NO' to the console. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that these variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input, `b` is not equal to `a`, and the current value of `c` is 0; 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
