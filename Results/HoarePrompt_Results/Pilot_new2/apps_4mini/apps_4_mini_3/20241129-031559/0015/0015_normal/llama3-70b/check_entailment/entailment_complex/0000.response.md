Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first term `a` and the common difference `c`. 

Here's the explanation of the correctness:

1. **Handling when `c` is zero**:
   - If `c` is zero, the sequence does not change and remains constant at `a` (i.e., the sequence is `a, a, a, ...`).
   - The program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it prints "YES", indicating that `b` is indeed in the sequence (the sequence always equals `a`). If not, it prints "NO", correctly indicating that `b` is not in the sequence.

2. **Handling when `c` is not zero**:
   - When `c` is non-zero, the sequence becomes an arithmetic progression defined by `a + k*c` for non-negative integers `k`.
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which determines if `b` can be expressed as an element in the sequence. This modulus check ensures that there exists some integer `k` such that `b = a + k*c`.
   - Additionally, it checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which ensures that the index `k` is a non-negative integer (since we cannot have negative indices in a sequence).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

This logic accurately reflects the requirements of the problem description for all possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the specified bounds. Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements and is correct.
