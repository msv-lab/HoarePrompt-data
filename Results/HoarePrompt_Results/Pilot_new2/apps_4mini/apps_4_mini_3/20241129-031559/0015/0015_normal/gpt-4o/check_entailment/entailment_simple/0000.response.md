Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. Here's why the program meets the problem requirements:

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If `b` is equal to `a`, it immediately returns "YES", which is correct because the first element of the sequence is `a`.

2. **Handling Zero Difference**: If `b` is not equal to `a`, the program checks if `c` (the difference between consecutive elements) is zero. If `c` is zero and `b` is not equal to `a`, it correctly outputs "NO", since all elements in the sequence will be `a`, and thus `b` cannot be present.

3. **Checking for Presence in the Sequence**: When `c` is not zero, the program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which ensures that `b` can be expressed as a term in the arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a step of `c`. Additionally, `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that the index `i` (the number of steps taken from `a` to reach `b`) is a positive integer. Both conditions must be satisfied for `b` to be in the sequence.

4. **Output**: Based on the evaluations above, the program prints "YES" if both conditions are met, and "NO" otherwise.

Overall, the program handles all edge cases correctly, including situations where:
- `b` equals `a`
- `c` equals zero
- `b` is unreachable due to the sequence's properties.

Thus, the program accurately implements the requirements laid out in the problem description, ensuring that it checks all necessary conditions for `b` to appear in the sequence `s`.
