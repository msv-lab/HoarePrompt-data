Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, the output is 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `c` remains 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `c` is not equal to 0, then if the difference (b - a) is divisible by c and (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if (b - a) is not divisible by c or (b - a) / c is negative, 'NO' is printed.***
