The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. This does not change any variable values, but it confirms that the condition stated in the initial state holds true. The initial conditions regarding the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain valid.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, and `c` is not equal to 0. The difference (b - a) is divisible by c, and the result of (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0; 'YES' has been printed.**
