Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the number `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. 

1. When `c == 0`, the sequence consists of the constant value `a`, so the program checks if `a` equals `b`. If they are equal, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".
   
2. When `c` is not zero, the program checks whether the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and ensures that the result of that division is non-negative. This means that `b` can be reached starting from `a` and moving in increments of `c`.

The program handles all relevant edge cases outlined in the problem description, including:
- Cases where `c` is zero.
- Cases where `b` is equal to `a`.
- Cases where the calculation determines that `b` cannot be obtained from `a` using the increment `c`.

Therefore, no potential case is found where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.
