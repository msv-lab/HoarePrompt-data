To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the program logic.

The problem states that we need to check if the number `b` appears in a sequence defined by:
- The first element `s_1 = a`
- The difference between any two neighboring elements is `c`.

This means the sequence can be expressed as:
- `s_i = a + (i-1)*c` for `i = 1, 2, 3, ...`

The conditions that need to be considered for `b` to be in the sequence are:
1. If `b` is equal to `a`, then `b` is in the sequence.
2. If `c` is 0, the sequence will contain only the element `a`, so if `b` is not equal to `a`, it will not be in the sequence.
3. If `c` is not 0, we need to check if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` (i.e., `(b - a) % c == 0`) and also ensure that the index `i` represented by `(b - a) / c` is positive (i.e., `i >= 1` which translates to `(b - a) / c >= 0`).

Now let's analyze the given program:

```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **Case 1: `b == a`** - The program correctly identifies that `b` is in the sequence, printing "YES".
2. **Case 2: `c == 0`** - If `c` is zero, the program prints "NO" unless `b` equals `a`, which is also correct since the sequence does not change.
3. **Case 3: When `c` is not zero** - It checks both conditions:
   - `(b - a) % c == 0` ensures that `b` is a term in the sequence based on the arithmetic progression.
   - `(b - a) / c >= 0` checks if the term is reached after a non-negative multiplication of `c`.

However, it is important to note a potential issue in the program logic:

When `c` is positive, and if `b` is less than `a`, the program should directly return "NO" since the sequence can only increase from `a`. This is implicitly handled by the condition `(b - a) / c >= 0`, but it does not explicitly check if `b < a` when `c > 0`, which could lead to confusion.

Similarly, when `c` is negative, and if `b` is greater than `a`, the sequence can only decrease, which is also implicitly covered but not explicitly checked.

Thus, the program may not handle all edge cases as clearly as it should, particularly when `b` is not aligned with the direction of the sequence based on `c`.

To illustrate:

Consider the case:
- Input: `3 2 -1`
- Expected Output: "NO" (since the sequence would be `3, 2, 1, ...` and `2` is indeed present, but if we have a positive `c` it should still return a "NO" if `b > a`).

This leads us to conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not explicitly account for cases where `b` lies outside the generated sequence based on the sign of `c`, which can lead to incorrect outputs.
