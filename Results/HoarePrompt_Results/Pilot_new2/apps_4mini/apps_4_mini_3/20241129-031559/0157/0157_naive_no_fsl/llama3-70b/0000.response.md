Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that Nikolay can use to cook the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4.

Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c).
2. It calculates how many complete sets of fruits can be used in the compote based on the ratio:
   - For each lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears are required.
   - Thus, it computes the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon`) as:
     - The number of lemons available (`a`).
     - The number of complete pairs of apples (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon, calculated as `b // 2`).
     - The number of complete sets of pears (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon, calculated as `c // 4`).
3. The final output is calculated as the sum of the lemons, apples, and pears used, which is given by:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, simplifying to `min_lemon * 7`.

The program correctly handles cases where any of the fruits are insufficient to make even one set of the compote, which results in a total output of 0.

Overall, the implementation adheres to the problem requirements and correctly computes the expected output for all valid inputs specified in the problem description.
