The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is 4, `used_cubes[4]` is True, `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
