Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, and `i` is 4. If `used_cubes[4]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[4]`, then `used_cubes[4]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
