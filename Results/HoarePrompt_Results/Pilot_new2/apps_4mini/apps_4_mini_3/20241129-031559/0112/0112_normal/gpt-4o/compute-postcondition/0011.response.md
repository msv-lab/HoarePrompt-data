The variable `used_cubes[i]` is being assigned the value `True`. The value of `i` is currently 1, so `used_cubes[1]` will be set to `True`. The values of the other variables, `n`, `digits`, `digit`, and `found`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[1]` is True.**
