The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` cubes, each represented as a list of 6 integers (digits 0-9). It returns the maximum integer `x` such that all digits from 1 to `x` can be formed using the digits on the faces of the cubes. If there are any digits missing from the cubes that are required to form the sequential integers up to `x`, the function will stop increasing `x` and return the highest valid integer that can be formed.
