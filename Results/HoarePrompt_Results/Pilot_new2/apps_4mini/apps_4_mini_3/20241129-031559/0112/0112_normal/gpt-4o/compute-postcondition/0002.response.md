According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, the `digits` list must have at least one character (digit) to iterate over. Given the state before the loop, `n` is between 1 and 3, which does not directly affect the execution of the loop but indicates that there might be some restrictions based on that in the loop body. The `used_cubes` list is initialized with `n` elements set to `False`, but this also does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

So, for the loop to be executed, the `digits` list must have at least one character, and `digit` will represent the first character in the list at the beginning of the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list**
