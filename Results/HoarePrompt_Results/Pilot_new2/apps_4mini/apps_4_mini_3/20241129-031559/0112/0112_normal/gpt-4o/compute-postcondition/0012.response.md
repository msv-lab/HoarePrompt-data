The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, but it is already `True` in the initial state, so there is no change to its value. The other variables remain unaffected as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[1]` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[1]` is True.**
