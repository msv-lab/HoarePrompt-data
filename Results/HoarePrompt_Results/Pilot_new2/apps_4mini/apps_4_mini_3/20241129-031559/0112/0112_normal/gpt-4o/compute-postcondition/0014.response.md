Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, and `i` is 1. If `used_cubes[1]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
