The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[2]` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
