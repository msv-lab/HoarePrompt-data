Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, and `i` is 2. If `used_cubes[2]` is not True and `digit` is in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
