The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `used_cubes` reflects which cubes were used with `used_cubes[i]` is True, `i` is 0, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
