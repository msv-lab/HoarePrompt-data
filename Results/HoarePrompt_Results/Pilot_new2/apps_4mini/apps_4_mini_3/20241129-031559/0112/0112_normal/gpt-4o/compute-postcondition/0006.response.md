The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, which means that the `i`-th element of the `used_cubes` list is now marked as used. Since `i` is currently 0, this specifically affects `used_cubes[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[0]` is True.**
