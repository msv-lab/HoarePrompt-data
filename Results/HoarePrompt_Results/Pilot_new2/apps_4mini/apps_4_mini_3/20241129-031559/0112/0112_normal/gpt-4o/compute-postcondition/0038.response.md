The code `used_cubes[i] = True` assigns the value `True` to the index `i` of the list `used_cubes`. The variable `i` is currently 2, which means that the third element of the list `used_cubes` will be set to `True`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[2]` is True**.
