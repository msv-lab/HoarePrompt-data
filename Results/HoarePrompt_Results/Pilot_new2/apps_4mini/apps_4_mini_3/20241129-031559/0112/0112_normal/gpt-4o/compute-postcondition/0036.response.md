Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, and `i` is 1. If `used_cubes[1]` is not used and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
