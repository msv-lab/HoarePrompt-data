The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and each of the next n lines contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes with values between 0 and 9. The function has multiple return points based on certain conditions: 

- Case_1: The function returns `False`, indicating that a specified digit was not found in any of the cube faces.
- Case_2: The function returns `False`, indicating that no matching condition was met during the execution of the loop.
- Case_3: The function returns `False`, indicating that no cube was used for the digit, and the state of used cubes remains unchanged.
- Case_4: The function returns `True`, indicating that all digits have been successfully matched to the available cubes.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and determine if all specified digits can be formed using the available cubes, returning `True` if successful and `False` in various scenarios of failure. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `num`, and returns `True` if all digits can be matched to the available cubes; otherwise, it returns `False` in multiple cases indicating different reasons for failure.**
