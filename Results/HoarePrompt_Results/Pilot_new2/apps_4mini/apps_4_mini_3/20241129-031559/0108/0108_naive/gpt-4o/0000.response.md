Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where characters in the input string `s` can be replaced to transform into the target subsequence. For instance, consider the input string `zab`. The program would fail because it does not account for replacing characters prior to reaching `z`, and thus it is impossible to form the subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" from `zab`. The expected output should be `-1`, but it incorrectly tries to find the subsequence without recognizing that characters must be replaced to move from one letter to the next in the alphabet. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for this specific case.
