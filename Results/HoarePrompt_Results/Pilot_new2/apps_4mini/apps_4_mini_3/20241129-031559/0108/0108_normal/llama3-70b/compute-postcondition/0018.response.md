According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again, `char` must be an element in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is `final_char + 2`. Given that `final_char` is less than 'y', the next character (i.e., `final_char + 1`) and the character after that (i.e., `final_char + 2`) must also be present in `s` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `s` contains the result of replacing the first instance of `char` with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`, and `char` is currently `final_char + 2`, we need to adjust the state so that `s` contains `char`, which is `final_char + 2`. 

This means that `s` must be modified to ensure it includes the character represented by `final_char + 2`. Therefore, we need to clarify that `s` must include the character `char`, which is `final_char + 2`.

State: **`s` must contain `char`, `char` is `final_char + 2`, `res` still contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to `final_char`, `original_s` must have contained characters from 'a' to `final_char`, and `final_char` must be less than 'y'.**
