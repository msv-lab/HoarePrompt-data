You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a string s consisting of |s| small english letters.

In one move you can replace any character of this string to the next character in alphabetical order (a will be replaced with b, s will be replaced with t, etc.). You cannot replace letter z with any other letter.

Your target is to make some number of moves (not necessary minimal) to get string abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz (english alphabet) as a subsequence. Subsequence of the string is the string that is obtained by deleting characters at some positions. You need to print the string that will be obtained from the given string and will be contain english alphabet as a subsequence or say that it is impossible.


-----Input-----

The only one line of the input consisting of the string s consisting of |s| (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5) small english letters.


-----Output-----

If you can get a string that can be obtained from the given string and will contain english alphabet as a subsequence, print it. Otherwise print «-1» (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input

Output
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Input

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 100,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    target = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    target_len = len(target)
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(s) and j < target_len:
        if s[i] == target[j]:
            j += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to the number of characters from `target` that were found in `s` in order, which is between 0 and 26. If `j` is less than 26, then not all characters of `target` were found in `s`. If `j` is 26, then all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order.
    if (j == target_len) :
        print(target)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is equal to the length of `s`. If `j` is equal to `target_len`, then all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order, and `target` is printed. Otherwise, `j` is between 0 and 25, indicating that not all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and checks if all the letters of the English alphabet (from 'a' to 'z') are present in `s` in order. If all characters are found in the correct order, it prints the alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. This means if `s` is missing any characters from the alphabet or if they are not in the correct order, the function will return -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
