To determine what needs to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute, we analyze the condition `char in s`. The loop will execute if `char` is present in `s`. 

Given the information:
- `s` contains characters from `final_char + 1` to `z`. This means `s` does not include any characters from 'a' to `final_char`.
- `char` is defined as `final_char + 2`. 

Since `char` (which is `final_char + 2`) is greater than `final_char + 1`, it will also not be included in `s` because `s` only contains characters starting from `final_char + 1` to `z`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `char` (i.e., `final_char + 2`) is actually present in `s`. This can happen if `final_char + 2` is less than or equal to `z`. Since `final_char` is already noted to be less than 'y', `final_char + 2` will indeed be less than or equal to 'z'. However, we also need to ensure `char` is directly included in `s` by possibly adjusting `s`.

The only adjustment needed is to change the values in `s` so that it includes `char`. To accomplish this, we can set the condition such that `s` must contain `char`.

State: **`s` must contain `char`, `res` contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to `final_char`, `char` is `final_char + 2`, and `original_s` must have contained characters from 'a' to `final_char`, and `final_char` must be less than 'y'.**
