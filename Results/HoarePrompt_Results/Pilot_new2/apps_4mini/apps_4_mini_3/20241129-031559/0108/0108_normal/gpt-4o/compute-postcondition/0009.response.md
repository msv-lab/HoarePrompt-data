To determine if the loop will execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop: `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len`.

1. **Current State**:
   - We know that `i` is currently 1.
   - `len(s)` is the length of the string `s`, which is between 1 and 100,000. Therefore, `len(s)` is at least 1.
   - `j` is incremented to 1 only if `s[i]` is equal to 'a'. We do not know the current value of `j`, but we know `target_len` is 26.

2. **Assessing `i < len(s)`**:
   - Since `i` is 1, for the loop to execute again, `len(s)` must be greater than 1 (i.e., it should be at least 2).

3. **Assessing `j < target_len`**:
   - Since `j` is incremented to 1 if `s[i]` is 'a', we conclude that `j` must be less than 26 to allow another iteration (i.e., `j` must be 0 or 1 currently).

Given this analysis, we determine:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure `len(s)` is at least 2 (because `i` is currently 1) and that `j` is less than 26.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `len(s)` must be greater than 1.
- `j` must be less than 26.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length greater than 1; `j` must be less than 26**.
