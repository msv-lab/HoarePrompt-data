According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, and `j`. The loop can continue executing as long as both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, meaning its current value is now one more than it was at the start of this iteration. Given that `s` is a string of length greater than 1, `len(s)` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(s)` (which means `i` must be less than 2 if it was previously 1, for example). 

Additionally, `j` is less than 26, so there are no changes needed there if we want the loop to continue executing because the condition `j < target_len` must also hold true for the loop to execute again.

To ensure the loop can run one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(s)`, which requires modifying `i` to be less than the length of the string `s`. The state of `j` needs no adjustments as it is already valid as long as `j` is less than `target_len`.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` appropriately to ensure it is strictly less than `len(s)`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length greater than 1; `j` is less than 26; `i` must be less than len(s)**
