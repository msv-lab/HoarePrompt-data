The value of `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. Since `char` is `final_char + 2`, and `final_char` is less than 'y', `char` would be a character that follows `final_char` and thus is valid. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` must contain `char`, `res` now contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to `final_char`, plus `char`, `char` is `final_char + 2`, and `original_s` must have contained characters from 'a' to `final_char`, and `final_char` must be less than 'y'.**
