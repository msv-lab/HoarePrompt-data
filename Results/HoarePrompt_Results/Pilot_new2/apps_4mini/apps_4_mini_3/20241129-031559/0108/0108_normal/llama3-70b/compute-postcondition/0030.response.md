The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `char`, which is defined as `final_char + 1`. The precondition states that `s` must include the character `char`, where `char` is `final_char + 1`, and `final_char` is less than 'y'. This means `char` will be a character that follows `final_char`. 

Since `final_char` is less than 'y', `char` can take values from 'a' to 'y' (specifically, 'b' to 'z' depending on the value of `final_char`). The states of the other variables (`s` and `final_char`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` must include the character `char`, where `char` is `final_char + 1`, and `final_char` is less than 'y'; `res` is incremented by `char`.

Output State: **`s` must include the character `char`, where `char` is `final_char + 1`, and `final_char` is less than 'y'; `res` is incremented by `char`.**
