The code assigns the value of the length of the string `target` to the variable `target_len`. Since `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', its length is 26. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26**.
