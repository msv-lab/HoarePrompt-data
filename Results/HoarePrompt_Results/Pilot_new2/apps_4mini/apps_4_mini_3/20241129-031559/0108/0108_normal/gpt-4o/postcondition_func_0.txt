The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and checks if all the letters of the English alphabet (from 'a' to 'z') are present in `s` in order. If all characters are found in the correct order, it prints the alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. This means if `s` is missing any characters from the alphabet or if they are not in the correct order, the function will return -1.
