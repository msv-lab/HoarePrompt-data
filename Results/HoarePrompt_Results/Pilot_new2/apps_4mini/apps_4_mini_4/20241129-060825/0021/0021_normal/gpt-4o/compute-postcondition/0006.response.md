The variable `dist3` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - min_pos)`. Given that `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in list `a`, the value of `dist3` will be equal to `min_pos` since it is the absolute difference from `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`.**
