The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. Instead, it operates with the given constraints: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to n. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without further details regarding what the function returns or the purpose of the inputs, we cannot accurately describe the return value. 

Assuming there is a missing description for the output, the functionality can only be partially defined based on the parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates with `n` as an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `a` as a list of `n` distinct integers (each in the range 1 to n). The return value is not specified.**
