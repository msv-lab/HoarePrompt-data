The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n). It calculates the maximum distance from either end of the list (index 0 or index n-1) to the positions of the integers 1 and n in the list `a`. The function then prints this maximum distance. However, it does not handle cases where the input does not meet the specified constraints, such as invalid integers or improper list lengths.
