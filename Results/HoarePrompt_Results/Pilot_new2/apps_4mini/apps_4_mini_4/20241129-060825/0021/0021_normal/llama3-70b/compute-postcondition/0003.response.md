The variable `posn` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the value `n` in the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers within the range 1 to `n`. Therefore, `posn` will be the index where the value `n` first appears in the list `a`. Since `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `n` will definitely be in the list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100\); `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers within the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
