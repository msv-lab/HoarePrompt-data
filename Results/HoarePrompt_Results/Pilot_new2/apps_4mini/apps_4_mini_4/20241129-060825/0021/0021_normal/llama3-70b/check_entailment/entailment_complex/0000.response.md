To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the program logic.

### Problem Description:
1. The input consists of an integer `n` (the size of the permutation) and a list of `n` distinct integers (permutation of integers from 1 to `n`).
2. The goal is to perform exactly one swap to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n).
3. The output should be the maximum possible distance after one swap.

### Analyzed Program Logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2. **Finding Positions**:
   - `pos1 = a.index(1)` retrieves the position of the minimum element (1).
   - `posn = a.index(n)` retrieves the position of the maximum element (n).
3. **Calculating Distances**:
   - The program calculates `max_dist` as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`. This calculation aims to find the maximum distance after considering a swap.
   - `min_dist` is calculated as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, but this doesn't seem necessary for the logic of maximizing the distance.
   - The final output is determined by `print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))`.

### Issues Identified:
1. The calculation `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` does not correctly represent the logic of maximizing distance after a specific swap. Instead, it tries to find the maximum distance that could be achieved by reducing the current distance by one (not considering the swap effectively).
2. The use of `min_dist` is unclear in the context of the approach to maximize distance. This doesn't align with the problem's requirement to find the maximum possible distance after one swap.
3. If `pos1` and `posn` are already at opposite ends of the list (like the case for the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n]), the program doesn't logically ensure that a proper valid swap is considered that could maintain or increase the distance, leading to miscalculations in some cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The way distances are calculated and the unnecessary computations make it possible for the program to fail in some cases.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
Correctness: **False**
