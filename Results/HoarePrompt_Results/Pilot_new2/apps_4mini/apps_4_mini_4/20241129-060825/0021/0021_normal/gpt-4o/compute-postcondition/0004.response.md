The value of `dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between `0` and `max_pos`. The value of `max_pos` is determined by the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, `dist1` will be equal to `max_pos`, since the absolute value of `0 - max_pos` is simply `max_pos`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.**
