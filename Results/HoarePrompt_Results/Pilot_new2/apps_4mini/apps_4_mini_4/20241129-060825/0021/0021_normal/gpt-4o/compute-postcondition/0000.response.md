`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` must still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The list `a` remains unchanged since the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n`, and `n` is now the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n`, and `n` is now the input integer.**
