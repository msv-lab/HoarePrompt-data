To determine the output state, let's analyze the initial conditions and the effect of the code.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying \( 1 \leq a[i] \leq n \)
- `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`
- `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`
- `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`
- `dist2` is equal to \( \text{abs}(n - 1 - \text{max_pos}) \)
- `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`
- `dist4` is equal to \( \text{abs}(n - 1 - \text{min_pos}) \)

The code calculates `max_distance` as the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. 

Since `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are dependent on the values of `min_pos` and `max_pos`, the maximum value among these four distances will be determined, but it does not change any of the initial parameters directly. 

Thus, the output will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`; `dist4` is equal to abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is equal to max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)**.
