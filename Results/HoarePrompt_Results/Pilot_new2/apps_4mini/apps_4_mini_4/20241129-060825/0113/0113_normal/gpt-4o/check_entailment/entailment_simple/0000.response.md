To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the implementation of the function `func_1` in relation to the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to compute the "k-rounding" of a positive integer `n`, which is defined as the smallest positive integer `x` that:
1. Is divisible by `n`.
2. Ends with `k` or more zeros in base 10.

### Function Analysis
1. **Multiplier Calculation**: The line `multiplier = 10 ** k` correctly computes the required multiplier that gives us `k` trailing zeros, as a number must be a multiple of `10^k` to end with at least `k` zeros.
  
2. **Calculation of x**: The expression `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` attempts to find the smallest integer that is divisible by `n` and also a multiple of `10^k`.
   - Here, `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` finds the greatest common divisor between `n` and `10^k`. 
   - Dividing `10^k` by `gcd(n, multiplier)` gives the least multiple of `10^k` that is divisible by `n`.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `x`, which is the computed value that should meet the conditions outlined.

### Reasoning About Correctness
- **When k = 0**: The program should return `n` itself, as any integer is divisible by itself, and it has no trailing zeros (because `10^0 = 1`). The implementation handles this correctly.
  
- **When k > 0**: The implementation effectively finds the least integer that is a multiple of both `n` and `10^k`. Since `x` is formulated by scaling `n` appropriately using the GCD, it guarantees that `x` is divisible by `n` and has at least `k` trailing zeros.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It accurately computes the k-rounding of `n` by ensuring the result is divisible by `n` and ends with the appropriate number of zeros.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
