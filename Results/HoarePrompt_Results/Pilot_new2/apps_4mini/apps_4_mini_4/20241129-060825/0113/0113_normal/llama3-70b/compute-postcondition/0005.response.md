The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `n` is `n + 1`, this means `n` is currently equal to its previous value plus 1. After the increment, `n` will be `n + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is now `n + 2`, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, and `x` is equal to 10.

Output State: **`n` is now `n + 2`, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, `x` is equal to 10**.
