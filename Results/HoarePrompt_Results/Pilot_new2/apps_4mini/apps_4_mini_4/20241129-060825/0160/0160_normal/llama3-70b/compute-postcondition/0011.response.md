According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `gcd`. The loop iterates from 1 to the integer value of the square root of `gcd`. For the loop to execute, `gcd` must be at least 1, which is guaranteed since it is the greatest common divisor of the elements of list `A` and `N` is a positive integer, ensuring that `A` is not empty.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 1, as it is the starting point of the range specified in the loop.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` must be at least 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1**
