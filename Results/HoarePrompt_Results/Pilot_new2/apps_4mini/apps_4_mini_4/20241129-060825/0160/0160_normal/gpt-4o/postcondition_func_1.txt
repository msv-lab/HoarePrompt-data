The function accepts a tuple `x` containing an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of `N` integers `A`. It calculates and returns the sorted list of all divisors of `N` in descending order. Note that the integers `K` and the list `A` are not used in the computation, so their presence does not affect the output.
