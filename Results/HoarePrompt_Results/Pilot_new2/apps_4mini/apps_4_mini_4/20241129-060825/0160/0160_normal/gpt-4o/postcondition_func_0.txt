The function accepts a list of integers `lst`, where the list contains at least 2 integers followed by up to 498 additional integers (making a total of between 2 and 500 integers). It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list. The function does not validate input length or integer ranges beyond the assumption stated, and it requires the input to contain at least 2 integers for proper execution.
