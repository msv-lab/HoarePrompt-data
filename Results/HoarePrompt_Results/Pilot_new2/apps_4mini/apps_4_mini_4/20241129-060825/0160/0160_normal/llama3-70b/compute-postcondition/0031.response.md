Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` (between 2 and 500), a non-negative integer `K` (not exceeding 10^9), and a list `A` of `N` integers (each between 1 and 10^6). It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in the list `A`, then finds and prints the largest divisor of this GCD. If the GCD is 1, the function will print 1, as 1 is the only divisor of 1. The function does not utilize the parameter `K` in any computation. **
