`gcd` is updated by computing the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[i]`. The value of `gcd` is now equal to `math.gcd(previous gcd, A[2])`, where the previous value of `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`. The other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2])`.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2])**
