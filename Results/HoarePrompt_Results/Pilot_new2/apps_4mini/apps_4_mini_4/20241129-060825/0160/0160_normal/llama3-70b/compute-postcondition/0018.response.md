According to the code, the loop will execute while `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

We also need to determine the maximum value `i` can take for the loop to execute again. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Therefore, for the loop to run another time, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is at least 1, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd`, `i` is 2, and `gcd` must be at least 4.**
