Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where `x[0]` is N (2 <= N <= 500), `x[1]` is K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and `x[2]` is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6); `divisors` is an empty set; `i` is 1; `sqrt(N)` is valid (N >= 2); and the current value of `i` divides `N` without a remainder (i.e., N % i == 0).***
