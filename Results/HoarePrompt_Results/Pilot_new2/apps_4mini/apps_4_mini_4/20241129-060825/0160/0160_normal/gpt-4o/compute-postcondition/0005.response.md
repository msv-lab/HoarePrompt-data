Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where `x[0]` is N (2 <= N <= 500), `x[1]` is K (0 <= K <= 10^9), `x[2]` is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6); if `i` divides `N`, then `divisors` contains the values {1, N} and `i` is 1; otherwise, the state of `divisors` remains unchanged.***
