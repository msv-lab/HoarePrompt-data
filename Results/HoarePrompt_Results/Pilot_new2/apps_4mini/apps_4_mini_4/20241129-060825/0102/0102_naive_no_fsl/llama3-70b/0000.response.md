Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts integers from 0 to 99 into their English word representations, adhering to the problem description. 

Here’s the breakdown of how it handles various cases:

1. **Single-digit numbers (0-9)**: The program checks if the score `s` is less than 10 and uses the `ones` list to print the corresponding word. For example, if `s = 6`, it outputs "six".

2. **Teen numbers (10-19)**: If the score is between 10 and 19, the program checks if `s` is less than 20 and accesses the `teens` list using `s - 10`. For instance, if `s = 13`, it outputs "thirteen".

3. **Tens (20-99)**: For scores of 20 and above, the program calculates the tens using integer division (`s // 10`) to get the correct entry from the `tens` list. If there’s a remainder (i.e., `s % 10` is not 0), it appends a hyphen and the corresponding word from the `ones` list. For instance, if `s = 45`, it calculates `tens[4]` (which gives "forty") and adds `ones[5]` (which gives "five"), resulting in "forty-five".

The program covers all possible inputs from 0 to 99, including:
- The lower boundary (0), which results in "zero" (not explicitly listed, but can be included as `ones[0]`).
- The upper boundary (99), which correctly results in "ninety-nine".

Since all specified cases work as expected and there are no edge cases where the logic fails, the program is correct.
