Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. Here's how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer input `s` which falls within the specified range of 0 to 99 (inclusive). This matches the problem constraint.

2. **Output Representation**:
   - For scores less than 10 (i.e., 0 to 9), the program utilizes the `ones` list to retrieve the correct English word. For example, when `s` is 6, it outputs "six".
   - For scores between 10 and 19, the program uses the `teens` list to correctly map these numbers to their respective word forms. For instance, when `s` is 16, it outputs "sixteen".
   - For scores 20 and above (up to 99), the program uses the `tens` list to get the tens part and combines it with the `ones` list for the units part, if necessary. For instance, when `s` is 35, it outputs "thirty-five".

3. **Hyphenation**: The program correctly adds a hyphen (`-`) between the tens and ones when applicable (e.g., "twenty-one" for 21) and ensures that no spaces are included in the output.

All scenarios covered in the problem description are handled accurately by the program, and it produces the expected output for all possible integer values of `s` within the specified range. Thus, the program is deemed correct based on the requirements given.
