The function accepts two integers, `n` (between 1 and 100) and `t` (a positive integer between 1 and 100,000), and processes `n` bus routes, each characterized by two integers `s` (the start time) and `d` (the duration). It calculates the minimum time until the next bus departs based on the current time `t`, and returns the 1-based index of the bus route that has the minimum wait time. If no buses are available, it will still return the index of the first bus (1), as it assumes there is always at least one bus.
