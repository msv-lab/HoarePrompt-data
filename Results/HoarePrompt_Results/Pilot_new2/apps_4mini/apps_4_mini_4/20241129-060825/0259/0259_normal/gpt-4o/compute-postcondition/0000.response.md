The value of `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This indicates that initially, the minimum wait time is set to the highest possible value, as no bus arrival times have been calculated yet. The values of `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes` remain unaffected by this particular line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station (1 <= t <= 10^5), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i and d_i) representing the first bus arrival time and the interval of subsequent buses for each route (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5); `min_wait_time` is float('inf').**
