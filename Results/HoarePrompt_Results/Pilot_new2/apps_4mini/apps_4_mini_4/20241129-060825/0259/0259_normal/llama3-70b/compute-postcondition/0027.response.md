`min_time` is assigned the value of `time`. The variable `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, where `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses` and `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`. The values of `n`, `buses`, `i`, `s`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 3 tuples of the form (s, d), `i` is 2, `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`, `time` is assigned the value `(t - s) % d`, `min_time` is equal to `time`.**
