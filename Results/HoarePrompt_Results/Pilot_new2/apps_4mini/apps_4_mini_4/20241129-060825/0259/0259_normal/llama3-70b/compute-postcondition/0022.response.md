The variable `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`. The value of `time` is given by the expression `(t - s) % d`, where `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, and `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of the form (s, d), `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, and `min_time = (t - s) % d`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of the form (s, d), `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `min_time = (t - s) % d**
