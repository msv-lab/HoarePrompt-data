To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Recap
1. Serval arrives at a bus station at time `t`.
2. There are `n` bus routes, each defined by:
   - `s_i`: the first bus arrival time for the i-th route.
   - `d_i`: the interval in minutes between subsequent buses for that route.
3. The program must determine which bus route Serval will take based on the earliest bus that arrives after or at time `t`.
4. If multiple buses arrive at the same earliest time, any of those routes can be returned.

### Analysis of the Annotated Program
- **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`, which aligns with the problem description.
- **Logic**:
  - It initializes `min_wait_time` to infinity and `chosen_route` to -1.
  - For each bus route:
    - If the first bus arrives after or at time `t`, it calculates the wait time directly.
    - If the first bus has already arrived, the wait time is determined based on the interval `d_i`.
  - It tracks the route with the minimum wait time.
  
#### Key Checks:
1. **Wait Time Calculation**:
   - The calculation correctly considers if the first bus arrives after `t`.
   - It also correctly handles the case when the first bus has already arrived and computes the wait time for subsequent buses.

2. **Choosing the Route**:
   - The route with the minimal wait time is chosen correctly.
   - The program returns the index of the bus route (1-based), which is what the problem requires.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine which bus route Serval will take according to the problem description. It checks each route, calculates the appropriate wait times, and accurately identifies the route with the least wait time.

Correctness: **True**
