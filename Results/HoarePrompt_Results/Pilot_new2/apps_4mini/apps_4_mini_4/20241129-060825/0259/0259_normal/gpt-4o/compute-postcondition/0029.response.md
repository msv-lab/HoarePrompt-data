The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The variable `s_i` was previously assigned the value `bus_routes[2][0]`, while `t` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `wait_time` without knowing `t`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[2][0]`, `d_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[2][1]`, and `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`.**
