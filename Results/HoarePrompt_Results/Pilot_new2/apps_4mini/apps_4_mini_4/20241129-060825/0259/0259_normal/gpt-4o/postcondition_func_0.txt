The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` indicating the time Serval arrives at the station, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the first bus arrival time and the interval of subsequent buses for each route. It calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route with the shortest wait time. If there are no bus routes (when `n` is 0), the function will return -1, indicating that no bus route is available.
