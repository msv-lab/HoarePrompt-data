The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is assigned from `bus_routes[0]` and is greater than or equal to `t`. This means that `wait_time` will be a non-negative value since `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, `t` is a value less than or equal to `s_i`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative value equal to `s_i - t`.**
