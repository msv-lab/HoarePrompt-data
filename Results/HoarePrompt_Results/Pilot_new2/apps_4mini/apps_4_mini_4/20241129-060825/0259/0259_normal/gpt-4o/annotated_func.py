#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes (1 <= n <= 100), t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station (1 <= t <= 10^5), and bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i and d_i) representing the first bus arrival time and the interval of subsequent buses for each route (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5).
def func_1(n, t, bus_routes):
    min_wait_time = float('inf')
    chosen_route = -1
    for i in range(n):
        s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]
        
        if s_i >= t:
            wait_time = s_i - t
        elif (t - s_i) % d_i == 0:
            wait_time = 0
        else:
            wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
        
        if wait_time < min_wait_time:
            min_wait_time = wait_time
            chosen_route = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time for the next bus across all routes, `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the first bus arrival time and the interval of subsequent buses. If there are no routes (n = 0), then `min_wait_time` remains float('inf') and `chosen_route` remains -1.
    return chosen_route
    #The program returns the index of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time, which is represented by 'chosen_route'. If there are no routes, 'chosen_route' remains -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` indicating the time Serval arrives at the station, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the first bus arrival time and the interval of subsequent buses for each route. It calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route with the shortest wait time. If there are no bus routes (when `n` is 0), the function will return -1, indicating that no bus route is available.
