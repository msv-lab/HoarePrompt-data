Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[2][0]`, and `d_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[2][1]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. Otherwise, if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
