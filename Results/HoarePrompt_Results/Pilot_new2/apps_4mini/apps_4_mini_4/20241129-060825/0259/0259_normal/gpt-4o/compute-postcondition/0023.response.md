Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[1]`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. Otherwise, if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0; if not, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.***
