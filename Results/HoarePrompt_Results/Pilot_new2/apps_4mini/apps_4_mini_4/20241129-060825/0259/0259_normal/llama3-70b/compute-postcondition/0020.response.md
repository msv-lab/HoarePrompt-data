According to the code, the loop iterates over the `buses` list, which contains at least 1 tuple. The variable `i` is currently 0, indicating that the loop has just processed the first tuple in the `buses` list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, thus becoming 1. Additionally, since `buses` has at least 1 tuple, to execute again, it must have at least 2 tuples in total for there to be a second tuple available for processing. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the updated state should reflect that `i` is now 1 and that `buses` must contain at least 2 tuples.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of the form (s, d), `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`**.
