The variables `n` and `t` are assigned values based on the input, which should be two integers separated by a space. The previous values of `n` and `t` are not specified, but they are constrained by the initial state to be an integer between 1 and 100 for `n` and a positive integer between 1 and 100000 for `t`. Therefore, after execution, `n` and `t` will hold the values based on the input provided. The other variables related to bus routes (`s_i` and `d_i`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 100 based on input; `t` is assigned a positive integer value between 1 and 100000 based on input; `s_i` and `d_i` remain positive integers between 1 and 100000**.
