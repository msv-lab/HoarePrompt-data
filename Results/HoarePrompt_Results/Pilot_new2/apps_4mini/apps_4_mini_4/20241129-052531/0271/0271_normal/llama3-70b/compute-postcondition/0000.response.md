The value of `n` is assigned as `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and is converted to an integer. The initial condition states that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). After the execution of the code, `n` will hold the value of the integer input provided by the user, which must still satisfy the condition \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). Therefore, the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
