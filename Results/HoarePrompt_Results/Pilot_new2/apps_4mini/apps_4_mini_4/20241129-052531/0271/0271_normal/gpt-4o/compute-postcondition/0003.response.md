`result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Given that `remainder` is `n % 10` and is confirmed to be between 0 and 5 (inclusive), `result` will be a value derived from `n` that is `n` minus a value that is at most 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10` which is a value between 0 and 9 inclusive and less than or equal to 5; `result` is `n - remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`, which is a value between 0 and 5; `result` is `n - remainder`.**
