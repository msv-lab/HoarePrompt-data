To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code against the specifications given.

The problem requires us to evaluate the votes from three groups:
- `x`: people who will definitely upvote
- `y`: people who will definitely downvote
- `z`: people whose voting behavior is uncertain (they could either upvote or downvote)

We need to compute the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes:

1. **Minimum Upvotes**: This is simply `x` (the known upvoters).
2. **Maximum Upvotes**: This is `x + z` because all uncertain voters could upvote.
3. **Minimum Downvotes**: This is `y` (the known downvoters).
4. **Maximum Downvotes**: This is `y + z` because all uncertain voters could downvote.

Next, we need to determine the outcomes based on these calculations:
- If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (`min_downvotes`), then the result is definitely a downvote (`-`).
- If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes`), then the result is definitely an upvote (`+`).
- If neither of these conditions is met, then the result is uncertain (`?`).

Now, let's check if the code adheres to that logic:

```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
min_upvotes = x
max_upvotes = x + z
min_downvotes = y
max_downvotes = y + z
if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
    print('-')
elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
    print('+')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Evaluating the Logic
1. If `3 7 0` is input:
   - min_upvotes = 3
   - max_upvotes = 3
   - min_downvotes = 7
   - max_downvotes = 7
   - `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` is true (`3 < 7`), so output is `-`. This is correct.

2. If `2 0 1` is input:
   - min_upvotes = 2
   - max_upvotes = 3
   - min_downvotes = 0
   - max_downvotes = 1
   - `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` is true (`1 < 2`), so output is `+`. This is correct.

3. If `1 1 0` is input:
   - min_upvotes = 1
   - max_upvotes = 1
   - min_downvotes = 1
   - max_downvotes = 1
   - Neither condition is true, so output is `?`. This is correct.

4. If `0 0 1` is input:
   - min_upvotes = 0
   - max_upvotes = 1
   - min_downvotes = 0
   - max_downvotes = 1
   - Neither condition is true, so output is `?`. This is correct.

### Conclusion
After going through the provided examples and confirming that the program logic directly matches the requirements of the problem description without any discrepancies or missing cases, we can conclude that the program works as intended for all tested scenarios.

Correctness: **True**.
