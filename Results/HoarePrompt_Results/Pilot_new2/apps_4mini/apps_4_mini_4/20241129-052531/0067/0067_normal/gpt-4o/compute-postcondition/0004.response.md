The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The initial state indicates that `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100 and `z` is also an integer in the range 0 to 100. Therefore, the value of `max_downvotes` will be an integer in the range 0 to 200, since the smallest value occurs when both `y` and `z` are 0, and the largest value occurs when both `y` and `z` are 100.

The previous states of the other variables are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:
- `x` is an integer in the range 0 to 100
- `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100
- `z` is an integer in the range 0 to 100
- `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`
- `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`
- `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`
- `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
