Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`; and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, '0' has been printed; otherwise, a question mark '?' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the program does not print anything specific.***
