The code snippet is a print statement that outputs the string '+'. It does not modify any variables or change their values; it simply produces an output. Thus, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; the value of `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`; and the current value of `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, and the output is '+'**.
