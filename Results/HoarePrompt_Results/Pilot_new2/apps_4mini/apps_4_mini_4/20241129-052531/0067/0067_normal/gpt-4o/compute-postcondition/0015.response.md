Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers as input (x, y, and z) which represent upvotes and downvotes, and it outputs a character based on the relative values of the calculated maximum and minimum upvotes and downvotes. It prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met. The function does not return any value.**
