According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1 to 2. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`, which means `n` must be greater than 4 (since `n // 2` would then equal 2).

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2**
