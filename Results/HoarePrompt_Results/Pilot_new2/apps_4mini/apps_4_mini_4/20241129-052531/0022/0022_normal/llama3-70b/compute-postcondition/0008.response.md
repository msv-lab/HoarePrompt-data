According to the code, the loop executes while `i` is less than `n // 2`. If `n` is at least 2, then `n // 2` will be at least 1, meaning that the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was less than `n // 2`, allowing the loop to continue. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since the loop iterates using `i`, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i`, after the next iteration, it will be `i + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `n // 2` to allow another iteration.

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1, and `n` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop can potentially run again.**
