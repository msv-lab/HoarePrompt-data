To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the requirements for an "s-palindrome" and evaluate the provided code.

**Problem Description Recap:**
A string is "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about its middle. The example clarifies that "oHo" is an s-palindrome, but "aa" is not since the second half is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

**Code Analysis:**
The function `func_1(s)` checks if the first half of the string is the same as the mirrored second half:
1. It calculates the length of the string `n`.
2. It iterates through the first half of the string using `for i in range(n // 2)`.
3. In each iteration, it compares the character at position `i` with the character at position `n - 1 - i`.
4. If any characters do not match, it returns `False`, indicating the string is not an s-palindrome. If all characters match, it returns `True`.

**Potential Issues:**
1. The function currently checks for exact character matches using `!=`. This does not account for case differences. For example:
   - Input: "oXxOxo"
   - The function would consider this as `False`, but if case insensitivity is needed, it should be `True`. 
   
2. The examples provided in the problem statement indicate that the second half must be a mirror reflection of the first half. The current implementation does not account for the idea of "mirror reflection" beyond simple character comparison, again indicating case sensitivity issues.

**Conclusion:**
The provided program does not handle the requirement for character case checking appropriately, and therefore fails to correctly identify strings that should be considered s-palindromes.

Correctness: **False** 

**Example of Failure:** 
Input: "oXxOxo" should return "TAK" (as it is symmetric when ignoring case), but the current implementation would output "NIE".
