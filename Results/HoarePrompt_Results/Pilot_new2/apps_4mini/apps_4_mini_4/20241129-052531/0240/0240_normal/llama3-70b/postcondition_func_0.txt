The function accepts a non-empty string of digits `s` and a non-empty substring `t`. It constructs a new string by concatenating all characters from `s` that are present in `t`, followed by the substring `t`. The function then returns the integer value of this resulting string. If no characters from `s` are found in `t`, the function will return the integer value of `t` alone.
