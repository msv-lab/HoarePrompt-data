The function accepts two non-empty strings `s` and `sub`, both consisting of digits. It calculates the frequency of each digit in `s` and subtracts the frequency of each digit in `sub`. It then constructs a string of the remaining digits from `s` after removing the characters found in `sub`, generates all possible numbers from these remaining digits, and returns the smallest integer from that list. The function may encounter cases where no valid numbers can be generated if all digits from `s` are removed by `sub`, but the current implementation does not handle such cases explicitly.
