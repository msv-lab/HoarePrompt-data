The variable `counts` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which converts user input into a list of integers. The input values are unknown, so we can't specify exact values for `counts`, but we know that `counts` will contain integers. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `m` is an integer between 1 and n; `colors` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `counts` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**
