The variable `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. Since `window_counts[color]` was either `1` or `2` depending on the previous count of `color`, it is now updated to `0`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `color`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[1]`, and `window_counts[color]` is now 0.**
