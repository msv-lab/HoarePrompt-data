The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state retains their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `color` is `colors[n - 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1, all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, and `found` is `True`.
