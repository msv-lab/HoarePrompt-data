You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.


-----Example-----
Input
5 2
1 1 2 2 1
1 2

Output
YES
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100, m is an integer between 1 and n, the second line contains n integers each in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing the colors of the lightsabers, and the third line contains m integers representing the desired counts k_1, k_2, ..., k_m, where 1 <= sum(k_i) <= n.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    colors = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counts = list(map(int, input().split()))
    color_counts = {}
    for color in colors:
        if color not in color_counts:
            color_counts[color] = 0
        
        color_counts[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing at least `n` integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from user input, and `color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list, and the value is the count of how many times that color appears in the `colors` list.
    found = False
    for i in range(n):
        window_counts = {}
        
        for j in range(i, n):
            color = colors[j]
            if color not in window_counts:
                window_counts[color] = 0
            window_counts[color] += 1
            if all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.
                values()), counts)):
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `found` is True if there exists a window in `colors` that matches the counts in the `counts` list, otherwise `found` is False. `window_counts` contains counts of colors from the `colors` list corresponding to the last evaluated window when `found` is True or remains empty if `found` is False. `i` is the index of the first window where a match was found, or equals `n` if no match was found.
    print('YES' if found else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` (1 to 100) and `m` (1 to `n`), a list of `n` integers representing the colors of lightsabers, and a list of `m` integers representing desired counts. It checks if there exists a contiguous subarray of the `colors` list where the frequency of each unique color matches the corresponding desired counts. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
