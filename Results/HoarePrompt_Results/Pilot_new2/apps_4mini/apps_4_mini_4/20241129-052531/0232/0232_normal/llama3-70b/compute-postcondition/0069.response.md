The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 1, `found` is True, `color` is equal to `colors[2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
