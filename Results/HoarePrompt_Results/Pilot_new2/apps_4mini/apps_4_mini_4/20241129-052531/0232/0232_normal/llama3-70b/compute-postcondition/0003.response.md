The statement `color_counts = {}` initializes `color_counts` as an empty dictionary. Other variables `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `m` is an integer between 1 and n; `colors` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `counts` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `m` is an integer between 1 and n; `colors` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `counts` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.**
