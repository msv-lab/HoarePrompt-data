According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `i` and continues while `j` is less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the condition for the loop to execute is that `j` must be less than `n` when the loop starts.

Since `i` is 1, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. At the start of the first iteration, `j` will be equal to `i`, which is 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False**
