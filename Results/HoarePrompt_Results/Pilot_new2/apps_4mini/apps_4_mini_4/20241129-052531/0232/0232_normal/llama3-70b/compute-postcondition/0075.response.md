The statement `window_counts[color] += 1` increases the value of `window_counts` for the specific `color`, which is `colors[3]`. The initial values indicate that `color` is present in `window_counts` with a value of 0. After executing the code, `window_counts[color]` will be 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 1, where `color` is equal to `colors[3]`.**
