Output State: **`left` is equal to the original value of `n` (since all colors have been processed), `right` is equal to 0, `current_counts` for each color is less than or equal to its corresponding value in `desired_counts`, and the loop will not execute further since all colors meet the desired counts condition. If at least one color's current count was less than its desired count, `current_counts` would reflect that, but if all colors matched their desired counts, the function would have returned 'YES' during execution.**
