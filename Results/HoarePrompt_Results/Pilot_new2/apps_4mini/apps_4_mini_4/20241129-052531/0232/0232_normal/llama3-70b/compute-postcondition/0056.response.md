`window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`, meaning that the dictionary `window_counts` now has a key `color` with a value of `0`. Since `color` was not present in `window_counts`, this will add the new entry. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `window_counts` now contains `color` with a value of 0, `found` is False, and `color` is equal to `colors[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 0, `found` is False, and `color` is equal to `colors[1]**
