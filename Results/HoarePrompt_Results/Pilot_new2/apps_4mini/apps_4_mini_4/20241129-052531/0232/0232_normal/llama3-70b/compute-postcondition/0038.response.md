Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is now 1 if `color` was previously not in `window_counts`, or it is now 2 if `color` was already in `window_counts`. If all counts in `window_counts` match their respective target counts, `found` is set to True and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.***
