The variable `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. Since `color` is equal to `colors[4]`, the specific value of `color` is determined by the value at index `4` of the list `colors`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4; `i` is 2; `j` is 4; `color` is equal to `colors[4]`; `window_counts[color]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4; `i` is 2; `j` is 4; `color` is equal to `colors[4]`; `window_counts[color]` is 0.**
