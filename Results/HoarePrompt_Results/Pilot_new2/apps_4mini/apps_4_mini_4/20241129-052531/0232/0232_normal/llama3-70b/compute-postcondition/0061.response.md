The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 1, `found` is True, and all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts` when sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
