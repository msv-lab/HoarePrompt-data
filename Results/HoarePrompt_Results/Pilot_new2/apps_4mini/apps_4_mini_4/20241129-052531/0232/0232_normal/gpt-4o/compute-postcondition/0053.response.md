The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Since it was adjusted to be less than or equal to `n`, after the increment, it will be greater than or equal to 1 and still less than or equal to `n + 1`. The states of `right`, `current_counts`, and `desired_counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is adjusted to be between 1 and `n + 1`, `right` is 2, and `current_counts[colors[left - 1]]` remains decreased by 1.

Output State: **`left` is adjusted to be between 1 and `n + 1`, `right` is 2, `current_counts[colors[left - 1]]` is decreased by 1.**
