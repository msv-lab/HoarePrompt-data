Correctness: **False**

The program fails to account for the requirement that any character in the string `s` can be replaced by the next character in alphabetical order. This means that even if `s` does not contain a specific character from the target string `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`, we can still replace existing characters to reach that character.

For example, consider the input `s = "aaa"`. The program will output `-1` because it does not find the subsequence `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`, but it is possible to change `aaa` to `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` by making the following transformations:

- Replace the first 'a' with 'b'.
- Replace the second 'a' with 'c'.
- Replace the third 'a' with 'd'.
- Continue replacing until we reach 'z'.

Therefore, since the program does not consider the possibility of replacing characters to meet the requirement (when `s` is not already a valid subsequence), it does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.
