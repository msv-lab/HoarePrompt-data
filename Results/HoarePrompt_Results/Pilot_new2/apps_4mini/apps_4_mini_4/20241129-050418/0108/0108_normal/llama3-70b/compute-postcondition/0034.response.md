The code updates `s` by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table, which is achieved by calculating `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. Additionally, `res` is updated to include `char`, which implies that `res` now contains the previous value of `char` appended to its original value. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has been updated to include the character following `char`, and `res` has been updated to include `char`.

Output State: **`s` has been updated to include the character following `char`; `res` has been updated to include `char`.**
