`j` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `len(s) > i` and that `j` must be less than `target_len`, but the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `target_len` are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to `j` while maintaining the conditions on `s`, `i`, and `target_len`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `i` is now greater than its previous value by 1; `len(s) must be greater than i; j is now greater than its previous value by 1; j must be less than target_len**
