`res` is assigned the value of itself plus `char`, meaning the current value of `res` will now include the value of `char`. Since `s` must include `char`, this means `char` is a character contained within `s`, but the specific contents of `res` before this operation are not provided. Therefore, `res` will now be equal to its previous value plus `char`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` must include `char`; `res` now includes the previous value of `res` plus `char`.**
