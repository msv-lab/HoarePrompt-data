The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but its state will change as it will now be one greater than its previous value. The other variables, including `s`, `target`, and any related logic, remain unaffected in this instance, as the code only changes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `i` is now greater than its previous value by 1.**
