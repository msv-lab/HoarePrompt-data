According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop condition specifies that both `i` must be less than `len(s)` and `j` must be less than `target_len` for the loop to continue.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is now greater than its previous value by 1. This means that `i` has already increased, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `len(s)`. 

We do not have information about the values of `j` and `target_len` after the previous iteration, but we can infer that for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `target_len`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- `i` must still be less than `len(s)`, which means `len(s)` must be greater than its previous value of `i`.
- `j` must be less than `target_len`.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for `i` itself but we need to ensure:
1. `len(s)` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
2. `j` must be less than `target_len`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `i` is now greater than its previous value by 1; `len(s) must be greater than i and j must be less than target_len`**
