The code snippet `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the string `res`. The initial state indicates that `s` must contain `char`, but does not provide information about `res`. As a result, the value of `res` will be updated to include `char`, while `s` still retains its original condition of containing `char`. 

Output State: **`s` must contain `char`; `res` is updated to include `char`.**
