The function accepts no parameters and processes an internal string `s` input by the user, consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string `res` by replacing each character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet while preserving the order of their first occurrence. If `res` contains all 26 letters of the alphabet, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. If the input string lacks sufficient unique characters, the function will print -1, indicating that not all letters from 'a' to 'z' were represented.
