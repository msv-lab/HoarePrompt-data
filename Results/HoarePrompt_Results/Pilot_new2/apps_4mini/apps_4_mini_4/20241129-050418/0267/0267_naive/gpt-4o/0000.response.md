To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the requirements of the problem description:

The goal is to calculate the sum of integers from \( l \) to \( r \) (inclusive) that contain at most \( k \) different digits and return the result modulo \( 998244353 \).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function checks if the number \( n \) has at most \( k \) different digits by converting the number to a string, turning it into a set (which removes duplicates), and comparing the length of this set to \( k \).
   - This logic seems correct for identifying if a number has at most \( k \) different digits.

2. **Function `func_2(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function initializes a total sum to zero and iterates through each number from \( l \) to \( r \).
   - For each number, it calls `func_1` to check if the number has at most \( k \) different digits. If it does, the number is added to `total_sum`, which is then taken modulo \( 998244353 \).
   - This logic adheres to the requirements of the problem.

### Potential Edge Cases:
However, the program has a significant performance issue because it iterates through each number in the range from \( l \) to \( r \). Given that \( l \) and \( r \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), this could result in an impractically large number of iterations, leading to timeouts or extremely long processing times.

For example:
- If \( l = 1 \) and \( r = 10^{18} \), the program would attempt to evaluate \( 10^{18} \) numbers, which is not feasible.

### Conclusion:
Due to the inefficiency of the approach for large values of \( r \) (e.g., \( r - l \) could be very large), the program cannot handle the upper limits of the input constraints as specified in the problem statement. This leads to a scenario where the program fails to provide a correct output for some input cases.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements due to its inability to handle cases with large ranges efficiently.

Correctness: **False**.
