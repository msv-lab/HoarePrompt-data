Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies in how the program handles the range from `l` to `r`. 

Specifically, the code has a significant performance problem due to its use of a loop that iterates through every integer between `l` and `r`. Given the constraints where `r` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), this can lead to an enormous number of iterations, making the program infeasible for large ranges.

Moreover, while the function `func_1` correctly determines if a number has at most `k` different digits, `func_2` does not make any optimizations to avoid checking all numbers in a potentially vast range. 

An edge case is when `l` and `r` are very close but `k` is small. For instance, if `l = 10^18 - 1` and `r = 10^18`, the program would need to evaluate both numbers, but due to the high difference in their digit composition, it would not handle it efficiently.

Additionally, the program does not address cases where `l` and `r` are such that there are no valid numbers to sum. For example, if `l = 100` and `r = 110` with `k = 1`, the only possible valid numbers (111) are outside the range, leading to a sum of 0, which would not be handled correctly without explicitly checking for such conditions.

Therefore, due to these concerns regarding inefficiency and potential lack of checks on edge cases, the program is not correct.
