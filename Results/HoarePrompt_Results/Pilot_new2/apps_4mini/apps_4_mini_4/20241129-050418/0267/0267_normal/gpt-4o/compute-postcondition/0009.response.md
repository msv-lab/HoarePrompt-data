The variable `num` is assigned the value `r + 1`. Since `r` is defined such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, the value of `num` will be within the range `2` to `10^18` (if `r + 1` â‰¤ `10^18`).

The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to its current value and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The specific value of `total_sum` will depend on its previous value, which is not provided. The modulus operation ensures that the new value of `total_sum` will remain within the bounds defined by `MOD`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `num` and `total_sum`, while all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10; `num` is `r + 1`; `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.**
