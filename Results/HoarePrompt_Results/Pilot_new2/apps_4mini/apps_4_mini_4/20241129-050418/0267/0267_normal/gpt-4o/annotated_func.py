#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns whether the number of unique digits in the integer n (which is between l and r) is less than or equal to k, where l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and it returns `True` if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`. If `n` has more unique digits than `k`, it returns `False`. The function correctly handles the constraints that `n` can be very large (up to 10^18) and `k` can range from 1 to 10.

    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_sum` is equal to the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If no numbers in the range satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, then `total_sum` remains 0.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns total_sum, which is equal to the sum of all integers num in the range from l to r for which func_1(num, k) returns true. If no integers satisfy this condition, total_sum remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` defining a range (with `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`) and an integer `k` (with `1 <= k <= 10`). It calculates and returns the sum of all integers `num` within the range from `l` to `r` for which the condition defined in `func_1(num, k)` returns true. If no integers satisfy this condition, the function returns 0. The sum is taken modulo `MOD` to prevent overflow.
