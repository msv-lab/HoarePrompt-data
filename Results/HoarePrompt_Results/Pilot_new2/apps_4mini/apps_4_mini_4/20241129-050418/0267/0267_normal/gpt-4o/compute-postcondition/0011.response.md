Output State: **`total_sum` is equal to the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If no numbers in the range satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, then `total_sum` remains 0.**
