According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop will iterate as long as `num` is within the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, and `r` is also such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` must be equal to `r` for the loop to terminate, so to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `num` must be `r + 1`, and for the loop to be valid, `r` must be strictly less than `10^18`. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is set to `l % MOD`, and `num` is equal to `r + 1` if `r + 1` <= `10^18`**
