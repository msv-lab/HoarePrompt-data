Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10; if `func_1(num, k)` is true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(l % MOD + (r + 1)) % MOD`, and `num` is `r + 1` if `r + 1` <= `10^18`.***
