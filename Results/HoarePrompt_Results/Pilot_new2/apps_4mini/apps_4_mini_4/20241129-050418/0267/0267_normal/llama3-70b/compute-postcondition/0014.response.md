According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `k`. The loop will iterate while `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to 1 (the start of the loop), and since `k` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. 

In the next iteration, `i` will increase by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 2.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 < `k` <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 * 10 + 9 * 10, i is 2, and k must be greater than 2**
