To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the code step by step.

1. We know that `max_lemons` is defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This means `max_lemons` will take the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`.
2. The variable `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)` or `max_lemons * 7`.

Since `max_lemons` is a derived value based on the input variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `total_fruits` is directly calculated from `max_lemons`, the values change as follows:

- `total_fruits` will now hold a value equal to `max_lemons * 7`.

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their input values, but we can express `max_lemons` in terms of those values. 

Thus, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer (input value), `b` is a positive integer (input value), `c` is an input integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000), `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`.**
