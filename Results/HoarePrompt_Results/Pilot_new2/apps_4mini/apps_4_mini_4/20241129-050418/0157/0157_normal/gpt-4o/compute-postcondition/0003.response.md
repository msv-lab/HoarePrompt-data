The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers and `c` is an integer in the range of 1 to 1000, the values of `b // 2` and `c // 4` will depend on the specific values of `b` and `c`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer (input value), `b` is a positive integer (input value), `c` is an input integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000), and `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer (input value), `b` is a positive integer (input value), `c` is an input integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000), `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`**.
