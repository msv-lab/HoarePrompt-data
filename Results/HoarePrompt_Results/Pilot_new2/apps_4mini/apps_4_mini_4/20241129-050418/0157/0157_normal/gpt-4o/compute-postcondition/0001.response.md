The value of `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this code. The value of `b` is now a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer (input value), `b` is a positive integer (input integer), `c` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000)**
