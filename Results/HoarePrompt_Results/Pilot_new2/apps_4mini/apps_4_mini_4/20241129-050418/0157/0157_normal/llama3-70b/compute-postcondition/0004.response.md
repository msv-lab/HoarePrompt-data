To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we first need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000)
- `b` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000)
- `c` is an input integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000)
- `min_lemon` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

The code snippet:
```
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

The expression inside the print function calculates the total using `min_lemon`. Specifically, it evaluates to:
- `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` 
- This simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)` or `min_lemon * 7`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is `min_lemon * 7`.

Since `min_lemon` is defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, we can express the output in terms of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same but with the addition of the calculated output based on `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `c` is an input integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000), `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), and the output is min_lemon * 7.**
