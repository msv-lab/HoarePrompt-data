To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program accurately computes the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used according to the specified ratio (1:2:4).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads three integers from input representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). This matches the problem description.

2. **Ratio Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon`) based on the available fruits:
     - It uses `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`:
       - `a` is the number of lemons.
       - `b // 2` calculates how many lemons can be paired with available apples since each lemon requires 2 apples.
       - `c // 4` calculates how many lemons can be paired with available pears since each lemon requires 4 pears.
   - This correctly reflects the requirement of the recipe that for every lemon, there needs to be 2 apples and 4 pears.

3. **Total Calculation**:
   - The total number of fruits used in the compote is then computed as:
     ```
     min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4
     ```
   - This expands to:
     ```
     min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7
     ```
   - Consequently, the program outputs `min_lemon * 7`, which corresponds to the total number of fruits used in the compote.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the calculated `min_lemon` is `0`, this indicates that not enough fruits are available to meet the ratio.
   - The program will output `0` correctly in this case, as it will compute `0 * 7 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program successfully follows the logic required by the problem description, correctly calculating the maximum number of fruits that can be used based on the constraints of the recipe.

Thus, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
