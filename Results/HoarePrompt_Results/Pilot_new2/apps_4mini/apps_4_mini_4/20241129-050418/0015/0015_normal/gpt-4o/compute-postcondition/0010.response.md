The code outputs the string 'NO' to the console, which does not affect the state of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The preconditions regarding the integer values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with their relationships, remain valid. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variables have changed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is not equal to 0; and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0; and 'NO' is printed.**
