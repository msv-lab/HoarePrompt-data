The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned based on the input provided through `map(int, input().split())`, which takes a space-separated string of integers and converts them into integers. The prior states of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not known, as they can be any integers within the specified range of -10^9 to 10^9. Therefore, after executing the code, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold new integer values based on the input given. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that have been assigned new values based on input provided.**
