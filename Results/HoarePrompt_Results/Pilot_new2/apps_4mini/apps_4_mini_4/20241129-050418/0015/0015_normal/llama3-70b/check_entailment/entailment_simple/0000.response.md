Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement regarding the arithmetic sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. Let's break down how the program corresponds to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which matches the input format described.

2. **Case when c = 0**: 
   - If `c` is zero, the sequence becomes constant where all terms are equal to `a`. Thus, the only way for `b` to appear in the sequence is if `a` is equal to `b`. The program checks this condition:
     - If `a == b`, it prints "YES".
     - If `a != b`, it prints "NO".
   This correctly implements the requirement for this particular case.

3. **Case when c â‰  0**: 
   - For the case where `c` is not zero, the program checks whether `b` appears in the sequence using the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`. 
   - The first condition `(b - a) % c == 0` checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by repeatedly adding `c`, ensuring that `b` is a term in the arithmetic sequence.
   - The second condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that `i`, the positive integer representing the number of steps from `a` to reach `b`, is non-negative. This means we are moving in the correct direction (considering the sign of `c`).

4. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based on these checks, which aligns perfectly with the specifications given in the problem statement.

Overall, the program accurately checks for the presence of `b` in the arithmetic sequence defined by `a` and `c`, handling the edge cases appropriately, which confirms that it meets the requirements of the problem description.
