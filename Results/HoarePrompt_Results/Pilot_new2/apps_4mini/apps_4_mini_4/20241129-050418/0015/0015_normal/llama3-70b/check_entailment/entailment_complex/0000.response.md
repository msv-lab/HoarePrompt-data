Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by its first element `a` and the common difference `c`.

Here’s why the program is correct:

1. **Handling the case where `c = 0`:**
   - When `c` is zero, the sequence does not change, meaning all elements in this sequence are equal to `a`.
   - The program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it correctly prints "YES", indicating that `b` appears in the sequence. If they are not equal, it prints "NO", which is also correct since `b` cannot appear in the constant sequence.

2. **Handling the case where `c ≠ 0`:**
   - For a non-zero `c`, the elements of the sequence can be expressed as `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c`. The goal is to find if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.
   - Rearranging this condition gives `b = a + (i - 1) * c`, which leads to the equation `(b - a) = (i - 1) * c`.
   - This implies that `(b - a)` must be divisible by `c` (i.e., `(b - a) % c == 0`) and that `i` must be positive (which translates into ensuring that `(b - a) / c >= 0`).
   - The program correctly checks these two conditions. If both are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles scenarios where `a`, `b`, and `c` are at the boundary of their constraints (e.g., `-10^9` to `10^9`), as all operations used (subtraction, modulo, division) are safe within these bounds.

Overall, the program has a comprehensive approach to determine whether `b` appears in the infinite arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference of `c`, thus fully aligning with the requirements set forth in the problem description.
