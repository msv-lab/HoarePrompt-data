The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not modified by this operation. However, the conditions regarding `b`, `a`, and `c` remain valid as they were not affected by the print statement.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers, `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, the current value of `(b - a) % c` is 0, the current value of `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, and 'YES' has been printed.**
