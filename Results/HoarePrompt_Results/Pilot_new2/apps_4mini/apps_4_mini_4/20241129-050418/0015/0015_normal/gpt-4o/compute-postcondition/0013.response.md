Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is 0, there are no further operations related to `b` and `a`. If `c` is not 0, then 'YES' is printed if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
