The function accepts three integer inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. If `c` is equal to 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b`; if they are equal, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; if both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
