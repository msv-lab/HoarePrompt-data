The code `break` causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional statement that it is currently within. The values of the affected variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `i` is 0, `found` is True, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
