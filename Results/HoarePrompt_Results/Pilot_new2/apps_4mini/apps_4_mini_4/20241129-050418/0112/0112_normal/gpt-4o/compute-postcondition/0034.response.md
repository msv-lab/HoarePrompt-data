The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. Since `found` was already set to `True`, its value remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters; `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list; `found` is set to True; `i` is 1; `used_cubes[i]` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
