The `print(max_num)` statement outputs the value of `max_num`, which is an integer obtained by sorting the `digits` list in descending order and joining them into a single number. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers; `digits` contains string representations of integers from `cubes`, excluding '0' if present; `max_num` is the integer value obtained by sorting `digits` in descending order and joining them into a single number; `max_num` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers; `digits` contains string representations of integers from `cubes`, excluding '0' if present; `max_num` is printed.**
