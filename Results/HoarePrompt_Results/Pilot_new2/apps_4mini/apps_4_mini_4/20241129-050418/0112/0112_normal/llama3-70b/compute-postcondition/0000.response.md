The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds an integer value entered by the user. Given the initial state, `n` was previously an integer in the range 1 to 3, and that remains valid after execution since the input must conform to those bounds. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 3, n is an input integer**
