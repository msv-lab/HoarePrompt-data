Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, and `i` is at least 3. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
