Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `i` is 0, `found` is set to True, and `used_cubes[i]` is updated to True if `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` and `used_cubes[i]` was previously False. If `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged and `found` remains False.***
