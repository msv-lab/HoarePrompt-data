According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. Since `n` is defined as an integer in the range 1 to 3, it guarantees that the `cubes` list will contain at least 1 list (since it is based on the value of `n`). Therefore, the loop can execute. At the beginning of the first iteration, `cube` will be the first list in the `cubes`. 

Thus, to accurately reflect the state at the start of the loop execution, we need to ensure that `cube` is set to the first list in the `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is an empty set, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`**
