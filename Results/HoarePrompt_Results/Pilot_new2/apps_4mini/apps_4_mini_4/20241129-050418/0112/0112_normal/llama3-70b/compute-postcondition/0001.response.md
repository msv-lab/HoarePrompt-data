The value of `cubes` is assigned a list that is created by iterating `n` times (where `n` is between 1 and 3) and accepting input in the form of space-separated integers for each iteration. The previous value of `n` remains the same (an integer in the range 1 to 3), and `cubes` will now hold a list of lists based on the input given. Since the specific values for the input are not known, we cannot provide exact values for `cubes`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers based on input values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers based on input values.**
