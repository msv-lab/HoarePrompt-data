Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Leading Zeros**: The problem states that the number cannot contain leading zeros. The program removes '0' from the set of digits but does not correctly account for leading zeros when constructing the maximum number. For example, if the cubes have digits that allow constructing a number like "01", the program would incorrectly allow this despite the stated restriction.

2. **Constructing All Numbers**: The problem requires determining the largest natural number \( x \) such that all integers from 1 to \( x \) can be formed using the cubes. However, the program tries to create a single maximum number instead of checking the sequential integers to find the largest \( x \). The program simply creates the highest possible number from the available digits without validating whether all numbers from 1 to that maximum can be formed.

3. **Ignoring Cube Usage Rules**: The problem does not allow forming digits 6 and 9 from each other, which is not addressed in the program. The program does not check how many times each digit can be formed based on available cubes, which is crucial for determining whether a number can be constructed.

To summarize, the program fails to meet the requirements of checking whether all integers from 1 to \( x \) can be built from the available cubes and does not handle the constraints regarding leading zeros or the specific digit restrictions. Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem description as required.
