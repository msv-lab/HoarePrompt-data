The function `func` accepts an integer input `n` (which must be in the range of 1 to 3) and then reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains 6 integers (each from 0 to 9), representing the digits on the faces of `n` cubes. It processes these digits by accumulating them into a set called `digits`, which ensures that each unique digit appears only once.

After collecting the digits, if the digit '0' is present, it is removed from the set. The function then constructs the largest possible integer that can be formed using the remaining digits by sorting them in descending order and joining them together. Finally, it prints this maximum number.

However, the function has no defined return value; it only prints the result. This might lead to confusion because the postconditions do not specify that the function merely prints the result rather than returning it.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 to 3), reads `n` lines of six integers each representing cube face digits, collects unique digits, removes '0' if present, and prints the largest number that can be formed from the remaining digits. The function does not return any value. **
