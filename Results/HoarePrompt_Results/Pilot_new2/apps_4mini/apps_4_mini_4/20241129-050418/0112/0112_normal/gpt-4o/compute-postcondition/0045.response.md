Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, indicating that at least one `used_cubes[i]` was set to True during the loop execution; the `used_cubes` array reflects the state of cubes used to match the digit, where at least one element is True and the others may be either True or False.***
