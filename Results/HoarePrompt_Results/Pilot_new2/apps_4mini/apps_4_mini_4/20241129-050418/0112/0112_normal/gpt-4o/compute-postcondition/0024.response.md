According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has more digits, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 character (since it must have at least 1), `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next digit in the `digits` list. If `digit` is the first character, the next `digit` will be the second character in the list (assuming it exists). Thus, `n` must reflect the index of the next digit, which would be 2 if `n` were originally 1, 3 if `n` were originally 2, and must remain 3 if `n` were originally 3. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the state must reflect that `digit` is now the second character in the `digits` list (if it exists), and `n` must be updated accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `found` is true, and `used_cubes` reflects the state of cubes that were successfully used.**
