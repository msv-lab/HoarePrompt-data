The variable `used_cubes[i]` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state indicates that the current value of `used_cubes[i]` was `false`, so now it changes to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `found` is false, `i` is 0, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`.**
