The annotated program provided does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the program step-by-step based on the given problem.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Masha has up to 3 cubes, each with 6 faces showing digits from 0 to 9.
   - She needs to determine the largest integer "x" such that she can form every integer from 1 to x using the digits on the cubes without leading zeros.

2. **Functionality of the Program**:
   - `func_1(n, cubes)` is supposed to calculate the maximum consecutive integers starting from 1 that can be formed using the cubes. 
   - The `can_form_number(num)` function is meant to determine if a specific number can be formed using the cubes without reusing any cubes for different digits in that number.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The `cube_faces` variable is defined within `func_1`, but it is accessed in `can_form_number(num)` without being passed as a parameter. This will lead to a `NameError` since `cube_faces` is not defined within the scope of `can_form_number(num)`.
   - The program does not handle the restrictions correctly regarding leading zeros. Specifically, if the cubes contain the digit '0', the program must ensure that '0' is not used as the first digit of any number being formed.
   - There is no validation to check if the integer formed can begin from 1, nor does it handle cases where certain digits may not be available in sufficient quantity (e.g., needing two cubes to form '88').

4. **Conclusion**:
Because the program does not correctly share the cube faces between functions and fails to properly check for leading zeros or the availability of multiple instances of the same digit when needed, we can conclude that the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
