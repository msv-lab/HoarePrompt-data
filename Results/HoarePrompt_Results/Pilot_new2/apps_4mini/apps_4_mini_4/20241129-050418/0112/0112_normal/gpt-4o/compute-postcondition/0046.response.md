According to the code, the loop executes based on the number of characters in the `digits` list. The loop iterates over each character, and at the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the second character in the list, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, which indicates that the `digits` list has at least 2 characters (specifically, the second character). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `digits` must have at least 3 characters, since the current `digit` corresponds to the second character. After the last iteration, where `digit` is the second character, the loop will proceed to the third character in the next iteration. Therefore, we need to indicate that `digit` will now represent the third character in `digits`, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to run once more.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `found` is True**
