#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and cubes is a list of n elements where each element is a list of 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes, with each integer a_{i}_{j} satisfying 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9.
def func_1(n, cubes):
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]
    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `x` is the maximum number of consecutive integers starting from 1 that can be formed using the faces of the cubes in `cubes`; `can_form_number(x + 1)` must be False for the loop to terminate.
    return x
    #The program returns the maximum number of consecutive integers starting from 1 that can be formed using the faces of the cubes in 'cubes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `cubes` containing `n` lists, each with 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). It returns the maximum number `x` of consecutive integers starting from 1 that can be formed using the faces of those cubes. The function relies on an external method `can_form_number` to determine if each integer can be formed, which is not defined in the provided code and may introduce missing functionality related to checking the ability to represent each consecutive integer. Therefore, the function's behavior in relation to invalid input or the specifics of how `can_form_number` operates is not accounted for in the annotations.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `found` is true for all matched digits, and `used_cubes` reflects whether each cube was successfully used (True) or not (False).
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all matched digits have been found successfully.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num`, checks if all its digits can be formed using the faces of a given number of cubes (up to 3). It returns True if all digits are matched successfully with the cubes' faces, or False if any digit cannot be matched with the available cubes, or if a cube has already been used for a previous digit.
