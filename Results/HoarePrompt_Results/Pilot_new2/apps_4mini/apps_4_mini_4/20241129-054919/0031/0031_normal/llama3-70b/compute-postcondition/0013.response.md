The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the `numerator` and `denominator`. The values of `numerator` and `denominator` are defined as follows:

- `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\)
- `numerator` is equal to \((2^n \cdot (2^n - 1) \cdot (2^n - 2) \cdots (2^n - (k - 1)))\)
- `denominator` is equal to \(2^{kn}\)

While the code computes the gcd, it does not modify the original values of `numerator` or `denominator`, it only calculates `gcd`.

Thus, the output state remains with the original definitions of `numerator` and `denominator`, but now includes the computed `gcd` value:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is equal to \((2^n \cdot (2^n - 1) \cdot (2^n - 2) \cdots (2^n - (k - 1)))\), `denominator` is equal to \(2^{kn}\), `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.**
