The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It handles all valid integer inputs within the specified range and reliably computes the GCD, as `b` will eventually become zero, at which point `a` contains the GCD of the original values.
