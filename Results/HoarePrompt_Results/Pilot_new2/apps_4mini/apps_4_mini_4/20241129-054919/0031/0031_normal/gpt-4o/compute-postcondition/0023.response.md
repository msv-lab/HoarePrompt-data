To provide the output state, let's analyze the initial state and the given code.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18
- `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18
- `MOD` is 1000003
- `total_days` is equal to `2^n`
- `numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i) % 1000003` for `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`
- `denominator` is equal to `(2^n)^k % 1000003`
- `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`
- `p_total` is equal to `(2^n)^k % 1000003`
- `p_shared` is equal to `(p_total - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003`
- `A` is equal to `p_shared`
- `B` is equal to `p_total`

The code `g = func_1(A, B)` assigns the result of `func_1(A, B)` to `g`. The values of `A` and `B` are determined by the calculations already performed in the initial state. 

Since we are not provided with the specifics of the function `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `g`. However, we can state that `g` is assigned a value based on the current values of `A` and `B`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, `numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i) % 1000003` for `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `denominator` is equal to `(2^n)^k % 1000003`, `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`, `p_total` is equal to `(2^n)^k % 1000003`, `p_shared` is equal to `(p_total - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003`, `A` is equal to `p_shared`, `B` is equal to `p_total`, and `g` is the result of `func_1(A, B)` which cannot be specified without further information about `func_1`.**
