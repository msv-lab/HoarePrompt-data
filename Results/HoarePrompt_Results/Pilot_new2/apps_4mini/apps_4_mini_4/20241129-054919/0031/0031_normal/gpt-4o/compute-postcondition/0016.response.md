The code updates the `denominator` by multiplying it with `total_days` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \), and `denominator` is updated accordingly.

Thus, the new value of `denominator` can be expressed as:
\[
\text{denominator} = \text{denominator} * (2^n) \% 1000003
\]

The variables `n`, `k`, `MOD`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `i` are not changed by the code execution, except for `denominator`, which is updated.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \); `numerator` is equal to \( numerator * (2^n - 2) \% 1000003 \); `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`; `i` is 2**.
