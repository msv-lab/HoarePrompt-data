The code calculates `p_shared` using the formula `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The variables that will be updated as a result of this code are `p_shared`.

1. `p_total` is equal to `(2^n)^k % 1000003`.
2. `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`.
3. The value of `MOD` is 1000003.

Now, substituting the values:
- `p_shared` will be calculated as:
  - `p_shared = ((2^n)^k % 1000003 - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, `numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i) % 1000003` for `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `denominator` is equal to `(2^n)^k % 1000003`, `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`, `p_total` is equal to `(2^n)^k % 1000003`, `p_shared` is equal to `(p_total - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003`.**
