The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `denominator`. The previous value of `denominator` was not specified, so we can state that `denominator` is now `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `k` is less than or equal to 1 shifted left by `n`, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
