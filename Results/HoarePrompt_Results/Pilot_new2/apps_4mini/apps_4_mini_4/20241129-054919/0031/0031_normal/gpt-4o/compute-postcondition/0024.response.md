The variable `A` is assigned the value `A // g`, where `g` is the result of `func_1(A, B)`. The previous values of the affected variables are `A` (which is equal to `p_shared`), `B` (which is equal to `p_total`), and `g` is unknown as it is dependent on `func_1`. Therefore, we can represent the updated state of `A`, but cannot specify its exact value without knowing `g`.

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, `numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i) % 1000003` for `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `denominator` is equal to `(2^n)^k % 1000003`, `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`, `p_total` is equal to `(2^n)^k % 1000003`, `p_shared` is equal to `(p_total - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003`, `A` is equal to `p_shared // g`, `B` is equal to `p_total`, and `g` is the result of `func_1(A, B)`.**
