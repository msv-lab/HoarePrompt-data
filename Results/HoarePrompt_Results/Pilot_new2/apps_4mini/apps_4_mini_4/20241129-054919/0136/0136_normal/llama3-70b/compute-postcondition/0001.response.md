The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input, with any leading zeros stripped away using `lstrip('0')`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as the input does not affect it. Since `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, after stripping leading zeros, it may become an empty string if the original input was '0' or it will be a valid string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros for any other input. Therefore, the Output State reflects this change.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros after stripping any leading zeros from the input.**
