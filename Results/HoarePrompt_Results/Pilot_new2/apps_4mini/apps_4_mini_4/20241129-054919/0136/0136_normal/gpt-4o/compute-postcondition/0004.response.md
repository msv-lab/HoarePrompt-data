The variable `a` is assigned the string value `'0'`. The previous value of `a` was 0, which is represented as an integer. The other variables, `b` and `data`, remain unaffected as they are not modified in this code snippet. 

The output state would reflect that `a` is now a string representing the integer 0.

Output State: **`a` is the string '0', `b` is `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**.
