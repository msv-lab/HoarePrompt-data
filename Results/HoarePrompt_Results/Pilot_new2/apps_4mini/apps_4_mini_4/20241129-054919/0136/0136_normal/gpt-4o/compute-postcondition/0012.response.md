Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros. If `a` is '0', then `b` is set to '0' and `data` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. If `a` is not '0', `b` and `data` remain unchanged. The length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, which means that the current value of `a` has more digits than the value of `b`.***
