Postcondition: ***`a` is the non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros. If `a` is '0', then `b` is `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. Currently, `b` is empty (not b). If `a` is not '0', the function does not alter `b` or `data`.***
