In the provided code snippet, `a` and `b` are being reassigned. The new value of `a` becomes the previous value of `b`, and the new value of `b` becomes the remainder of dividing the old value of `a` by the old value of `b`. 

Since `a` is no longer a multiple of its old value of `b`, the value of `a % b` will be non-zero. The other condition is that `b` must be greater than 0, ensuring that the division by `b` is valid.

Now, let's denote the old values as `old_a` for `a` and `old_b` for `b`. Therefore:
- `a` becomes `old_b`
- `b` becomes `old_a % old_b`

The output state must reflect these new assignments while maintaining the initial conditions where they remain valid.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `old_b`, `b` is equal to `old_a % old_b`, `b` must be greater than 0, and `a` is no longer a multiple of its old value of `b`.**
