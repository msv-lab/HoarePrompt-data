Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem entails generating a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers that sum to n and have the maximal greatest common divisor (GCD). However, the function `func_1` is solely focused on calculating the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm and does not generate a sequence or address the constraints outlined in the problem statement.

Here are the key reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Lack of Sequence Generation**: The function does not create or return any sequence of integers. Instead, it only computes the GCD of the inputs, which is irrelevant to the task of producing a strictly increasing sequence that sums to n.

2. **No Handling of Input Constraints**: The program does not check if a valid sequence can be formed based on the conditions given (for example, whether k positive integers can sum to n). Specifically, if k is greater than n, it is impossible to create such a sequence, but this condition is not checked in the program.

3. **Output Specification**: The problem requires outputting -1 when no valid sequence exists, yet the program does not provide any mechanism for this output since it only returns the GCD.

Overall, the program does not comply with the requirements specified in the problem description, as it fails to generate the necessary sequence of integers and does not account for the constraints that would determine the feasibility of such a sequence.
