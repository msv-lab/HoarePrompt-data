The variable `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. The conditions regarding `n`, `k`, `remainder`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `sequence[i]` by 1 while retaining the prior conditions.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `remainder` equals 0, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
