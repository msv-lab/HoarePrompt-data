The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10 and 1 ≤ `k + 1` ≤ 10^10; `remainder` equals -1, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
