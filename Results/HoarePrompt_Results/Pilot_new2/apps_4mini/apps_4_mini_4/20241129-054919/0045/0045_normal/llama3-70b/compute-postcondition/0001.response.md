The values of `a` and `b` are swapped. The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, and the new value of `b` becomes `a % b`. Since `a` is a positive integer representing the sum `n` and `b` is a positive integer representing the count `k`, the new value of `b` will be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect these changes. 

Output State: **`a` is the old value of `b`, `b` is `a % b` where `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a positive integer.**
