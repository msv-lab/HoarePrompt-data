Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The function implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD, which continues until `b` becomes 0. Therefore, it effectively handles cases where either or both inputs are large positive integers, but it does not account for negative or zero values for `a` or `b`, which may lead to incorrect behavior if input validation is needed. **
