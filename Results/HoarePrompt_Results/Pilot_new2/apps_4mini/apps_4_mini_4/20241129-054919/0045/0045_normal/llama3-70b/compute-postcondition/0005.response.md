The code snippet performs a simultaneous assignment where `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. 

Initially, `a` is equal to `old_b` and `b` is equal to `old_a % old_b`. Since `b` must be greater than 0 and `a` is no longer a multiple of its old value of `b`, we can calculate the new values:
- The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which remains `old_a % old_b`.
- The new value of `b` becomes `old_b % (old_a % old_b)`.

Since `a` is no longer a multiple of its old value of `b`, we maintain that condition.

The output state thus updates the values of `a` and `b` based on the new assignments, while preserving the relevant conditions.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `old_a % old_b`, `b` is equal to `old_b % (old_a % old_b)`, `b` must be greater than 0, and `a` is no longer a multiple of its old value of `b`.**
