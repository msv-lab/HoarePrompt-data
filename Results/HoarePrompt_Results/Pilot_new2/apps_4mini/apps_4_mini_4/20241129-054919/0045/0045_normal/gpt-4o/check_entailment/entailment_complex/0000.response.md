To determine the correctness of the annotated Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze how the program operates in line with the requirements listed.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, we need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that:
   - The sum of the sequence equals `n`.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximal.
2. If such a sequence is not possible, the output should be `-1`.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the smallest sum of the first `k` positive integers. This is correct because the smallest strictly increasing sequence of `k` integers starts from `1` to `k`.

2. **Return -1 if Not Possible**:
   - The program checks if `min_sum > n`. If true, it correctly returns `-1`, indicating it is not possible to form such a sequence.

3. **Division and Remainder**:
   - The program calculates `d = n // min_sum`, which represents the base value for the sequence.
   - It calculates `remainder = n - d * min_sum`, which will be used to adjust the last few elements of the sequence.

4. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The sequence is constructed using a list comprehension: `sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`. This generates a sequence based on `d`, ensuring the numbers are the first `k` multiples of `d`.
   - The program then runs a loop to distribute the remainder among the last `k` integers, incrementing them until the remainder is exhausted.

5. **Return the Sequence**:
   - Finally, the program returns the generated sequence.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- **Strictly Increasing Requirement**: The generated sequence is strictly increasing because it starts from `d` and increments each subsequent element by a constant amount, ensuring all numbers are distinct and arranged in increasing order.
  
- **Sum Equals n**: The series is designed such that the sum of `sequence` equals `n`. The logic of distributing the `remainder` ensures that the total sum adjusts to equal `n`.

- **Maximal GCD**: By multiplying each element by `d`, the GCD of the resulting sequence is `d`, which is maximized based on how `n` and `k` are related.

- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly identifies when it's impossible to create such a sequence (returning `-1`), satisfying the requirement of the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description, handling all specified cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
