The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input, which are integers. The initial state indicates that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, meaning `y` must be at least 3 and less than `x`, which must be at most 100,000. The values of `x` and `y` can change based on the input provided but will still adhere to the initial constraints. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000; x and y are integers assigned from input values**.
