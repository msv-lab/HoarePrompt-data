Postcondition: ***`shares` is the total number of shares obtained using the original value of `r`. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is updated to the previous value of `r` plus the value of `shares * b[0]` and the current value of `shares` becomes 0. Otherwise, `shares` remains less than or equal to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while retaining the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, and `i`.***
