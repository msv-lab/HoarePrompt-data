Output State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is updated to the original value of `r` plus the total contribution from up to the first `m` elements of list `b` (if `shares` was greater than 0 in each iteration), `n` and `m` remain integers between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `shares` was initially 0, then `r` remains unchanged and the loop does not execute.**
