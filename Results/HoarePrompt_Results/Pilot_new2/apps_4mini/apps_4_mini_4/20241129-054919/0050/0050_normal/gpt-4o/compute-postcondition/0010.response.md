To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the variables given the initial conditions.

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30).
   - `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30).
   - `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000).
   - `s` is a list of `n` integers representing the prices of shares as entered by the user.
   - `b` is a list of `m` integers created from user input.
   - `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`.
   - `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of the list `b`.
   - `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`.
   - `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line of code `total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles` computes a new value for `total_bourles`.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - `total_bourles` is now determined by multiplying `max_shares` (which is `r // min_buy_price`) with `max_sell_price` (maximum value in list `b`) and then adding `remaining_bourles` (which is `r % min_buy_price`).

4. **Updating Output State**:
   - The variables that change are `total_bourles`, `max_shares`, and `remaining_bourles`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Putting this all together, the output state should reflect these changes:

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` integers representing the prices of shares as entered by the user, `b` is a list of `m` integers created from user input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of the list `b`, `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is equal to `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.**
