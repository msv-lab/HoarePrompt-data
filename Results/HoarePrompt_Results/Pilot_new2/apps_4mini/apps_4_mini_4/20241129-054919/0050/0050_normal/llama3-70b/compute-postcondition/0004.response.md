The list `b` is sorted in reverse order, meaning its elements will now be arranged from largest to smallest. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order, and `b` is now a list of integers sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
