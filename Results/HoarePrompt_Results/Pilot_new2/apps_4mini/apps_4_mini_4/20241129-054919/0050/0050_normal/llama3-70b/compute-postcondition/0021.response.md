The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 0 and `s[1] - 1`, `shares` remains unchanged, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
