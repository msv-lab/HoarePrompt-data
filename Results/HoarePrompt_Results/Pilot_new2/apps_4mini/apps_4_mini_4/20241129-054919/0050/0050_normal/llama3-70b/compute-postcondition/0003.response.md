The `s` list is sorted in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `s` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is between 1 and 30. The specific values of `s` are not given, but after sorting, `s` will be organized in non-decreasing order. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input split into integers.**
