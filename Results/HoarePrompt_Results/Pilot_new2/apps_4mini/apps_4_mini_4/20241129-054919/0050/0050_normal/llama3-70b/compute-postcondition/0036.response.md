According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `m` is greater than `i + 1`. This means `i` is now equal to its previous value plus 1. 

To determine the next state:
- Since `i` was incremented by 1, we need to set `i` to its new value for the next iteration.
- For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than the updated value of `i`, which is now `previous i + 1`.

Thus, if `i` was the previous value, we derive that for the loop to execute once more, `m` must be greater than `previous i + 2`.

State: **`shares` is the total number of shares obtained using the original value of `r`, `i` is the previous value incremented by 1, and `m` is greater than `previous i + 2`**
