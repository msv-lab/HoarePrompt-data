Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 0 and `s[1] - 1` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[1])` while `i` is 1. Otherwise, `shares` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 1, with a break occurring from the most internal loop or if statement.***
