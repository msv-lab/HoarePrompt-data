After executing the code snippet, the variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is already defined as `4 + (n + 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `n + 4`. Therefore, `index + 1` becomes `n + 5`. The value of `x` is now determined as `int(data[n + 5])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `index` is equal to `4 + (n + 1) - 1`, `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 5])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`**
