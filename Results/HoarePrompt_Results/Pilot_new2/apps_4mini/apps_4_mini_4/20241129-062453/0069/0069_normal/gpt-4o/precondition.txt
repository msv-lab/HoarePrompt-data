T is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5) representing the length of string s, x is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9) representing the desired balance, and s is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
