According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 results, the loop can execute again for the second result. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 1 result, `result` is the first element in the list, and `index` is equal to 1 + 3 * T. For the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` list must have at least 2 results, and `result` must be the second element in the list. 

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `index` is equal to 1 + 3 * T, `results` is a list containing at least 2 results, `result` is the second element in `results`**
