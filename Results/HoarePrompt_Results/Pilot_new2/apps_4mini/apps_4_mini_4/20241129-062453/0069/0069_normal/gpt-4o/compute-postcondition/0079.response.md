The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is equal to `n + 7`, so the new value of `index` becomes `n + 10`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `n + 10`, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 7])`, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 8])`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative balance up to index `i` based on the string `s`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`.**
