#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), and for each test case, n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), x is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and s is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt0, cnt1 = s.count('0'), s.count('1')
        
        balance = cnt0 - cnt1
        
        if balance == x:
            print(n + 1)
        elif (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer for each iteration, `s` is a binary string of length `n` for each iteration, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1` for each iteration, and for each iteration, the printed output is determined by the relationship between `balance`, `x`, and `cnt0 - cnt1`. If at least one iteration occurs where `balance` equals `x`, then `n + 1` is printed. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the printed output is the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` for that iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calculates the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s` (denoted as `balance`). Depending on the relationship between `balance` and `x`, it prints different results: if `balance` equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`; if `balance` does not equal `x` and the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The function assumes that `cnt0 - cnt1` is not zero; if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, it could lead to a division by zero error in certain conditions not handled in the code.
