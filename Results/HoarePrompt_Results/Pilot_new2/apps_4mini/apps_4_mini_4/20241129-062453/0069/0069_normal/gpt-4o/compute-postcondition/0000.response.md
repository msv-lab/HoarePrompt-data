The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` does not modify any of the existing variables (T, n, x, s) but instead reassigns `input` to point to the method `sys.stdin.read`. The other variables remain unchanged and retain their specified ranges.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, and `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.read`.**
