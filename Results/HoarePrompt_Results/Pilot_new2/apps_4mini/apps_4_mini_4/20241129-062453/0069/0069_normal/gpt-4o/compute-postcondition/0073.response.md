The `results` list is updated by appending the value of `count`. The value of `count` is already defined as the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. The other variables remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `index` is equal to `n + 7`, `n` is at least 1, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 5])`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is equal to the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` has been updated to include the new value of `count`.**
