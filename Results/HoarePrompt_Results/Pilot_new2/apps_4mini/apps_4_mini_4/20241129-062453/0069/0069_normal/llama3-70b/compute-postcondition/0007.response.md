The code snippet `print(n + 1)` outputs the value of `n + 1`, but does not modify any variables. The current state of the variables remains unchanged. 

Therefore, since `n` is an input integer, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the expression that would be printed.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the current value of `balance` is equal to `x`, `n + 1` is printed.**
