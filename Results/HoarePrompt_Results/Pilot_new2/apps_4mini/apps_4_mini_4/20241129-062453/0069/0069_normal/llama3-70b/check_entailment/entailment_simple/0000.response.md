To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the requirements of the problem and how the program attempts to fulfill them.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Structure**: The program receives multiple test cases (up to 100). For each test case, it receives:
   - Two integers: `n` (length of the binary string) and `x` (desired balance).
   - A binary string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The balance of the string `s` is defined as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's:
   \[
   \text{balance} = \text{cnt0} - \text{cnt1}
   \]
   where `cnt0` is the count of '0's and `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`.

3. **Output Requirements**: For each test case, the output is:
   - `n + 1` if the balance of the string `s` equals `x`.
   - `-1` if there are infinitely many prefixes with balance `x`.
   - Otherwise, the number of prefixes that achieve the balance `x`.

### Program Logic:
- The program correctly counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the string `s`.
- It then calculates the balance.
- It checks:
  - If the balance equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`.
  - If `balance` does not equal `x` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it determines that there are infinitely many prefixes and prints `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it calculates how many prefixes can achieve the balance `x` using the formula \((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1\).

### Analysis:
1. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - The condition for checking if the balance equals `x` is correct.
   - When checking for infinite prefixes, the condition `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` correctly identifies when the balance can be achieved indefinitely by repeating the string `s`.
   - The formula used for counting the valid prefixes when neither of the previous conditions is met is also appropriately designed based on the problem's requirements.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` (i.e., balance is `0`), and both can be managed properly through the conditions outlined.
   - It also considers the case for achieving balance when `n` is very small (such as `1`), ensuring that the logic holds regardless of the length of `s`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program against the problem description, we can confirm that the program follows the requirements as intended. It correctly computes the balance, evaluates cases for infinite prefixes, and calculates the necessary outputs.

Correctness: **True**
