The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is 1, so `data[index + 1]` is equivalent to `data[2]`. This means `x` becomes the integer value of the string located at the second index of the `data` list. Other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 1, `n` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings derived from the input, `results` is an empty list.**
