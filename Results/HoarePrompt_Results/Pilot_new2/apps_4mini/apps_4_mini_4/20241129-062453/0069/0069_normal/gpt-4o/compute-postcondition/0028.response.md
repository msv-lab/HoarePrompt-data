Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` must have at least 2 elements, `count` is 0. The current value of `x - b` is divisible by `balance`, and the result of `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0.***
