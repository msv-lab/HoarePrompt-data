The code `results.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `results`. This action does not change or affect any other variables in the initial state; it simply adds a new element to the `results` list. 

Since we don't have specific values for other variables like `results`, we will maintain the description of the initial state while noting that `-1` has been added to `results`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `n + 10`, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 7])`, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 8])`, `prefix_balances` is updated such that `prefix_balances[i]` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from `s`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, the current value of `balance` is 0, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, the current value of `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, and `-1` has been appended to `results`.**
