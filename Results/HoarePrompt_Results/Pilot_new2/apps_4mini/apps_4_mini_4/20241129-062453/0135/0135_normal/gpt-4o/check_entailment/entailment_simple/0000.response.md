To determine the correctness of the annotated program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the provided implementation.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to check if all remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct.
- Specifically, we want to verify that for any pair `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`, the condition `n % i ≠ n % j` holds.
- The output should be "Yes" if all remainders are distinct and "No" otherwise.
- Special consideration is given to the case where `k >= n`, in which case the output should be "No" because the remainder when dividing by `n` (i.e., `n % n`) is always `0`, which can cause duplication with `n % 1` (also `0`).

### Program Implementation:
1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if `k >= n` and returns "No" if true. This aligns with the problem requirements.
2. **Remainder Calculation**: The program uses a `for` loop to calculate the remainders for all integers from `1` to `k`.
3. **Set for Unique Remainders**: It maintains a set called `seen_remainders` to track unique remainders.
4. **Checking for Duplicates**: If a remainder already exists in `seen_remainders`, it returns "No", indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
5. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns "Yes".

### Correctness Analysis:
- The check for `k >= n` is correct and ensures that the program handles this edge case appropriately.
- The use of a set to store remainders guarantees that each remainder is checked for uniqueness efficiently.
- The loop that iterates from `1` to `k` correctly computes the remainders using `n % i`.
- As per the specifications, if any two indices produce the same remainder, the program immediately returns "No".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the described requirements and checks for distinct remainders in all cases. Therefore, it adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
