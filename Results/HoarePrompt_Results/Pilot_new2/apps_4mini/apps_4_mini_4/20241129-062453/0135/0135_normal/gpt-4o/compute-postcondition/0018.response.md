Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and k ≥ 3, `seen_remainders` includes 0, and `i` is 3. If `remainder` (which is `n % 3`) is in `seen_remainders`, the program returns 'No'. If `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`, there are no changes or returns specified in the else part.***
