The `seen` variable is initialized as an empty set. The previous values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to the first input value, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, and `seen` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input value, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `seen` is an empty set.**
