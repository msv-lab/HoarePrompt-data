The code `exit()` is executed, which terminates the program immediately. No variables are changed, but the execution stops. Thus, the preconditions remain valid without any modifications to the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `seen` is a set containing 0, `remainder` is equal to `n % 2, and the output is 'No'.**
