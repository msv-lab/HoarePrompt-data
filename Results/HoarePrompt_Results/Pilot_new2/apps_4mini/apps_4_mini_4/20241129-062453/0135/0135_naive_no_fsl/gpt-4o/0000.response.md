To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the program and check for potential cases that it might not handle correctly.

### Problem Understanding

The problem requires us to check if the remainders of division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that:
1. `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`
2. `n % i = n % j`

### Program Analysis

1. The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If so, it directly returns "No". This is because if `k >= n`, then `n % n` (which is 0) would be equal to `n % (any integer < n)` that could also give a remainder of 0, hence not ensuring distinctness.
3. If `k < n`, it initializes a set `seen_remainders` to track distinct remainders.
4. It iterates through each integer from `1` to `k`, calculates `n % i`, and checks if this remainder has already been seen.
5. If a duplicate remainder is found, it returns "No". If all remainders are distinct, it returns "Yes".

### Potential Cases Not Handled

1. The program does not consider the case when `k = 1`. In this case, the only remainder calculated would be `n % 1`, which is always `0`. Therefore, if `k = 1`, it should return "No" since there's no `j` to compare against (but logically, we can think of it as a duplicate).
  
2. Additionally, edge cases where `n` is very small and `k` is also small (e.g., `n = 1, k = 1`) are not explicitly handled. The expected output in this case should be "No" due to the reasons mentioned above.

### Conclusion

The program fails to handle the case when `k = 1` correctly, as it would incorrectly imply that it could return "Yes" when the distinct remainders condition fails.

Thus, based on this analysis and the identified case, the program does not meet the requirements as described.

Correctness: **False**
