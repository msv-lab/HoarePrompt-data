Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and now includes `a[2]`, `i` is 3, `can_form` is False, `assigned` must not be empty. The current value of `i` is 3, and the expression `(a[i] - x)` is found in `assigned`.***
