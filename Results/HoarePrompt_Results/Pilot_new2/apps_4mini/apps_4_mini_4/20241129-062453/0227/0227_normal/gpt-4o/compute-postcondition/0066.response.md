The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where each integer `a[k]` (1 ≤ k ≤ n) satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, the program returns the count of distinct integers that could not be formed by pairs in the list `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers, and return the count of distinct integers that cannot be formed by pairs in the list `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers, returns the count of distinct integers that could not be formed by pairs in the list a.**
