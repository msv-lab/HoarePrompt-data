The code checks the value of `m` and prints either `m` or `-1`. If `m` is less than or equal to 23, it will print `m`, otherwise, it will print `-1`. The variable `m` retains its value after the check, and the other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`m` is the count of distinct integers in `a` such that no element is double the previous one, `n` is the total number of elements in `a`, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers. The output printed is `m` if `m` <= 23 or -1 if `m` > 23.**
