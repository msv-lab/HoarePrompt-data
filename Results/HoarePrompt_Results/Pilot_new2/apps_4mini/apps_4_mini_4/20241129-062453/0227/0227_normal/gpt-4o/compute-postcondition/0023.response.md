The `assigned` set has an element added, which is `a[i]`. The initial state indicates that `assigned` already contains at least one element from `a`, and `i` is still equal to 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `can_form` do not change as a result of this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` now includes `a[1]`, `i` remains 1, and if `can_form` is False, then `m` is set to 2.**
