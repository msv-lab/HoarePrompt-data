The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The output state will reflect that `can_form` is now `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the third value in `assigned`, `can_form` is True**.
