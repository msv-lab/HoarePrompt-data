Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and `a[2]`, and `assigned` is not empty. The value of `can_form` is False, indicating that there does not exist any `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`.***
