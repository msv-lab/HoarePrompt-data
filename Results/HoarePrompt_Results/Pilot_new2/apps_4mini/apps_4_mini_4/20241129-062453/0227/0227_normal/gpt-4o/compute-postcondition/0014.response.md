Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second value in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the inner loop or if statement is exited.***
