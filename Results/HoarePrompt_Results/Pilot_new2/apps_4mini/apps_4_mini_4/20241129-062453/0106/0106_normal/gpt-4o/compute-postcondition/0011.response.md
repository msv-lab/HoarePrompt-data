To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we need to analyze what values are involved and how they interact based on the initial state.

- Given:
  - `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000.
  - `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k`.
  - `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(a)`.
  - `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(b)`.
  - If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is equal to `9 + floor_a`.
  - `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
  - `reverse_walk_time` is equal to `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
  - `min_walk_time` is equal to `min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)`.
  - `time_to_target_floor` is equal to `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

After executing:
```
total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
```

We need to summarize the variables that have changed based on the calculations defined in the code:

1. `time_to_exit` will be evaluated based on the value of `floor_a`.
2. `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` will be calculated based on the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`.
3. `min_walk_time` will be derived from the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
4. `time_to_target_floor` will be determined from `floor_b`.
5. `total_time` will be the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.

Since the specific values of `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`, and the outputs of `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)` are not provided, we will keep the expressions in the output state rather than concrete values.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k; block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` are assigned values from `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)`; `time_to_exit` is either 0 or `9 + floor_a`, `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is equal to `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`; `min_walk_time` is equal to `min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)`; `time_to_target_floor` is equal to `(floor_b - 1) * 5`; `total_time` is equal to `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`.**
