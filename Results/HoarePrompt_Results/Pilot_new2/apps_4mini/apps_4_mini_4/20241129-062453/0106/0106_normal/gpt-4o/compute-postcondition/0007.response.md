The variable `direct_walk_time` is assigned the value of `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`. The values of `block_a` and `block_b` are used to compute the absolute difference, which is then taken modulo `n`, and finally multiplied by 15. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is equal to `9 + floor_a`; `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.**
