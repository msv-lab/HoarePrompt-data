Functionality: ** The function accepts two pairs of integers `n`, `m`, `k` and `a`, `b` from user input. It calculates the minimum time required to travel between two points represented by `a` and `b` in a grid-like system defined by `n` blocks each containing `m` floors and `k` segments. The function returns the sum of the minimum block travel time and the minimum floor travel time, accounted for different scenarios of block positions and floor levels. It does not handle any edge cases related to invalid inputs or scenarios where `a` is equal to `b`, but it is defined that `a` and `b` will always be distinct based on the preconditions.**
