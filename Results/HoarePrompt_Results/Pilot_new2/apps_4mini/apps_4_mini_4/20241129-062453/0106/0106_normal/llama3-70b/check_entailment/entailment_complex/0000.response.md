To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program accurately calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment, considering the unique constraints and rules specified in the problem.

### Breakdown of the Code Logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. This is correctly done.

2. **Floor and Block Calculation:**
   - The program computes the floor and block (or entrance) numbers for both apartments:
     - `a_floor` and `b_floor` are calculated using modulo and addition, which correctly determines the floor number.
     - `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated using integer division to determine the block number that the apartments belong to.

3. **Block Travel Time Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the minimum time to travel between blocks (entrances):
     - It correctly accounts for the circular nature of the building (when moving from one block to another) using `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.

4. **Floor Travel Time Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the time needed to travel between floors:
     - It adds 10 seconds to either the upward or downward movement which is relevant to the elevator's travel time. However, there's a flaw here; it does not correctly represent the case when floors are the same (where the elevator would not be needed and should account for instant movement).

5. **Final Time Calculation:**
   - The program sums the travel times from blocks and floors and prints the result.
   
### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Floor Travel Time Calculation:**
   - The condition for calculating floor time does not account for cases where `a_floor` equals `b_floor`. If they are the same, the time should be 0 seconds rather than 10 seconds. The logic assumes an elevator call and movement is necessary even when Edward is already on the same floor as Natasha.

2. **No Edge Case Handling:**
   - While the prompt guarantees `a` and `b` will always be distinct, there is no consideration for cases where either Edward or Natasha might be on the same floor, making the travel time for floors inaccurate.

### Conclusion:

Although the program correctly calculates the block travel time and has a good base for floor travel time, it fails to accurately compute the scenario when Edward and Natasha are on the same floor and incorrectly assumes the need for elevator travel in such cases.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
