The value of `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The previous values of the affected variables, specifically `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, remain unchanged, but `floor_within_block` is now specifically defined. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k`; `block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.**
