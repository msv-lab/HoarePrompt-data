Let's analyze the provided Python code and its description to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description:
The problem involves calculating the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment from his own, considering the structure of a circular building with multiple blocks, floors, and apartments. The time calculations involve taking the stairs and using an elevator, with specified time costs for each action.

### Functions Overview:
1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**
   - This function computes the block and floor number for a given apartment number.
   - It calculates the block by using integer division and the floor using the remainder.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**
   - This function calculates the total time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
   - It determines the time for Edward to exit his floor, the walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor.

### Output Description:
The output hints for each function indicate that:
- `get_location` should return valid block and floor indices based on the apartment number.
- `func_1` should return the total time required to go from apartment `a` to apartment `b`, factoring in all time costs as described in the problem.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Correctness of `get_location`:**
   - The calculation of blocks and floors seems logical based on the description. However, the function does not handle cases where the apartment number is invalid (out of range), which could lead to incorrect indices.
   
2. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function appears to compute time correctly based on the inputs provided. However, it relies on the output of `get_location`, which may not be valid if `a` or `b` is out of range.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Invalid Apartment Number:**
   - If `a` or `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n * m * k`, `get_location` will return invalid indices, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in `func_1`.
  
2. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - If `a` and `b` are located within the same block and floor, the program should handle this efficiently but does not have specific checks for such cases, which may lead to unnecessary computations.

### Evaluation of Output Hints:
The hints indicate that the functions should follow the specifications correctly and are aligned with their logic. However, since `get_location` does not handle invalid inputs, the overall program could yield incorrect results without warning.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential for incorrect results when apartment numbers are out of bounds, the program does not fulfill the requirement of handling **every potential case** from the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.

**Reason:** An invalid apartment number (outside the valid range) could lead to incorrect calculations because `get_location` does not handle cases where the apartment numbers fall outside the specified limits.
