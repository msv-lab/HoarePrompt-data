        time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is equal to `9 + floor_a`.
    direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15
    reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
    min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)
    time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5
    total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
    return total_time
    #The program returns the total time which is calculated as the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor, where time_to_exit is either 0 or 9 + floor_a, min_walk_time is the minimum of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor is equal to (floor_b - 1) * 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, alongside two distinct integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the total time required to move from the location represented by `a` to the location represented by `b`, considering the exit time from the floor of `a`, the walking time between the blocks, and the time to reach the target floor associated with `b`. The function returns the computed total time based on these calculations.

def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #The program returns block and floor, where block is calculated based on the apartment number, and floor is calculated based on the floor_within_block.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `apartment` and returns a tuple containing the `block` and `floor` corresponding to the given apartment number. The `block` is determined by the integer division of `apartment - 1` by the product of `m` and `k`, while the `floor` is calculated based on the remainder of the division of `apartment - 1` by `m * k`, further divided by `k`. The function does not handle cases where `apartment` falls outside the valid range defined by `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k`, which could lead to unexpected results if those conditions are violated.
