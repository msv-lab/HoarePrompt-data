In the provided code snippet, the variables `a` and `b` are assigned new integer values based on user input. The function `map(int, input().split())` will take a line of input, split it into separate strings, and then convert those strings into integers, assigning them to `a` and `b`. 

Since `a` and `b` must now hold specific values between 1 and `n·m·k`, and they cannot be equal to each other, they are updated accordingly. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned new integer values based on input; `a` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `b` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `a` ≠ `b`.**
