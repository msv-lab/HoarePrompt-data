Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `r_queue` must contain at least 2 elements and `d_queue` has a new element which is `d_index + n`; if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `d_queue` is not empty and `r_queue` now contains the new value `r_index + n`, while `r_queue` has one less element.***
