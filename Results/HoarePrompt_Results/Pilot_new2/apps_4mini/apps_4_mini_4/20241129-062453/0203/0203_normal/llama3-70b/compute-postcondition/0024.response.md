The function `func` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'D' and 'R'. The integer `n` represents the number of employees, while the string indicates the fractions of employees, with 'D' and 'R' denoting different categories. After executing the function body, it processes the input and returns a result based on the characters in the string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and processes this input to generate a result based on the distribution of 'D' and 'R' characters in the string.**
