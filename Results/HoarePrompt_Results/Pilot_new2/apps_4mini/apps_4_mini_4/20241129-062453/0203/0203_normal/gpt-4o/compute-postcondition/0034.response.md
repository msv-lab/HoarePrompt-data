The variable `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `d_queue`, which is removed from `d_queue` as a result of the `pop(0)` operation. The original conditions state that `d_queue` must not be empty for this operation to be valid. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue` and removed from it; `r_index` is less than or greater than or equal to `d_index`, accordingly.**
