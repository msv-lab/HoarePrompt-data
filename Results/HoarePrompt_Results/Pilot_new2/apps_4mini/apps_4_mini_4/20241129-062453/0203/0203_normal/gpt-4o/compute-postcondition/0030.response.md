The code `d_queue.append(d_index + n)` appends the value of `d_index + n` to the `d_queue`. The value of `d_index` is the first element of the `d_queue`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. Therefore, the new value appended to `d_queue` will depend on the current value of `d_index`.

Assuming `d_queue` was not empty before the execution of the code (since `d_index` is defined as the value of the first element of `d_queue`), the output state can be updated to reflect the new state of `d_queue`. The other variables remain unchanged, since the code only affects `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `r_queue` must contain at least 2 elements; if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `d_queue` is not empty; `d_index` is the value of the first element of `d_queue`; `r_index` is the value of the previous first element of `r_queue`; `r_queue` has one less element; `d_queue` has a new element which is `d_index + n`.**
