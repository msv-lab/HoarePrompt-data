The `r_queue` list is modified by appending the value of `r_index + n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, and `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue` before it was popped, but its exact value is not provided. Therefore, the updated state reflects the addition of the new value to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue` and removed from it; `r_index` is now equal to the first element that was in `r_queue` before it was popped; `r_queue` now includes the value `r_index + n` appended.**
