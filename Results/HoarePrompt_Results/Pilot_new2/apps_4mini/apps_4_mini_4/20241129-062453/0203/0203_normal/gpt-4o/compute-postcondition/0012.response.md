`r_queue` now includes the value of `i`, which is equal to `n`. The variable `i` retains its value of `n`, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `n`; `v` is the next character in the votes string at index `n`; `d_queue` is the corresponding state based on `v`; `r_queue` includes the value `n`.**
