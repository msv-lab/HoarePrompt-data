Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` includes at least `i + 1` elements, with `i + 1` appended to it. Otherwise, `r_queue` includes `i` after appending, and `votes` must include at least `i + 1` elements.***
