To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze it step by step:

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle with side length `x` into one with side length `y`, ensuring that at each moment, the triangle is non-degenerate (meaning that the sides still form a valid triangle).

### Program Code:
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
print(abs(x - y))
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program reads two integers `x` and `y`, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`.
2. It calculates and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`.

### Analysis of the Problem:
- The problem states that in one second, Memory can modify one side of the triangle, but it doesn't simply mean changing the length directly to `y`. 
- Each modification must maintain the integrity of the triangle. For example, reducing one side to `y` directly would not be valid unless the other two sides are also adjusted accordingly, ensuring they still form a triangle.
- The actual process might involve multiple steps to gradually reduce the side lengths without breaking the triangle's properties.

### Key Edge Cases:
1. If `x` is significantly larger than `y`, you need to ensure that each step maintains a valid triangle. The code doesn't consider the triangle properties and just computes the difference, which could be misleading.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The output hints mention that it calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. This implies that the program is suggesting that the minimum number of seconds is simply the difference in lengths, which is not necessarily true due to the triangle requirement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not adhere to the problem description comprehensively. The calculation of `abs(x - y)` oversimplifies the problem because it disregards the triangle's properties and the necessary conditions for each modification.

**Correctness: False**

### Reason:
The program does not consider the need for each modification to maintain a valid triangle, which means it cannot correctly compute the minimum number of seconds required for the transformation between side lengths `x` and `y`. For example, in the case of `x = 22` and `y = 4`, the actual transformation process requires multiple steps that the code does not accommodate.
