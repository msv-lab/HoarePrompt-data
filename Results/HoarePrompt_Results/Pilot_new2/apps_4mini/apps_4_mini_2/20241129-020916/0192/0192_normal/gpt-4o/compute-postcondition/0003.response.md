The function `func` reads two integers `x` and `y` from input, ensuring that they adhere to the constraints \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). It then calculates and prints the result of the expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\). This expression effectively computes the ceiling of the half difference between `x` and `y`. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the standard output. There is no handling for cases where the input might not meet the specified constraints, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` (where \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\)) and prints the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. It does not return a value and does not handle input errors or constraints directly. **
