The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the number of moves required to reach from `y` to `x`, considering both even and odd differences. Given that the initial constraints are `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the range of values for `x` and `y` ensures that `x - y` is always a positive integer.

1. The value of `(x - y)` is a positive integer.
2. Since `x` is an input integer and `y` is also an input integer, their specific values are not given, but the relationship is maintained.
3. The result of the expression is assigned for printing, but during this printing, the values of `x` and `y` do not change.

The output state reflects the relationship between `y` and `x`, and the result of the expression:

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, result of the expression is `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`**
