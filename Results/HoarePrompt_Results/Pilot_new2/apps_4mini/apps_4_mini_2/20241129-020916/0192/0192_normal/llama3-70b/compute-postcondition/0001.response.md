The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, but the output will be the absolute value of `x - y`. Given that `y` is an integer such that `3 ≤ y < x`, the result of `abs(x - y)` will be a positive integer.

Output State: **`x` is input integer, `y` is input integer such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and the output is abs(`x - y`).**
