The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. After executing the function body, the specific output is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, based on the parameters alone, we can infer that the function likely performs some computations or checks based on the values of `x` and `y`. However, without further information about the conditions and return values, we cannot specify the functionality clearly.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, where both are integers within the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific return value is not stated.**
