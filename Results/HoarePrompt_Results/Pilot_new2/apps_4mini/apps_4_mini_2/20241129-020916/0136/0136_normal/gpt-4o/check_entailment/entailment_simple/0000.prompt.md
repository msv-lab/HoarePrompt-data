You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".


-----Examples-----

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are two non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, and each can have up to 10^6 digits.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, and if `a` is '0', then `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after leading zeroes are stripped from `data[1]`, while `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace.
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and the current value of `b` is '0'.
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and the current value of `b` is '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, if `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is confirmed to be greater than `b`. Otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the output printed is '='.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and the current value of `b` is '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, then `a` is confirmed to be less than `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is confirmed to be greater than `b`. Otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the output printed is '='.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and the current value of `b` is '0'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the printed output is '>'. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, then if `a` is less than `b`, it is confirmed that `a` is less than `b`; if `a` is greater than `b`, it is confirmed that `a` is greater than `b`; otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the printed output is '='.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and the current value of `b` is '0'. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, then if `a` is less than `b`, the output is confirmed as '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is confirmed as '>'; otherwise, the output is '='.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
