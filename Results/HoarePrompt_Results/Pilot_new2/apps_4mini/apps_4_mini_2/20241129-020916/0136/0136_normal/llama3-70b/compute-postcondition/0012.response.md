Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers represented as strings, reads them from input, and compares their values after stripping leading zeros. It prints '=' if the numbers are equal, '<' if the first number is less than the second, and '>' if the first number is greater than the second. If both inputs are empty or contain only zeros, they will be treated as equal. The function does not handle cases where both inputs are empty strings resulting in an output of '='. **
