The code snippet executes a print statement which outputs the string '='. The execution does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged conditions and the print output.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and the current value of `b` is '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Print output: '='**
