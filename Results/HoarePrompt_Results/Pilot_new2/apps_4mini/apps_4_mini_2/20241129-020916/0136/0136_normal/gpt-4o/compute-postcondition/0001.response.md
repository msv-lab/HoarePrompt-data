The variable `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after stripping any leading zeroes. The initial state indicates that `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, which can have leading zeros. Therefore, after execution, `a` will be updated to a string representation of `data[0]` without any leading zeroes. The value of `b` remains unchanged, and `data` still contains the original list of strings.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace.**
