The code contains a print statement that outputs the string '='. The variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation, and their values remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, both equal to each other; '=' is printed to the output.**
