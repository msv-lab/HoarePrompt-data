The variable `a` is assigned the value `'0'`, which replaces its previous value of an empty string. The variables `b` and `data` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is '0'; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after leading zeroes are stripped from `data[1]`; `data` is a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace.**
