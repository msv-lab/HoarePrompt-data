The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading zeroes from it. The initial state mentions that `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeroes. After the execution of this code, `b` will still represent a non-negative integer but without any leading zeroes. The variable `a` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes**
