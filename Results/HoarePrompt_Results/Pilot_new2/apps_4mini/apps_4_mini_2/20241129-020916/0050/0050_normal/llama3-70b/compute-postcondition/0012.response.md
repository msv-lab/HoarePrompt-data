Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`, `shares` is a positive integer that is at least equal to its previous value plus `r // s[i]`, and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `shares` is set to 0, `i` is still 0, and `r` is less than `s[i]`, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
