Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`.***
