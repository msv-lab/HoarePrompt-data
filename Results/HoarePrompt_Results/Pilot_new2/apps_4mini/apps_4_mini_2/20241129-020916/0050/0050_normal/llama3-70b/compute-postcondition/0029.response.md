The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is greater than 0, `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000) that is less than all elements of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
