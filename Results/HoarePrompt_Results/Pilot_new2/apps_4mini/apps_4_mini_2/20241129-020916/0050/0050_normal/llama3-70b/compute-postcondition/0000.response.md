The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values provided as input, where `map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input and splits it into three integer values. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `r` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer based on input (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer based on input (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of n integers where each s[i] (1 <= s[i] <= 1000) represents the price to buy shares, and `b` is a list of m integers where each b[i] (1 <= b[i] <= 1000) represents the price to sell shares.**
