To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the requirements of the problem description.

**Problem Requirements:**
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximal.
3. If it's not possible to create such a sequence, the output should be `-1`.

**Program Logic:**
1. The program first calculates the minimum sum required for `k` distinct positive integers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to create such a sequence.
2. It then calculates `d`, which is the greatest integer that can be multiplied with the sequence `[1, 2, ..., k]` such that the resulting numbers do not exceed `n`.
3. After forming the initial sequence, it distributes any remaining value (`remainder`) among the last few numbers of the sequence to maintain their strictly increasing nature.

**Potential Test Cases:**
1. **Case (n=6, k=3)**: The output would be `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.
2. **Case (n=8, k=2)**: The output would be `[2, 6]`, which is correct.
3. **Case (n=5, k=3)**: The output would be `-1`, which is correct.

Now let's analyze if there are any cases where the program might fail:
- **Case (n=10, k=3)**: 
   - Minimum sum = `1 + 2 + 3 = 6` (which is ≤ 10)
   - `d = 10 // 6 = 1`
   - Sequence will be `[1, 2, 3]`, which sums to `6`. Adding `4` to last elements (due to remainder of `4`), resulting sequence might be `[1, 2, 3] + [1, 1, 1]` = `[2, 3, 4]` (which sums to 9). The next increment will be `[2, 3, 5]` which sums to 10. This is valid and increasing.

- **Case (n=12, k=3)**:
   - Minimum sum = `1 + 2 + 3 = 6` (which is ≤ 12)
   - `d = 12 // 6 = 2`
   - The resulting sequence would start as `[2, 4, 6]`. This is strictly increasing and sums to `12`. This is valid.

However, we need to check if the sequence produced maintains the strict increasing nature when distributing the remainder. 

An important edge case needs to be checked is whether the program handles the distribution correctly:
- **Case (n=7, k=3)**:
   - Minimum sum = `1 + 2 + 3 = 6` (which is ≤ 7)
   - `d = 7 // 6 = 1`
   - The resulting sequence starts as `[1, 2, 3]` (sums to 6). Remainder is `1`.
   - The program adds `1` to the last element. However, this results in `[1, 2, 4]`, which is still valid. 
   
But if we try a case where `n` is less than the minimal sum + 1:
- **Case (n=6, k=4)**: 
   - Minimum sum = `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` (which is > 6) so it correctly returns `-1`.

After careful consideration, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem without any overlooked edge cases. 

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**.
