The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers and checks if this sum exceeds `n`. If it does, the function returns -1. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function calculates how many times this minimum sum can fit into `n`, adjusts for any remainder, and returns a sequence of length `k` where the `i-th` element is incremented appropriately based on the division and remainder calculations. The function ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `n`.
