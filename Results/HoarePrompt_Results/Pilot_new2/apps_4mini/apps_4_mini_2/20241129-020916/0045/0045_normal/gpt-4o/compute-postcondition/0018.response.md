According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `k - 3`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we have:
- The value of `i` becomes `k - 3`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n; d` is equal to `n // min_sum; remainder` is `previous_value - 1; `remainder` has been decremented by 1; `sequence` is equal to `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k - 2)] + [d * k + 1], where `sequence[k - 2]` is updated to `d * (k - 1) + 1`; `i` is `k - 3`**
