Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The task is to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximal. If no such sequence exists, the function should return -1.

2. **Annotated Program**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` computes the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b`. However, it does not construct a sequence that meets the problem's conditions of being strictly increasing, summing to `n`, and having `k` elements.
   - The GCD calculation itself does not help in generating the required sequence or checking whether it can be formed under the given constraints.

3. **Missing Logic**:
   - There is no logic to check if a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers can be formed from `n`.
   - The program does not handle the case where `k` elements cannot sum up to `n`, nor does it return the sequence, which is explicitly required by the problem.

### Counterexample:
In the case provided in the examples:
- For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the program should recognize that it's impossible to create three strictly positive integers that sum to 5 (the minimum sum for 3 positive integers is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6), and thus it should return -1. However, the annotated program does not address this at all.

In conclusion, the program does not meet the specifications of the problem description, leading to the determination that it is incorrect.
