According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from `k - 1` to `0`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least `1`. Given that `k` is stated to be a positive integer (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10), this condition is inherently satisfied.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take on the value of `k - 1` for the first iteration. Therefore, there are no additional adjustments needed for the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n; d` is equal to `n // min_sum; `remainder` is equal to `n - d * min_sum; `sequence` is equal to `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]; `i` is `k - 1`**
