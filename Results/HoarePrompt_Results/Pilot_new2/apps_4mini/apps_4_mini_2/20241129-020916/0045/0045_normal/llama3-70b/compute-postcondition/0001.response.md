The variables `a` and `b` are swapped in a tuple assignment, where `a` takes the current value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is a positive integer and `b` is also a positive integer, the operation `a % b` will yield a non-negative integer that is less than `b`. 

After the execution:
- `a` will have the value of the previous `b`, which is still a positive integer.
- `b` will have the value of `a % b`, which is a non-negative integer and less than the previous value of `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer representing the previous value of `b`, `b` is a non-negative integer less than the previous value of `b` (which is `a % b`).

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer representing the previous value of `b`, `b` is a non-negative integer equal to `a % b` and less than the previous value of `b`.**
