To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10) and `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10). 
2. The variable `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, and it is stated that `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. The variable `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, where `//` represents floor division, which gives the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
4. The code then calculates `remainder` as `n - d * min_sum`.

The important details to keep track of are:
- The value of `min_sum` remains the same.
- The value of `d` is determined by the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`.
- The value of `remainder` is calculated as the difference between `n` and the product of `d` and `min_sum`.

Now let's summarize the new values after execution:
- `remainder` is assigned the value `n - d * min_sum`.

The preconditions that remain valid after executing the code are:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10.
- `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and it is less than or equal to `n`.
- `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`.

Since `remainder` has been updated, we will state it clearly.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n; d` is equal to `n // min_sum; `remainder` is equal to `n - d * min_sum`.**
