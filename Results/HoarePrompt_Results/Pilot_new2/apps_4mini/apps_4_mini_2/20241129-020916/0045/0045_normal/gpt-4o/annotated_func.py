#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1 because the current value of min_sum is greater than n.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`.
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n; d` is equal to `n // min_sum; remainder` is 0; `sequence` is equal to `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which reflects that all remaining remainder has been distributed into the sequence.
    return sequence
    #The program returns the sequence which is equal to [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)], where d is equal to n // min_sum and min_sum is equal to k * (k + 1) // 2, which is less than or equal to n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers and checks if this sum exceeds `n`. If it does, the function returns -1. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function calculates how many times this minimum sum can fit into `n`, adjusts for any remainder, and returns a sequence of length `k` where the `i-th` element is incremented appropriately based on the division and remainder calculations. The function ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `n`.
