The variable `a` is assigned the previous value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Given that `b` must be greater than 0 and less than `a`, we can conclude that the new values must conform to these constraints. The value of `a` will now be equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` will be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`; `b` is equal to `a % b`, where `b` must be greater than 0 and less than the previous value of `a`.**
