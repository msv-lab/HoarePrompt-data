The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, where `n` must be in the range of 1 to 10^18 and `k` must be in the range of 2 to 10^18. After executing the function body, it returns the numerator modulo 10. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the result of the numerator modulo 10. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and returns the numerator modulo 10.**
