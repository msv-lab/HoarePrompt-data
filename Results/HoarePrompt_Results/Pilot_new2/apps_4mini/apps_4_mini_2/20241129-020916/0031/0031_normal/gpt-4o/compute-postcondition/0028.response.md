Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. It performs calculations based on these parameters but does not return any values. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, it prints `(1, 1)` and exits. Otherwise, it computes the number of possible selections of `k` items from `2^n` items, handling calculations modulo `1000003`, and prints the final results after further calculations. However, the function does not return anything explicitly, and thus its output is solely through printed values, not a return statement.**
