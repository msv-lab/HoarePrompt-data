The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. It calculates the number of ways to choose `k` items from `2^n` total items, returning the simplified numerator and denominator of that fraction, both modulo `10^6 + 3`. If `k` is larger than `total_days`, the numerator may become zero, affecting the output.
