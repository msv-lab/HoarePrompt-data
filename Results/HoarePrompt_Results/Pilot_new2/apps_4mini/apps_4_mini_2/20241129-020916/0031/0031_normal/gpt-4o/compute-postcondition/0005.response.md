The variable `total_days` is assigned the value `1 << n`, which represents 2 raised to the power of `n`. Given that `n` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\), the value of `total_days` will be equal to \(2^n\). The other variables `k` and `MOD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\)**.
