To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code against the problem description, examine potential edge cases, and ensure that the output hints align with the code's functionality.

### Problem Description
The task is to calculate the probability that at least two out of `k` people have the same birthday given `2^n` days in a year. The result should be printed as an irreducible fraction `A/B` modulo `1000003`, where `A` and `B` are coprime.

### Function Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of two integers. It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is reliable and will terminate as expected given that `a` and `b` are integers within the defined ranges.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**
   - The function checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If true, it correctly returns `(1, 1)` since it guarantees that at least two people will share a birthday. This behavior aligns with the problem description.
   - For other cases, it calculates the numerator and denominator for the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday using the complementary counting method. The calculations are done modulo `1000003`, which is appropriate since results can be large.
   - It uses `func_1` to compute the GCD and reduce `A` and `B` to their simplest form before printing them modulo `1000003`.

### Edge Cases Considered
- **Case where `k` exceeds `2^n`:** The code correctly handles this by returning `(1, 1)`.
- **Very large values of `n` and `k`:** The program must manage large computations effectively. The code structure does not inherently limit its handling of large integers since Python's int type can manage arbitrarily large integers. However, the calculations for `numerator` and `denominator` should be checked for performance, but since these are done modulo `1000003`, they should not run into overflow issues.
- **Values of `n` where `2^n` is very small (e.g., `n = 1`):** The output description aligns with the expected results from the examples provided.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function calculates the probability and prints the values of `A` and `B` in an irreducible form before taking modulo `1000003`. This matches the intended behavior as described in the problem.

### Conclusion
Upon evaluating the code and the problem description against potential cases and the output hints, we find that the program correctly handles all specified scenarios and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the probability of shared birthdays under the given constraints and handles the modular arithmetic as required, ensuring that the output fraction is irreducible.
