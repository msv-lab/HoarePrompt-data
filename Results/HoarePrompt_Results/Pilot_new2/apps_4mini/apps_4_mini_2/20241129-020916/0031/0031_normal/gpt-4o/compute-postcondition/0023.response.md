To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code, we need to analyze how the function `func_1` affects the variables. However, since we don't have the actual implementation of `func_1`, let's summarize the initial state and outline its preservation along with the assignment to `g`.

Given the initial state, we have:

- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is an integer where \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\)
- `MOD` is 1000003
- `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\)
- `numerator` is \((2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times (2^n - 2) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003\)
- `denominator` is \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\)
- `p_no_shared` is equal to the value of `numerator`
- `p_total` is \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\)
- `p_shared` is \((p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) \mod MOD\)
- `A` is equal to `p_shared`
- `B` is equal to \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\)

Now, when we execute `g = func_1(A, B)`, the values of `A` and `B` are passed to `func_1`, and `g` will be assigned whatever value this function returns. However, since we do not know the specific operations or the return value of `func_1`, we can only specify that `g` is now assigned the result of that function call.

The remaining variables retain their prior values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `g` is assigned a value based on the execution of `func_1` with the current values of `A` and `B`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n; `numerator` is (2^n) × (2^n - 1) × (2^n - 2) × ... × (2^n - (k - 1)) mod 1000003; `denominator` is (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `p_no_shared` is equal to the value of numerator; `p_total` is (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `p_shared` is (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) mod MOD; `A` is equal to p_shared; `B` is equal to (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`.**
