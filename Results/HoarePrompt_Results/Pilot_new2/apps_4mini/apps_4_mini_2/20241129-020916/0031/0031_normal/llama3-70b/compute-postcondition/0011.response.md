The `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. The initial value of `denominator` is 4, and `total_days` is 2. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` becomes 4 * 2 = 8. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `k` must be greater than 2, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 8, `i` is 2**.
