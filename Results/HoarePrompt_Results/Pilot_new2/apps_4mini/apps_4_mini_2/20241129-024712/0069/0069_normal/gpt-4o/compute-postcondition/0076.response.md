The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` retrieves an element from the `data` list at the position indicated by `index`. The value of `n` is now explicitly determined by the content of `data` at that index, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `index` is at least 3, `s` is a valid string, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`.**
