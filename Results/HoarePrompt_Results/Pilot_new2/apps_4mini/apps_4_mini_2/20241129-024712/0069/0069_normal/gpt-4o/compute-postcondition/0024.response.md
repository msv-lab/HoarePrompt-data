Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the sum of the counts of '0's minus the counts of '1's in the first `i` characters of `s`. If `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, `results` now contains -1 appended to it. Otherwise, if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` now includes an additional element `0`.***
