The variable `results` is assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `x` is an integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `data` is a list of strings from the input, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.
