Precondition: **T is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two values: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100000) representing the length of the binary string s, and x is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9) representing the desired balance. The binary string s is of length n and consists only of characters '0' and '1'. The total length of all strings s across test cases does not exceed 100000.**
