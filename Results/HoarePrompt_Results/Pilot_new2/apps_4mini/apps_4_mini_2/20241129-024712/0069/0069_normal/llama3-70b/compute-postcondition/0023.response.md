Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `_` is equal to `T`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is another input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, the output is the value of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
