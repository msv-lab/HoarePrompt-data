The variable `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`. If `s[i - 1]` is `'0'`, then `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1`, otherwise, it is `prefix_balances[i]` equals `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1`. The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is dependent on the condition of `s[i - 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be at least 4, `index` must be at least 3, `s` is a valid string, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1` if `s[i - 1] == '0' else `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1`.**
