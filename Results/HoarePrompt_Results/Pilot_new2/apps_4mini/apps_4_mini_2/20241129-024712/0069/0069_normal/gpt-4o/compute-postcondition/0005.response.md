According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the variable `T`. The loop will execute `T` times, and since `T` is between 1 and 100, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. The initialization state of `index` is 1, which means it is set to start from the second iteration in a zero-based index scenario. 

To ensure the loop executes correctly:

1. `T` must remain between 1 and 100, which is already satisfied.
2. The variable `index` needs to be managed correctly based on the loop iterations. After the first iteration, `index` should be incremented to 2 for the second execution and so on.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are primarily related to the iterations and the list of results.

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is between 1 and 100,000, `x` is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `data` is a list of strings from the input, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
