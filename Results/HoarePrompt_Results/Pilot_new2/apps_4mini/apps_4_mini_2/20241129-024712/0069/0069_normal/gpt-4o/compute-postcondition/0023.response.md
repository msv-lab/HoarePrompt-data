The code snippet `results.append(0)` adds the integer 0 to the `results` list. The initial state indicates that other variables remain unchanged, but the `results` list is modified by appending a new element.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the sum of the counts of '0's minus the counts of '1's in the first `i` characters of `s`, the current value of `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes an additional element `0`.**
