Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the sum of the counts of '0's minus the counts of '1's in the first `i` characters of `s` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), the current value of `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`.***
