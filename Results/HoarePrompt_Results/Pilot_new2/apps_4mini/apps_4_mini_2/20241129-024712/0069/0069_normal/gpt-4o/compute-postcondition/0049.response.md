According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 3, and `n` must be at least 1. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is at least 3, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the updated states are:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4.
- `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be at least 4, `index` must be at least 3, `s` is a valid string, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
