According to the code, the loop will execute a total of `T` times. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `T` is between 1 and 100, meaning there could be more iterations remaining based on the value of `T`. The loop variable (underscore `_`) is typically not used within the loop body, so there is no change to that variable that needs to be tracked. 

Since the loop will execute exactly `T` times and the state indicates that the current iteration has already reached at least 3 (as `index` is at least 3), we need to consider the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must still be greater than the current iteration count. If the loop has executed 3 times already, we can infer that `T` must be greater than 3. Therefore, `T` must be at least 4 for another iteration to occur.

State: **`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is at least 1, `index` is at least 3, `s` is a valid string, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`.**
