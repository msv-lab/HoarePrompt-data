Correctness: **False**.

The program has issues in handling certain edge cases. 

1. The condition `elif (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0:` does not take into account the case where both `cnt0` and `cnt1` are zero (i.e., when the string `s` consists entirely of either `0`s or `1`s). In this case, if `x` is not equal to `balance`, the condition could lead to a division by zero error or an incorrect conclusion.

2. It also incorrectly calculates the number of valid prefixes when the balance is negative or when `x` is less than `balance` and `cnt0` is less than `cnt1`. 

For instance:
- If `s = "0"` (where `cnt0 = 1`, `cnt1 = 0`, hence `balance = 1`), and you check for `x = 0`, the program would output `1`, which does not reflect the correct interpretation of the infinite possible prefixes because you can also reach a balance of `0` infinitely by adding more `1`s from the infinite string `t`.

Thus, the implementation does not correctly handle all cases described in the problem statement.
