The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `assigned`, `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
