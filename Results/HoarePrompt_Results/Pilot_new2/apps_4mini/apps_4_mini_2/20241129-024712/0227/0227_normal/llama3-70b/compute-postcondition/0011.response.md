According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which ranges from 1 to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which is `1` less than `n` (since the loop starts from `1`). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `2`. 

The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` needs to be less than `n`. 

State: **`a[i]` is not equal to double `a[i - 1]`, `m` is 3; `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
