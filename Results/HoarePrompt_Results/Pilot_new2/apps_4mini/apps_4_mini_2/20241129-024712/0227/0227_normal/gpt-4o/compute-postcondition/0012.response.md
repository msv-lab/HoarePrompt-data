The value of `can_form` is already set to `True`, so executing the line `can_form = True` does not change its value. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, and `can_form` is True, and `x` is `assigned[1]`.**
