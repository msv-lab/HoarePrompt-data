The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous state indicates that `can_form` was already `True`, so its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, and `x` is `assigned[2]**
