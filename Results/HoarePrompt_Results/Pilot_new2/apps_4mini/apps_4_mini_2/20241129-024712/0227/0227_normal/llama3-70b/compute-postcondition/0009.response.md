In the given scenario, `m` is initially set to 2 if the condition regarding `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is satisfied. The code then increments the value of `m` by 1. Thus, the final value of `m` will be 3.

Therefore, the values of the affected variables are updated accordingly. The other variables retain their values as stated in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 3**
