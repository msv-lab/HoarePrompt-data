Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately implement the requirements described in the problem statement. Here's why it fails to meet the criteria:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating m**: The program attempts to compute the minimum number of variables `m` by counting how many elements in the sorted list `a` are not double the previous element. This logic does not correspond to the problem requirement, which is centered around being able to perform operations based on the sums of previously assigned variable values, rather than just checking for doubling relationships in a sorted list.

2. **Missing Validity Check for Operations**: The problem description requires that for each operation, the sequence of assignments can be performed with the given variables. The program does not check whether each `a[t]` can actually be formed using the previous variables, which is a critical part of determining the feasibility of the operations described. There are many cases in which the sequence cannot be achieved even if the count of non-double elements leads to a certain number of variables.

3. **Example Cases**: 
   - For the input `3 6 5`, the correct output should be `-1` because it's impossible to perform the operations with the available values, but the logic of counting non-doubles will not yield this result correctly.
   - For the input `6 2 4 8 6 10 18`, the program could incorrectly compute the number of variables based on how many numbers are not double their predecessors, without considering their actual feasibility to be formed through the operations defined in the problem.

In conclusion, the program does not adhere to the operational requirements presented in the problem description, and thus it does not reliably determine the minimum number of variables needed or whether the operations can be performed at all.
