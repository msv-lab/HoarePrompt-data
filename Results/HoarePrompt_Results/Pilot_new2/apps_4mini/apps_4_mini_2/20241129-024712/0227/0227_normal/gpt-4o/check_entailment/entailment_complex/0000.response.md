Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. The main issue lies in the logic of how the variables are utilized and how the sums are formed.

1. **Inability to Form Values**: The problem description requires that after assigning the first value from the sequence to one of the variables (let's call it `b_x`), each subsequent value must be formed by the sum of values in previously assigned variables. The algorithm checks if the current number (from the sequence) can be formed by the difference of any two previously assigned variables, which is not the requirement. The requirement is to check if it can be formed as a sum, not a difference.

2. **Counting Variables**: The algorithm increments the count of variables `m` whenever it finds that the current number cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned variables. However, it doesnâ€™t ensure that the correct number of variables are allocated based on the sequence of operations as described. The condition for incrementing `m` does not adhere to the operations specified in the problem.

3. **Returning -1**: The program does not handle cases where it is not possible to perform the sequence of operations, as mentioned in the problem description when it suggests returning -1. The implementation logic does not cover this scenario.

For these reasons, the program does not correctly follow the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion of incorrect functionality.
