The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `assigned` remain unchanged. Since `can_form` is set to `False`, it indicates that whatever condition it was meant to represent is not satisfied.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `assigned` contains elements, `a[i]` has been added to the set `assigned`, and `can_form` is False.**
