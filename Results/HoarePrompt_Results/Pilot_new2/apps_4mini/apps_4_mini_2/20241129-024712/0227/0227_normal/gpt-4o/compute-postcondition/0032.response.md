The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This does not affect any of the other variables or their states. The initial conditions remain valid after the assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, `can_form` is True**.
