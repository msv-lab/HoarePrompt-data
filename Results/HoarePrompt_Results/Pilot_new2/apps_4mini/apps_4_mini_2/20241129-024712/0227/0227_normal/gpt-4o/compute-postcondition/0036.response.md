The value of `can_form` is assigned to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `assigned`, `can_form` is True**.
