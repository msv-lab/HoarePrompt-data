To determine the correctness of the provided program, we must analyze its logic and potential edge cases in relation to the problem description.

### Breakdown of the Problem:
1. **Location Calculation**: The program calculates the block and floor of the apartments using the function `get_location`.
2. **Time to Exit**: It calculates the time to exit from Edward's apartment.
3. **Walking Time**: The program computes the walking time between blocks both in the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, ensuring to find the minimum.
4. **Time to Target Floor**: It calculates the time to reach the target floor from the first floor after exiting.

### Potential Cases and Issues:
- **Block Calculation**: The block is calculated using integer division, which can lead to issues if not correctly handled. The calculation seems to be correct, as it divides the apartment number correctly based on the number of apartments per block.
  
- **Floor Calculation**: Similar to block calculation, the floor determination also appears correct.

- **Time to Exit**: This section has a potential edge case: if Edward is already on the first floor (floor_a = 1), the time to exit should be 0, which is handled correctly.

- **Walking Time Calculation**: The walking time is calculated based on the absolute difference of blocks and uses modulo for wrapping around the building. However, the walking time may not correctly account for cases where the distance between blocks is zero, which would imply they are already in the same block.

- **Target Floor Time Calculation**: The time to reach the target floor is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. This is correct as long as Edward has exited the building.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Same Block Check**: If `a` is in the same block as `b` but on different floors, the walking time calculation would yield a walking time of `0` since the distance between blocks is zero. The total time in this scenario would consist only of the time to exit and the time to reach the desired floor. 

2. **Minimum Input Values**: For `n = 1, m = 1, k = 1`, `a=1`, and `b=2` would lead to an invalid scenario since apartment numbers should be distinct, but let's take valid inputs for analysis.

3. **Different Scenarios**: For example, if `n=2, m=2, k=2`, `a=3`, and `b=5` (Edward is in block 1, floor 2, and Natasha is in block 2, floor 1). Here the calculation should correctly account for walking around the building.

In summary, while the program seems to execute the main logic as per the problem description, there's a subtlety in the walking time calculation that may lead to incorrect results if Edward and Natasha are in the same block but on different floors. This could lead to an underestimation of time, especially if he spends no time walking at all and directly goes to the floor.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not account for the scenario where both Edward and Natasha are in the same block but on different floors, leading to incorrect walking time calculations.
