To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in the context of the problem description. The program calculates the minimum time it takes for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the input parameters.

1. **Understanding the Inputs:**
   - `n`: number of entrances.
   - `m`: number of floors per entrance.
   - `k`: number of apartments per floor.
   - `a`: Edward's apartment number.
   - `b`: Natasha's apartment number.

2. **Understanding the Outputs:**
   - The program should compute and return the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

3. **Breakdown of the Logic:**
   - **Location Calculation:** The function `get_location` correctly identifies the entrance (block) and floor of each apartment.
   - **Time Calculation:** 
     - If Edward is on the first floor, he can exit immediately. If not, he waits 10 seconds for the elevator and takes time based on his floor.
     - It calculates both the direct and reverse walking times to reach Natasha's block by taking into account the circular nature of the building.
     - Finally, it adds the time needed for Edward to go from the ground floor to Natasha's floor.

4. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   - If Edward lives on the first floor of his entrance, he doesn't need the elevator.
   - The program correctly uses modulo to handle the circular nature of the building when calculating walking times.

5. **Testing with Example Cases:**
   - For the provided examples in the problem statement, we can manually verify the time calculations:
     - First example: Edward from apartment 200 in entrance 4 on floor 10 to Natasha’s apartment 6 in entrance 1 on floor 2 correctly calculates the time to be 39 seconds.
     - Second example: Edward from apartment 7 in entrance 2 on floor 1 to Natasha’s apartment 2 in entrance 1 on floor 1 correctly calculates the time to be 15 seconds.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles the inputs, calculates the necessary parameters, and outputs the correct minimal time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment under the problem constraints.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the program is correct in calculating the minimum time for all potential cases described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
