The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned based on the input provided through `input()`, which is split into three parts and converted to integers. The specific values for `n`, `m`, and `k` are not known, as they will depend on user input. The other variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned values based on user input.**
