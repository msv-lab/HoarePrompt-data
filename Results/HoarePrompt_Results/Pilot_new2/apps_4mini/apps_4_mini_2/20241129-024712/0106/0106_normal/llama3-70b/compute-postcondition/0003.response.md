The value of `a_block` is calculated using the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on user input. Thus, `a_block` will depend on the specific inputs for `a`, `m`, and `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers based on user input; `a` is equal to user input value 1; `b` is equal to user input value 2; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
