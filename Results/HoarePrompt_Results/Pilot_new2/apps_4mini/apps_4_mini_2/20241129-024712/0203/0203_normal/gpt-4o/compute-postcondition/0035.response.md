The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it is removed, and `r_queue` is modified to remove that first element. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains the elements after removing the first element, `d_index` is the value of the first element of `d_queue` before it was removed; `r_queue` is now one element shorter and `r_index` is the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains the elements after removing the first element; `d_index` is the value of the first element of `d_queue` before it was removed; `r_queue` is now one element shorter; `r_index` is the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed.**
