Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, if the first character of `votes` (denoted as `v`) is 'D', then `d_queue` contains [0], and `r_queue` is an empty list. If `v` is not equal to 'D', then `d_queue` is an empty list and `r_queue` contains [0].***
