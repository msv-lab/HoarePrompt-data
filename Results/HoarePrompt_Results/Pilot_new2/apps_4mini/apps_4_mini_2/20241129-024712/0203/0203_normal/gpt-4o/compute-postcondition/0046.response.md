Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It then processes the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters in a queue-like fashion, comparing their indices to determine which character ultimately "wins." The function will print 'D' if 'D' characters remain after processing, or 'R' if 'R' characters remain. If both queues are empty, the last printed character is the winner based on the comparisons that were made. The function assumes input string consists only of 'D' and 'R' characters without handling invalid inputs.**
