The code snippet `d_queue.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the `d_queue` list. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `d_queue` will contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `d_queue` now contains the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` contains [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the first character of `votes` (denoted as `v`) is 'D'.**
