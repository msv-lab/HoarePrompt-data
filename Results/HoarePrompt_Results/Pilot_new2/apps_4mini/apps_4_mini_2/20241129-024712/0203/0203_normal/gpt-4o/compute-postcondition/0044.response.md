Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is not empty, then elements from `d_queue` have been processed and 'D' has been printed to the output. If `d_queue` is empty, then 'R' has been printed, and the state of `r_queue` will depend on the comparisons of indices; both queues may be empty if all indices have been processed.***
