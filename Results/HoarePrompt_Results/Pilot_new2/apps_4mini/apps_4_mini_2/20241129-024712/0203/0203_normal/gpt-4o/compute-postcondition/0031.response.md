The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`, the new value added to `r_queue` will be `r_index + n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains one less index; `r_queue` contains one additional index, `d_index` is the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`; `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`; `r_queue` now contains the value `r_index + n` appended to it.**
