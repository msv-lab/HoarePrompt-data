The statement `d_queue.append(d_index + n)` implies that a new element is being added to the `d_queue`. The value being added is the sum of `d_index` and `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `d_index` is the value of the first element of `d_queue` before it was removed, the new value will be `d_index + n`.

Since `d_queue` is modified by appending this new value, we need to reflect this change in the output state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` now contains its previous elements plus the value `d_index + n`; `d_index` is the value of the first element of `d_queue` before it was removed; `r_queue` is now one element shorter; `r_index` is the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed.**
