In this case, the variable `i` is assigned the value of the length of `votes`, which is a non-empty string. Therefore, `i` will be a positive integer as well. The code appends this value of `i` to the `d_queue`, which was previously not defined but is now being modified to include this length. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is the length of `votes`, and `d_queue` now includes the integer `i`.**
