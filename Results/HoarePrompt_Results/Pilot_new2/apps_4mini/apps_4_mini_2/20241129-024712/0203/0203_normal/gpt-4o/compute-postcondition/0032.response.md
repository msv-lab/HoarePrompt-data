Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` now contains the value `d_index + n` appended, while `r_queue` contains one less index. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `d_queue` contains one less index and `r_queue` contains one additional index, with `r_queue` now containing the value `r_index + n` appended to it.***
