Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` may be empty depending on the comparisons of indices. The final state of `d_queue` includes elements of the form `d_index + kn` for some integer `k` if those indices were initially less than the corresponding elements in `r_queue`. The final state of `r_queue` includes elements of the form `r_index + kn` for some integer `k` if those indices were initially greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `d_queue`. Since the condition of the if statement is true, `d_queue` is not empty, indicating that there are elements present in `d_queue` that have been processed through the loop. If both queues are empty, all indices have been processed through the loop.***
