The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The initial state already indicates that `depublicans` is appropriately adjusted based on the second character of the `fractions` string. Therefore, after execution, the only change is that `depublicans` increases by 1, but the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string of 'D' and 'R' with at least 3 characters, `depublicans` is increased by 1, and `remocrats` is appropriately adjusted based on the second character.**
