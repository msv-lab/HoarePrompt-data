According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `seen` is a set containing 0, `remainder` is 0**
