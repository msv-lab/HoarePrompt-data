According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `k` is at least 1, the next value for `i` will be 2. Additionally, `k` must remain at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18` and `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `seen_remainders` now contains 0, `remainder` is 0, and the value of `remainder` (0) is present in `seen_remainders**
