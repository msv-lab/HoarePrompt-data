The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined to take no arguments. However, based on the provided constraints, we infer that it operates under the assumption that there are two integer variables `n` and `k`, with the constraint that both `n` and `k` satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Without knowing what the function does or the expected return value, we cannot detail the functionality accurately. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined due to the lack of output details. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly and its output is not specified.**
