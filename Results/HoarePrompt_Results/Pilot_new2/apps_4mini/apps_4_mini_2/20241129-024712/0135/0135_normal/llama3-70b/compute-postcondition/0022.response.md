The code snippet prints 'Yes', but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no variables modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k + 1`, `seen` is a set containing all unique remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k`, `remainder` is equal to `n % k`.**
