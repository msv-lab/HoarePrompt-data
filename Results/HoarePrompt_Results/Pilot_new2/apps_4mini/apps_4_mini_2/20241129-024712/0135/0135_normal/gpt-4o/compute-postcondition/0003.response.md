The variable `seen_remainders` is assigned the value of an empty set. This does not affect the values of `n` and `k`, but it introduces a new variable into the program. The original conditions for `n` and `k` still hold true. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than `n`; `seen_remainders` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than `n`; `seen_remainders` is an empty set.**
