According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from `1` to `k + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least `1` since the range function generates numbers starting from `1`. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at `1` during the first iteration. The current state of `n` does not affect the execution of this loop directly, but it's important to keep it in context. Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are that `k` must be at least `1` and `i` must be initialized to `1`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen` is an empty set**
