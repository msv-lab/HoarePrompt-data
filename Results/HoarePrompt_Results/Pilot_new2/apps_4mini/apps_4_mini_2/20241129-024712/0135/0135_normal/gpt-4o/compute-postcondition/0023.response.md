Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any remainder obtained from `n % i` (for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`) has already been seen. It returns 'Yes' if all remainders are unique across that range. **
