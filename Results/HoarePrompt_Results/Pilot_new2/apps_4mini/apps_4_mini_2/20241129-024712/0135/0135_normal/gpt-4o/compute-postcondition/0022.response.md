The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

- Case 1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- Case 2: If the current value of the remainder is already in the set of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'.
- Case 3: The function returns 'No' (condition not specified).
- Case 4: The function returns 'No' (condition not specified).
- Case 5: If a positive condition is met, likely based on the unique remainders obtained from `n % i` for `i` in the range 1 to `k`, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on various conditions regarding their values and the remainders, it returns either 'No' or 'Yes'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, and returns 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n, if the remainder is already seen, or based on unspecified conditions; otherwise, it returns 'Yes' when a positive condition related to unique remainders is met.**
