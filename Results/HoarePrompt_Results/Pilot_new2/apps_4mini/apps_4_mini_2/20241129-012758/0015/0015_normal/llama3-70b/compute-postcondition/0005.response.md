The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variable. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their previous state, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers updated to the values obtained from user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; current value of `c` is 0; `a` is not equal to `b`; 'NO' has been printed.**
