The code snippet provided is a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged after this execution. Since no variables are modified or returned in the output, we retain the existing conditions about `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers updated to the values obtained from user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, and `c` is not equal to 0. The expression `(b - a) % c` is not equal to 0 or `(b - a) / c` is less than 0; the output is 'NO'.**
