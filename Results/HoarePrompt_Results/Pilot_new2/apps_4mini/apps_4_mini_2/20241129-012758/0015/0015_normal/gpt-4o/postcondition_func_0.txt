The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; it prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If none of the conditions are met for printing, nothing is printed.
