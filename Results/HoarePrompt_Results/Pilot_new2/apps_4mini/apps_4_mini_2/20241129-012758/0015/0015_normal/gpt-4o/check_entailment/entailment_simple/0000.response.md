To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the program's logic.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program should determine if a given integer `b` appears in a sequence defined by:
   - The first element `s_1 = a`.
   - The difference between consecutive elements is `c` such that `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c`.
2. The program should output "YES" if `b` can be expressed as `s_i` for some positive integer `i`, and "NO" otherwise.

### Conditions for `b` to be in the sequence:
- If `c = 0`:
  - The sequence remains constant at `a`. Thus, if `a == b`, the output should be "YES". If `a != b`, it should be "NO".
- If `c != 0`:
  - We can find `i` such that `b = a + (i - 1) * c`. Rearranging gives:
    - `b - a = (i - 1) * c`
    - This implies `b - a` must be divisible by `c` (`(b - a) % c == 0`).
    - Additionally, we need `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which ensures that `i - 1` is non-negative (meaning `i` is positive).

### Program Logic Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (b == a):
        print('YES')
    else:
        if (c == 0):
            print('NO')
        else:
            if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

1. **When `b == a`:** The program correctly outputs "YES", indicating that `b` is in the sequence since it's the first term.
  
2. **When `c == 0`:** 
   - The program outputs "NO" if `b` is not equal to `a`, which is correct because the sequence is constant and does not include any values other than `a`.

3. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, ensuring that `b` can potentially be an element of the sequence. 
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that the index `i` is positive. 

These conditions correctly implement the logic required to determine if `b` is present in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as outlined in the description. It handles all specified cases and adheres to the logic required to determine the presence of `b` in the sequence.

Correctness: **True**
