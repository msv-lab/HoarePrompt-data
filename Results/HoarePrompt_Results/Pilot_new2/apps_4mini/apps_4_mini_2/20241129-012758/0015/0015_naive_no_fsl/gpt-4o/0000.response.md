Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the code works based on the problem description:

1. If `b` is equal to `a`, it directly prints "YES", which is correct since `b` is indeed part of the sequence as the first element.
   
2. If `c` is zero, it checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If they are not equal, it prints "NO". This is also correct, as a sequence where `c` is zero would only consist of the single element `a`.

3. In the case where `c` is not zero, it calculates whether `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and whether `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer. This is correct because for any integer `b` to be part of the sequence `s`, the difference `(b - a)` must be a multiple of `c`, and the division must yield a non-negative result to confirm that `b` appears in the positive indices of the sequence.

The program handles all edge cases correctly as described in the problem statement. Therefore, I cannot find any input case for which the program fails to meet the requirements.
