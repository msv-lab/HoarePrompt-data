Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the given recipe ratio of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. It determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`) by finding the minimum of the available lemons, half the available apples, and one-quarter of the available pears. This ensures that the ratio required for the compote is maintained.

To elaborate further:
- If Nikolay has `a` lemons, `b` apples, and `c` pears, the expression `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` accurately computes the maximum lemons that can be used, because:
  - Each lemon requires 2 apples, hence `b // 2` limits the number of lemons based on the apples available.
  - Each lemon also requires 4 pears, hence `c // 4` limits the number of lemons based on the pears available.
  
The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which corresponds to the correct total of lemons, apples, and pears based on the maximum number of lemons that can be used.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where there are insufficient fruits to meet the recipe's requirements, resulting in a total of 0 when `a`, `b`, or `c` does not allow for any complete set of fruits. 

Overall, all potential cases conform to the problem description, yielding confident correctness in the implementation.
