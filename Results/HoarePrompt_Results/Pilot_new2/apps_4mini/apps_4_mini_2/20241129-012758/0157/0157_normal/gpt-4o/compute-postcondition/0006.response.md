The function `func` does not have any parameters defined in its signature. However, it is implied that it operates on three positive integer inputs: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. Given the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000, the function likely processes these inputs in some way.

Since there is no explicit output described in the prompt, we cannot ascertain the exact return value of the function. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality based on the accepted parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integers a, b, and c, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively, with constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000.**
