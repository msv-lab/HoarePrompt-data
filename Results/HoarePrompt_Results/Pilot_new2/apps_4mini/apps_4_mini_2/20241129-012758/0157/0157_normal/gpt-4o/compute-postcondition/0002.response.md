In the provided code, `c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input from the user and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged, but the value of `c` is updated to the new input integer. 

The initial state specifies that `c` is a positive integer, and now `c` will hold the value that the user inputs, which is also constrained to be between 1 and 1000. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input positive integer**
