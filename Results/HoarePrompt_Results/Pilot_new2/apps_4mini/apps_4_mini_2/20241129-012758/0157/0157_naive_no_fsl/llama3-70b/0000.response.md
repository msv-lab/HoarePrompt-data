Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote according to the specified recipe. It takes the number of lemons, apples, and pears as input and calculates how many complete sets of fruits can be used based on the ratio of 1:2:4.

1. It computes the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon`) by considering:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - The number of apples available divided by 2 (`b // 2`), as each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - The number of pears available divided by 4 (`c // 4`), as each lemon requires 4 pears.

2. The total number of fruits used is then calculated by combining:
   - `min_lemon` (lemons)
   - `min_lemon * 2` (apples)
   - `min_lemon * 4` (pears)

Given the constraints of the problem (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000), the program is correct for all valid inputs, including edge cases where Nikolay might have insufficient quantities of any fruit to make even one batch of compote. In such cases, the program would correctly output 0.

All provided examples in the problem description yield the correct output when passed through this program, further supporting its correctness.
