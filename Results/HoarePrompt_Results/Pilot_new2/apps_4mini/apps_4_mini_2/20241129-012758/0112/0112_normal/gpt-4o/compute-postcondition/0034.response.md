The value of `found` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where the second index is now True, and at least one index remains True; `found` is True.
