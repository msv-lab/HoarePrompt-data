The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, and `found` is `False`.
