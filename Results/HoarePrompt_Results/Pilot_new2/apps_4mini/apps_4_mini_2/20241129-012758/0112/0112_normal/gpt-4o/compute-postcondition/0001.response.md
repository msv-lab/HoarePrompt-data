The `used_cubes` list is initialized with `False` values, and its length is determined by the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the possible values for `used_cubes` can be either `[False]`, `[False, False]`, or `[False, False, False]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`.**
