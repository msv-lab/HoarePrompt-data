The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since the current value of `digits` includes '0', it will be removed, but the rest of the elements in `digits` will remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `cubes` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is equal to the input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists containing integers between 0 and 9, `digits` is a set containing string representations of all integers from all cubes, excluding '0'.**
