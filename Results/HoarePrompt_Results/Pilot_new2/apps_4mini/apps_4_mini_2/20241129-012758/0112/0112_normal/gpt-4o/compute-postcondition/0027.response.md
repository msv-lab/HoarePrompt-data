Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where at least one index is `True`, `found` is False, and the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is False while `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`.***
