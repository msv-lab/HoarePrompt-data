The code sets `used_cubes[i]` to `True`, which changes the state of the variable `used_cubes` at index `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Given the initial conditions, `used_cubes[i]` was previously `False`, and now it is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `found` is False, `i` is 0, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`.**
