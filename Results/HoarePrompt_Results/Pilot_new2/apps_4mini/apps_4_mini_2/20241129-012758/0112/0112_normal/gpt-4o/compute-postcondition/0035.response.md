The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where the second index is now True and at least one index remains True, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
