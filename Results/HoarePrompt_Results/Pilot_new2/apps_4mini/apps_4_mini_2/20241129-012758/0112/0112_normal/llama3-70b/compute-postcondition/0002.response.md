The variable `digits` is assigned an empty set. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, and `cubes` is a list of `n` lists, each containing 6 integers ranging from 0 to 9. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is equal to the input integer between 1 and 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists containing integers between 0 and 9; `digits` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is equal to the input integer between 1 and 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists containing integers between 0 and 9; `digits` is an empty set.**
