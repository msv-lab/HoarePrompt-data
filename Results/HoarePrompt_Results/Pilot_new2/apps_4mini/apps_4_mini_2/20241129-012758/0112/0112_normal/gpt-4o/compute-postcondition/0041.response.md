Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where at least one index is True; if `used_cubes[2]` was False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
