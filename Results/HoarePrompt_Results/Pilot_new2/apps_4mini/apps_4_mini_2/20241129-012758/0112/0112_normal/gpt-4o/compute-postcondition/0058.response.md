Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `found` is True, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
