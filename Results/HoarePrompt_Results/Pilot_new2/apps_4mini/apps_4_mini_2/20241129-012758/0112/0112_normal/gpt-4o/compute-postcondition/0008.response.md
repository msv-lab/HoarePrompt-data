The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` at index 0 and `False` elsewhere, `found` is True, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[i]` is `True`, and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
