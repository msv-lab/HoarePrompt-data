The function accepts an integer `n` (1 to 3) and a list of `n` cubes (each with 6 digits). It returns the maximum integer `x` that can be formed from the digits of the cubes, which may exceed the expected values of 1, 2, or 3 depending on the digits available, since the logic for forming numbers is determined by the `can_form_number` function.
