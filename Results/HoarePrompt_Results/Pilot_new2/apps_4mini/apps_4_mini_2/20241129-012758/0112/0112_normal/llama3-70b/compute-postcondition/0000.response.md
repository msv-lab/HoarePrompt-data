The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicated that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Therefore, `n` will now take on a specific integer value between 1 and 3 based on user input. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, as they have not been affected by the execution of this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and each of the next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} where 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9 representing the digits on the faces of the cubes; `n` is now equal to the integer input value.**
