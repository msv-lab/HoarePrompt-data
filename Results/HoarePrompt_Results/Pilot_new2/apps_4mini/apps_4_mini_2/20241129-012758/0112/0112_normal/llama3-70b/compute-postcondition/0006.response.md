To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet step by step:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is equal to 2
  - `cubes` is a list of 2 lists containing integers between 0 and 9
  - `digits` is now a set containing string representations of the integers in the second cube
  - `cube` is the second list in `cubes`

Given that `cube` corresponds to the second list in `cubes`, let's denote this second list as `cube = cubes[1]`. The code snippet provided is:

```python
digits.update(str(digit) for digit in cube)
```

- The `update` method will add string representations of each integer in the `cube` to the `digits` set.
- The previous values of `digits` were the string representations of the integers in `cubes[1]`.
- After executing the code, `digits` will include both its previous values and the new string representations of the integers from `cube`.

Assuming that `cubes[1]` contains integers from 0 to 9 (as stated), `digits` will now hold those string representations as well.

Therefore, the output state must reflect the updated contents of `digits` after the execution of the code:

Output State: **`n` is equal to 2; `cubes` is a list of 2 lists containing integers between 0 and 9; `digits` is a set containing string representations of integers in the second cube (including previous values); `cube` is the second list in `cubes`.**
