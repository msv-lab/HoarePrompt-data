To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code against the problem description, which requires calculating the sum of numbers from \( l \) to \( r \) that contain at most \( k \) different digits.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Function `func_1(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the sum of numbers that meet the condition of having at most \( k \) different digits between \( l \) and \( r \).
   - It uses the `count` function to find the count of such numbers and computes the difference between counts up to \( r \) and \( l-1 \).
   - The result is taken modulo a constant \( MOD \).

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - This function aims to compute how many numbers up to \( n \) have at most \( k \) different digits.
   - It utilizes memoization to store previously computed results in the `dp` dictionary for efficiency.
   - The function checks if \( k \) is 0 and returns 0. It also has a condition where if \( n < 10^k \), it directly returns `n`. For larger numbers, it performs additional calculations.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The function does not explicitly handle \( n < 1 \) since the constraints ensure \( l \) and \( r \) are at least 1.
- The handling of \( k = 0 \) is well-defined since it returns 0, which is a sensible output within the context.

### Output Hints vs Code:
- The output hints provided for each function align well with the behavior of the respective implementations:
  - The first function's description matches its code, confirming that it computes the necessary counts for the range.
  - The second function description accurately describes the conditional logic used and the memoization method.
  
### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the functions and the problem description:
- The logic for counting numbers with at most \( k \) different digits seems to be implemented correctly.
- The summation logic in `func_1` is also sound, as it accurately computes the range sum based on the result of `count`.

The program accounts for all specified cases and conditions in the problem description. There are no edge cases that it fails to handle based on the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly calculates the sum of numbers with up to \( k \) different digits across the specified range, accurately adhering to the requirements laid out in the problem description.
