Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, and `k` is not equal to 0. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, with `n` greater than or equal to 10 and `k` in the range of 2 to 10, the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90` and `dp[n, k]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
