Given the initial state:

- `l` and `r` are integers such that \( 1 \leq l < r < 10^{18} \)
- `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10 \)
- `total_sum` is equal to \( l \mod MOD \)
- `num` is equal to \( l + 1 \)
- The condition is satisfied if `func_1(num, k)` returns true.

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code snippet:

```python
total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
```

1. The value of `num` is \( l + 1 \), which is always greater than \( l \) and less than or equal to \( r \).
2. The current value of `total_sum` is \( l \mod MOD \).
3. The new value of `total_sum` is updated to be the sum of the current `total_sum` and `num`, then taken modulo \( MOD \).

Calculating the new value of `total_sum`:
- The new `total_sum` will be \( (l \mod MOD + (l + 1)) \mod MOD \).

Since we don't know the exact values of `l` and `MOD`, we maintain the expression. No other variables are changed by this operation.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `total_sum` while retaining the other conditions.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is equal to `(l + 1 + l % MOD) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 1`, and if `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then the condition is satisfied.**
