The function `func_2` accepts three integer parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). The function iterates over all integers from `l` to `r` and checks each integer with the helper function `func_1`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns `True` for a particular integer `num`, that integer is added to a cumulative `total_sum`, which is then taken modulo `MOD`. The function finally returns this `total_sum`.

Key aspects include:
1. The function sums up only the integers in the specified range that meet the condition defined in `func_1`, which means it may not include all integers from `l` to `r`.
2. The return value is computed using modulo arithmetic, which may affect the result if `total_sum` exceeds `MOD`.
3. The annotations suggest that the function returns the sum modulo `MOD`, which aligns with how the function is structured.

Since the annotations do not mention the modulo operation and its impact on the final result, and there is no mention of handling cases where `func_1` might always return `False`, it is important to note that if no integers satisfy the condition, the total sum would remain zero.

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition defined by `func_1(num, k)`, taken modulo `MOD`. If no integers satisfy the condition, it returns 0. **
