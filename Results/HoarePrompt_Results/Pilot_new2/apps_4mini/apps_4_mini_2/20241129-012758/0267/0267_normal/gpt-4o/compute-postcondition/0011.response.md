To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the following points based on the provided code:

1. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive.
2. For each `num` in this range, if `func_1(num, k)` returns true, it contributes to `total_sum` by adding `num` to it, and we take the result modulo `MOD`.
3. The final value of `total_sum` will be the sum of all `num` values from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`.

Considering that the loop will execute for every integer value from `l` to `r`, and assuming that there are integers satisfying `func_1(num, k)`, we can summarize the final output state.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is equal to the sum of all integers `num` from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, taken modulo `MOD`.**
