Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `len(s)`; if `j` is equal to 26, then all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order; if `j` is less than 26, then not all characters of `target` were found in `s`. The current value of `j` is equal to `target_len`, indicating that all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order.***
