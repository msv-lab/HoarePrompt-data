The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `j` is currently 0, and it is increased to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, meaning that as `j` changes, the condition that `s[i]` equals `target[j]` might still hold true for the new value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the current value of `s[i]` is equal to the current value of `target[1]`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the current value of `s[i]` is equal to the current value of `target[1]**.
