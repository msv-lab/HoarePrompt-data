`res` is assigned the value `res + char`, which means that the string `char` ('a') is concatenated to the end of `res` ('aaaabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'). Therefore, the new value of `res` becomes 'aaaaabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is 'bababcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aaaaabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `char` is 'a'**
