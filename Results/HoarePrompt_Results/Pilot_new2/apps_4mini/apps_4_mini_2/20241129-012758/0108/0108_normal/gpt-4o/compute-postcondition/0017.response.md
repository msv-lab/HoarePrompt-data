To determine the output state after the while loop has executed, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop with respect to the provided initial state.

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.

The loop continues as long as `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len`. Each time the loop executes, it checks if the character at position `i` in `s` matches the character at position `j` in `target`. If it matches, `j` is incremented. Regardless, `i` is always incremented after each iteration.

After the loop has finished executing, the conditions can be summarized as follows:

1. The loop will continue until either:
   - All characters in `s` have been processed (i.e., `i` reaches `len(s)`), or
   - All characters in `target` have been matched (i.e., `j` reaches `target_len`, which is 26).

2. If `j` reaches 26, it implies that every character in `target` has been found in `s` in order. In this case, `j` will be equal to `target_len`, indicating that all target characters have been matched. 

3. If `i` reaches `len(s)` and `j` is less than 26, it means that not all characters in `target` were found within `s`.

Given these conditions, we can derive the output state after the loop has finished executing.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(s)`; if `j` is equal to 26, then all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order; if `j` is less than 26, then not all characters of `target` were found in `s`.**
