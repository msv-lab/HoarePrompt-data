The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it. The initial state mentions that `res` contains characters from 'a' to 'k' plus `char`, so after executing the code, `res` will include all previous characters plus the new `char`. The state of `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`s` must contain `char`; `res` contains characters from 'a' to 'k' plus `char` appended.**
