The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and checks whether it contains all the letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z') in order. If all letters are found in order, it prints the entire alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. If the input string has a length of 1 or does not contain all 26 letters in the correct order, the function will print -1.
