The variable `res` initially contains characters from 'a' to `k` plus `char`, which is `k + 2`. The code appends `char` to `res`. Since `char` is defined as `k + 2`, the new value of `res` will include this character again.

The impact of the code is that `char` is added to `res`, but since `char` is already part of `res` it does not change its original range. 

Therefore, the output state will indicate the unchanged range of `s` and `res`, with the new value of `res` reflecting that `char` has been appended to it.

Output State: **`s` contains characters from `k + 2` to 'z'; `res` contains characters from 'a' to `k` plus `char` (which is `k + 2`, included again)**
