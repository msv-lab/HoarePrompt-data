To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem requires that we can change any character in the string `s` to the next character in alphabetical order, with the goal of making the string contain "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" as a subsequence. 

The given program does the following:
1. It initializes a variable `alphabet` with the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".
2. It initializes an empty result string `res`.
3. It iterates over each character `char` in `alphabet`.
4. For each character, it checks if that character is present in the string `s`. If it is, it appends it to `res` and replaces that character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet (using `ord` to find the next character).
5. Finally, it checks if the length of `res` is 26 (indicating all letters of the alphabet have been found). If so, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Now let's analyze potential edge cases where this code may fail to meet the requirements:

- If the input string is "zz", the program would never be able to form the full alphabet because it can't map 'z' to 'a', and 'z' can't be changed further. Since the program checks if the length of `res` is 26 but doesn't account for the impossibility of getting letters beyond 'z', it would incorrectly print `-1`, while it should ideally handle such cases more explicitly.

- Additionally, the program has a flaw in its approach. If the input string contains characters that can only be transformed to characters that are already in `res`, the program might prematurely fill up `res` without checking if it can complete the alphabet. For example, with an input like "abcc", the program would end up with "abc", but would not be able to form the entire alphabet as a subsequence and would miss handling what to do next.

Given these points, we see that there are cases where the program does not behave as expected based on the requirements stated in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
