The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`, indicating that the string `s` is not a palindrome. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, specifically `s`, `n`, `i`, and the condition regarding the current characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1` of `s` still holds true. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `is_spalindrome`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `is_spalindrome` is False; the current character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1` of `s`.**
