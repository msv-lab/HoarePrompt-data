#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and if no False is returned, `s` is a palindrome.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the string 's' is a palindrome.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`.
