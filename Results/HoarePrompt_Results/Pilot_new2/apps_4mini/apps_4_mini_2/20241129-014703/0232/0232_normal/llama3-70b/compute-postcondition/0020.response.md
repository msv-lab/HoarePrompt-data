The variable `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This does not affect the other variables since they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `window_counts` is now an empty dictionary, while all other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`colors` is either empty or contains elements, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors, `found` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.**
