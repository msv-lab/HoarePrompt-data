To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variable `colors`, which the loop iterates over. 

1. The loop will only execute if `colors` is defined and contains elements. 
2. Since the program state mentions `color_counts` is an empty dictionary, it does not impact the loop directly but indicates that it will be populated within the loop.
3. The given state does not provide information about the contents of the `colors` variable, which is critical for the execution of the loop.

For the loop to execute, `colors` must be a list (or another iterable) with at least one element. We should also acknowledge the previous states before the loop begins.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary, `colors` must be a list that contains at least 1 element**
