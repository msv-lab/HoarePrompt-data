The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The current value of `left` is previously defined as the previous value plus 1, so now it becomes the previous value plus 2. The other variables, including `right` and `current_counts[colors[left]]`, remain unchanged as no further operations are performed on them in this code snippet.

Output State: **`left` is the previous value plus 2, `right` is `n`, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1.**
