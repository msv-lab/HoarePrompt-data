Postcondition: ***`left` is the previous value plus 1, `right` is `n`, and `current_counts` has been updated such that at least one `current_counts[color]` is still less than `desired_counts[color]`. If all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]`, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the counts match the desired amounts.***
