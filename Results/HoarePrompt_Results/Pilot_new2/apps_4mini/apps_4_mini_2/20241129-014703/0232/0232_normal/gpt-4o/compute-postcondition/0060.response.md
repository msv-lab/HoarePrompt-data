Output State: **`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` plus the total number of iterations executed; `current_counts` is equal to `desired_counts` for all colors in `desired_counts`; `right` is equal to `n`, and if the loop terminated without returning 'YES', it indicates that there were no colors in `desired_counts` for which `current_counts[color]` was less than `desired_counts[color]` at the end of the loop execution.**
