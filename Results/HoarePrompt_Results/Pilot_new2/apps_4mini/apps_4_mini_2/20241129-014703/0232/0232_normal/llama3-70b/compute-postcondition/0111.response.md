Output State: **`found` indicates whether the counts in `window_counts` matched the `counts`, `j` is `n - 1`, `window_counts` contains counts of the colors in `colors` from index `i` to `n - 1`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, and if the loop executed, `window_counts[color]` will reflect the counts of the last color processed, where `color` is `colors[n - 1]`.**
