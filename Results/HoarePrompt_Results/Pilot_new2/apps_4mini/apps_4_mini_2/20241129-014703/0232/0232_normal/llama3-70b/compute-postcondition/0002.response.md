The `counts` variable is assigned a list of integers, which are generated by mapping the `int` function over the input received from the user. Since `colors` is a list of integers from user input, the exact content of `counts` will depend on the specific integers input by the user. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged after this operation, but `counts` is now defined as a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `counts` is a list of integers from user input**.
