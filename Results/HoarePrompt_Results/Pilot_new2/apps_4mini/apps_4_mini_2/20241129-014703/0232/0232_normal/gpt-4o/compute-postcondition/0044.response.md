Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` plus the number of iterations executed, `current_counts` has been adjusted such that for every color in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is at least equal to `desired_counts[color]`, `right` is `n + 1`, and `current_counts` matches `desired_counts` for all colors in `desired_counts` (i.e., `current_counts[color] == desired_counts[color]` for all `color`).***
