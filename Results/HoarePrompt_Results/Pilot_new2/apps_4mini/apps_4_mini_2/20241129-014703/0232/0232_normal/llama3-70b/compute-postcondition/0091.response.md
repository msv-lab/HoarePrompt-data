Postcondition: ***`found` is true, `colors` may be empty or contain elements, `color` is `colors[2]` (if `colors` has at least 3 elements) or undefined (if `colors` has fewer than 3 elements), `color_counts` may be empty or contain counts of colors, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `window_counts[color]` is either `1` (if `color` was defined) or remains unchanged (if `color` was undefined), and all counts in `sorted(window_counts.values())` match the corresponding values in `counts` after sorting.***
