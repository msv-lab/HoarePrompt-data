Output State: **`colors` is either empty or contains elements; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors; `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` matched the corresponding values in `counts` at least once during the loop execution; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `j` is n-1 after the last iteration of the loop (if it executed); `window_counts` contains the counts of colors from the relevant section of `colors` processed by the loop, or remains unchanged if no colors were counted.**
