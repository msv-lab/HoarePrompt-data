Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, and `current_counts` and `desired_counts` are arrays with specific properties. If all the current_counts for each color equal the corresponding desired_counts, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.***
