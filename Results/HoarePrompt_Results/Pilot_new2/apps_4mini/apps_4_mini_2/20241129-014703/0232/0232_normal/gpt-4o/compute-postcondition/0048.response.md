Output State: **`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` plus the number of iterations executed plus 1; `current_counts` has been adjusted such that for every color in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is at least equal to `desired_counts[color]`, except for the color `colors[left]` which is now `current_counts[colors[left]] - 1`; `right` is `n + 1`; there exists at least one color in `desired_counts` such that `current_counts[color]` is not equal to `desired_counts[color]`.**
