The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` entered by the user, rounds it to the nearest multiple of 10, and prints the result. If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, it adds the difference to reach the next multiple of 10. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated result.
