The value of `n` is reassigned to `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is initially a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the new value of `n` will also be within this range after the input. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**
