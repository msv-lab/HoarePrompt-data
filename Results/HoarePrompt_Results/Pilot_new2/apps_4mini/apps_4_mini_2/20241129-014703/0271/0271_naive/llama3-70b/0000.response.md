Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem statement. It checks if the number `n` is already ending in zero and returns it as-is. If `n` does not end in zero, it determines whether to round down or round up based on the last digit of `n`. 

- If the last digit is between 0 and 5 (inclusive), it rounds down by subtracting the remainder when `n` is divided by 10.
- If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference needed to reach the next multiple of 10.

All possible cases have been accounted for:
1. When `n` ends with 0, it returns `n`.
2. When `n` ends with a digit from 1 to 5, it rounds down correctly.
3. When `n` ends with a digit from 6 to 9, it rounds up correctly.

Given the constraints \( 0 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), the program handles all valid inputs according to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
