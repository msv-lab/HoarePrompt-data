The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. The parameter `chars` is a string that represents a sequence of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000. The parameter `sub` is a non-empty string that represents a substring of `chars` and can contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it generates and returns a list of all possible numbers formed by the digits in `chars` that can contain the substring `sub` at any position. Therefore, the functionality of the function `generate_possible_numbers` is to accept a string `chars` of digits and a non-empty string `sub`, and return a list of possible numbers that include `sub` within them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `chars` representing a sequence of digits and a non-empty string `sub` representing a substring, and returns a list of all possible numbers formed by the digits in `chars` that include `sub`.**
