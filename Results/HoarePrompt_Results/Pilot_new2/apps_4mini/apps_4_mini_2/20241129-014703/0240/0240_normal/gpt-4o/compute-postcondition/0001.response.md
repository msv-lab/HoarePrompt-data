`candidate` is assigned the value of the string obtained by joining the elements of `perm`. The value of `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, which is still a valid non-empty string containing digits. Therefore, `candidate` becomes the same as `perm`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
