According to the code, the loop will execute for each permutation of `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`. The next iteration will generate the next permutation of `chars`.

To execute the loop one more time, `perm` must be set to the next permutation in the sequence of permutations generated by the `permutations` function. Since the current `perm` is the first permutation, the next permutation will be the second one.

However, it is important to check the nature of the `chars` string. Since `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, it will generate multiple permutations. The next permutation should still be valid in terms of the permutations of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
