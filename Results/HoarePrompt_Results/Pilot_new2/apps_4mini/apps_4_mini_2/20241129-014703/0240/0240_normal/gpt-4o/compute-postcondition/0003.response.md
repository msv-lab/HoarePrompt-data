The `yield` statement produces a value and pauses the function's execution, allowing it to be resumed later. In this case, `candidate` is being yielded as the output from the function, while the values of `chars`, `perm`, and the validity of `candidate` and `sub` remain unchanged. The state of the variables indicates that `candidate` has been returned.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` has been returned, and `is_valid_number` has returned true for `candidate` and `sub`.**
