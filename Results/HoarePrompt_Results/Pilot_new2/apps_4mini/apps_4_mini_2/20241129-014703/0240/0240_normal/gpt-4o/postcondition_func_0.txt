The function accepts two non-empty strings `s` and `sub`, both consisting of digits. It calculates the frequencies of digits in `s` and subtracts the frequencies of digits found in `sub`. Then, it generates possible numbers using the remaining characters in `s` after the subtraction. Finally, it returns the smallest integer value from the generated numbers. If there are no remaining characters after the subtraction, this could result in an error when trying to compute the minimum, which is a potential edge case not handled in the annotations.
