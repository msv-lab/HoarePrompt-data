The variable `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, which is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 100. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `min_upvotes` and maintains the conditions of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.**
