The function `func` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`. All three parameters are integers with the constraints that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function does not have visible output details provided in the description. Therefore, based on the provided constraints and the absence of specific return cases, the functionality of the function cannot be explicitly defined. If further information on the output behavior of the function were available, a more precise functionality description could be provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters x, y, and z, all of which are integers constrained between 0 and 100 inclusive.**
