Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x` <= 100, 0 <= `y` <= 100, 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z` >= `y`).***
