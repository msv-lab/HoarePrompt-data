Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x` <= 100, 0 <= `y` <= 100, 0 <= `z` <= 100. If `max_upvotes` (i.e., `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (i.e., `y`), then `'-'` is printed. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` (i.e., `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `x`), then `'+'` is printed. If `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, then '?' is printed.***
