The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes input values, splits them, and converts them to integers. The initial values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain valid as integers within the range [0, 100]. After this operation, `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on user input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are new integers within the range [0, 100] based on user input.**
