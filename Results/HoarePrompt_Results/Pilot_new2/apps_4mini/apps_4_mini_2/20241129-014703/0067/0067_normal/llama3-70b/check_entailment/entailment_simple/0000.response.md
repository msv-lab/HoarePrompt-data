Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The key issue lies in how the program determines when the result is uncertain.

1. **Logic Flaw in Uncertainty Check**:
   - The program checks if `x > y + z` to print '+', which is correct. However, it checks `x < y` to print '-', which is also correct. 
   - The problem arises in the handling of the situation when `x` is equal to `y`. The program correctly checks if `z == 0` and prints '0', but when `z > 0`, it should print '?' because there may be uncertainty whether the result could be positive or negative depending on how the `z` unknown votes are distributed. The program does this part correctly.
   - However, it has a logical flaw in the else case where it checks if `x` is not equal to `y` and prints '?', which is incorrect. In this case, it should have evaluated whether the votes could lead to more than one possible outcome based on the value of `z`.

2. **The Missing Check**:
   - When `x < y + z` and `x > y`, it is possible that the result could still be uncertain if `z` is large enough. The else condition that leads to printing '?' does not capture all scenarios where uncertainty exists.

In conclusion, while the program works for many specific cases, it does not handle all scenarios as described in the problem statement, specifically around the conditions leading to an uncertain result. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem requirements accurately for all cases.
