To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and compare it with the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Given three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, where:
   - `x`: Number of guaranteed upvotes.
   - `y`: Number of guaranteed downvotes.
   - `z`: Number of uncertain votes (could be either upvotes or downvotes).

2. The results are determined as follows:
   - If `x + z` (maximum possible upvotes) is less than `y` (guaranteed downvotes), the result is `'-'`.
   - If `y + z` (maximum possible downvotes) is less than `x` (guaranteed upvotes), the result is `'+'`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, then the result is uncertain, represented by `'?'`, as there are different potential outcomes depending on how the uncertain votes are cast.

### Program Logic:
- The program reads the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
- It calculates `max_upvotes` as `x + z` and `max_downvotes` as `y + z`.
- It then checks:
  - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `'-'`.
  - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `'+'`.
  - If neither condition holds, it prints `'?'`.

### Verification:
- The program correctly identifies:
  - The case when the maximum possible upvotes cannot exceed the guaranteed downvotes.
  - The case when the maximum possible downvotes cannot reach the guaranteed upvotes.
  - The uncertain case when both upvotes and downvotes can overlap due to the uncertain votes.

### Edge Cases:
- The program must handle edge cases such as:
  - Situations where `z` is `0` (the outcome must be determined solely by `x` and `y`).
  - Situations where all values are `0` (the output should be `?`).
  
In all scenarios, the program accurately computes the possible outcomes based on the rules defined in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases as required. Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **True**
