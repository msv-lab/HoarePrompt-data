The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. Since `x` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 100, and `z` is also a non-negative integer within the same range, `max_upvotes` will also be a non-negative integer that can range from 0 (when both `x` and `z` are 0) to 200 (when both `x` and `z` are at their maximum values). The `min_upvotes` remains unchanged as it is equal to `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.**
