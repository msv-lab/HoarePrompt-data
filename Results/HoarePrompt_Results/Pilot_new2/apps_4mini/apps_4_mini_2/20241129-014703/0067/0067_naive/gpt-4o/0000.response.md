Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes and there are unknown votes. For example, consider the input `1 1 2`. In this case:

- Minimum upvotes = 1
- Maximum upvotes = 1 + 2 = 3
- Minimum downvotes = 1
- Maximum downvotes = 1 + 2 = 3

Here, it is possible for the result to be either `+`, `-`, or `0` depending on how the 2 unknown voters choose to vote. Thus, the output should be `?` because the result is uncertain, but the program will output `?` as it falls into the `else` case. 

However, if we take the input `1 1 0`, it outputs `0`, which is correct. But in the previous case with `1 1 2`, it should output `?` as both the maximums are equal.

Thus, since the program does not handle all cases as expected, the correctness is false.
