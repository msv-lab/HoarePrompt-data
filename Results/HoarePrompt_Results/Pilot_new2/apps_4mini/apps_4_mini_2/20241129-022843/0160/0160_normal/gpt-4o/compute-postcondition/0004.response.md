The statement `divisors.add(x // i)` adds the integer value of `x // i` to the `divisors` set. Given that `x` is a tuple where the first element is the integer `N`, the second element is the integer `K`, and the third element is a list of `N` integers `A`, we can extract the first element of `x` (which we'll refer to as `N`), and since the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, the operation `x // i` is valid.

Let's denote the first element (N) of tuple x as `n`, and since `i` is 1, the operation simplifies to `x // 1`, which equals `x`. 

Before the execution:
- `divisors` initially contains {1}.

After the execution:
- We add `x` to `divisors`.

Therefore, the new state of `divisors` will be {1, x}.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6).
- `i` remains 1.
- `N` remains as is.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6); `divisors` contains {1, x}; `i` is 1; `N` is at least 2.**
