You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N.
You can perform the following operation between 0 and K times (inclusive):
 - Choose two integers i and j such that i \neq j, each between 1 and N (inclusive). Add 1 to A_i and -1 to A_j, possibly producing a negative element.
Compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Here a positive integer x divides an integer y if and only if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 500
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_{N-1} A_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3
8 20

-----Sample Output-----
7

7 will divide every element of A if, for example, we perform the following operation:
 - Choose i = 2, j = 1. A becomes (7, 21).
We cannot reach the situation where 8 or greater integer divides every element of A.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where the first two integers represent N (the number of elements) and K (the maximum number of operations), followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N such that 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and 0 <= K <= 10^9.
def func_1(lst):
    gcd_result = lst[0]
    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers where the first integer N is greater than or equal to 1; `gcd_result` is equal to the GCD of all elements from `A_1` to `A_N`.
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns the GCD of all elements from A_1 to A_N in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` where the first integer represents N (the number of elements) and the subsequent integers represent a sequence of integers. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers from the list, starting from the second element to the N-th element. The function assumes that N is at least 2, and thus it does not handle cases where the list may have fewer than two integers. If the list contains only one integer (which is not allowed by the provided conditions), the behavior is not defined.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6).
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6); `divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` (the first element of the tuple), including 1 and `x` itself. If `x` is 1, then `divisors` contains only {1}.
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of all divisors of the first element N of the tuple x in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `x` where the first element is an integer `N` (between 2 and 500), the second element is an integer `K` (between 0 and 10^9), and the third element is a list of `N` integers. It calculates and returns a sorted list of all divisors of `N` in descending order. If `N` is 1, the output will still be {1}. However, the function does not utilize the second and third elements of the tuple `x`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
