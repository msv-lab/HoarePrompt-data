Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` positive integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, and `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`. If `gcd` is not equal to `i * i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to `max(max_divisor, gcd)`; otherwise, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
