The function accepts a tuple `x` where the first element is an integer `N` (between 2 and 500), the second element is an integer `K` (between 0 and 10^9), and the third element is a list of `N` integers. It calculates and returns a sorted list of all divisors of `N` in descending order. If `N` is 1, the output will still be {1}. However, the function does not utilize the second and third elements of the tuple `x`.
