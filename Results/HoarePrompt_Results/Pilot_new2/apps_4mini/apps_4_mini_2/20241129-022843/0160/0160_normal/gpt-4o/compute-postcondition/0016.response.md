The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a tuple containing three elements: the first element is an integer `N` (where 2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer `K` (where 0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of `N` integers `A` (where each A[i] satisfies 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6). After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list of all divisors of the first element `N` in descending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, which is a tuple containing an integer N, an integer K, and a list of N integers. It returns a sorted list of all divisors of N in descending order.**
