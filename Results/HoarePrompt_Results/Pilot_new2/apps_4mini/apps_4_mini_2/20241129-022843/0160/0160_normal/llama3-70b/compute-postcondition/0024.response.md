The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. The previous value of `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. Since `max_divisor` is being updated based on the maximum of its current value and `i`, it will take the greater of the two. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` positive integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, and `max_divisor` is updated to be max(max_divisor, i).**
