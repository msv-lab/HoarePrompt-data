The variable `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current value of `gcd` and `A[i]`, where `i` is equal to 3. The value of `gcd` depends on its previous value, which is equal to `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2])`, and the value of `A[3]`. Therefore, the output state is: 

`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9; `gcd` is updated to `math.gcd(gcd, A[3])`; `i` is 3.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9; `gcd` is updated to `math.gcd(gcd, A[3])`; `i` is 3.**
