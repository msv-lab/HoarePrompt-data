The value of `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the list `A`. The `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum value between its previous value and `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` positive integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and `max_divisor` is updated to `max(max_divisor, i)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` positive integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, `max_divisor` is updated to `max(max_divisor, i)`**.
