Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6), `divisors` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `N` is at least 2, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `(x % i == 0)`).***
