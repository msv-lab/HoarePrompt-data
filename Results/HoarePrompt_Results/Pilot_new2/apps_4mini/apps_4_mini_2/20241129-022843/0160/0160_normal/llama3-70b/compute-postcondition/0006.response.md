The variable `gcd` is updated to be the greatest common divisor of its current value and the value of `A[i]`, where `i` is 2. Since `gcd` is initially equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`, the new value of `gcd` will be `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2])`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2])`, `i` is 2**.
