The `min_pos` variable is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`. Given that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from `1` to `n`, and `1` is guaranteed to be present in the list, the index will be a valid integer between `0` and `n-1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`.**
