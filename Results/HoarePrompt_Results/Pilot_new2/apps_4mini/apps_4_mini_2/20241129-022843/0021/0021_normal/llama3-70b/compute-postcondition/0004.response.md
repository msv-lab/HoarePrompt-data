To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the program state based on the initial conditions provided.

1. `pos1` is the index of the integer 1 in the list `a`.
2. `posn` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`.
3. The code calculates `max_dist` using the formula: `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.

Now let's break down what this means:
- `abs(pos1 - posn)` gives the absolute distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list `a`.
- We then subtract 1 from this distance, which represents the number of elements between the two indices.
- We compare this modified distance with `n - 2`, which is the maximum possible distance between two distinct elements in a list of size `n` (only considering the distance between the first and the last element minus the endpoints).
- Finally, `max()` takes the greater of these two values to assign to `max_dist`.

Since we don't have specific values for `pos1`, `posn`, or `n`, we can summarize the output state based on the conditions provided:

- The output state will maintain the conditions regarding `n`, `a`, `pos1`, and `posn`, and we will specifically update `max_dist` to reflect its calculated value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers derived from input, containing `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the integer 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of the integer `n` in list `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
