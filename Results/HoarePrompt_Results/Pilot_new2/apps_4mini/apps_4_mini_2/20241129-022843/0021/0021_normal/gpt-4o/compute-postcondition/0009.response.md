Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`; `max_distance` is equal to `max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)`; `max_distance` is printed.**
