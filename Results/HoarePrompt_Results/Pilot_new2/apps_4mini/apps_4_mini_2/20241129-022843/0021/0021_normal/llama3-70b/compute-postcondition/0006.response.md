The code prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The definitions of `max_dist` and `min_dist` remain unchanged, but we will use their current values to determine the output.

- `max_dist` is defined as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`
- `min_dist` is defined as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`

The calculation for the printed value is `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`. This means we need to evaluate both `max_dist` and `min_dist` according to their definitions and then compute the final output.

The values of `n`, `pos1`, and `posn` determine the specific numeric values for `max_dist` and `min_dist`, but these calculations aren't explicitly detailed in the prompt.

Thus, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers containing `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the integer 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of the integer n in list `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is equal to `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); the output is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist) which is printed.**
