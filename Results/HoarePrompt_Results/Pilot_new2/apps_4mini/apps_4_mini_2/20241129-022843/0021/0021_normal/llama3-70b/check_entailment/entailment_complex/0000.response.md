To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and how it relates to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The program takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct integers from `1` to `n`.
2. The goal is to maximize the distance between the minimum element (`1`) and the maximum element (`n`) by performing exactly one swap in the list.
3. The output is a single integer representing the maximum possible distance after one swap.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos1 = a.index(1)  # Position of minimum element (1)
    posn = a.index(n)  # Position of maximum element (n)
    max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)  # Calculate maximum distance
    min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)  # Calculate minimum distance
    print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))  # Print result
```

#### Breakdown of the Code's Logic:
- The program correctly identifies the positions of `1` and `n`.
- It calculates the current distance between `1` and `n` using `abs(pos1 - posn)`.
- The calculation of `max_dist` and `min_dist` seems to be attempting to determine the best achievable distance after a swap.

#### Issues Identified:
1. The formula `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` doesnâ€™t directly relate to maximizing the distance through a swap. Instead, it seems to calculate a distance based on the current positions, but does not accurately check all possible swaps to find the maximum distance.
2. The concept of `n - 2` and how it factors into determining the maximum and minimum distances is unclear and does not align with the problem's requirements. The problem states that we need to actually swap elements to maximize the distance, which this logic does not ensure.

### Conclusion:
The actual logic implemented in the function does not optimally determine the maximum distance achievable through a single swap. It fails to account for the fact that simply adjusting the current positions without considering the actual array structure does not guarantee finding the true maximum distance.

Based on this analysis, the program does not adhere to the problem description as it does not ensure that the swap will maximize the distance between `1` and `n`.

Correctness: **False**
