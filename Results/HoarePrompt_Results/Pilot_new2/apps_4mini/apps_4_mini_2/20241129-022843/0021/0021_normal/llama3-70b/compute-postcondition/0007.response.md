The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. After executing the function body, it processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the provided constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \)) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range 1 to `n`).**
