To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic and see if it accurately implements what the problem description states about maximizing the distance between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in a permutation by performing exactly one swap.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads an integer `n` (which represents the size of the permutation) and a list of distinct integers `a` that forms the permutation.

2. **Finding Positions**: 
   - The code computes `pos1`, the position of the minimum element (1).
   - It also computes `posn`, the position of the maximum element (n).

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The code calculates `max_dist` using `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`. 
   - It calculates `min_dist` using `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
   - Finally, it prints `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`.

### Problem in the Code

The main issue with the code lies in the calculation of `max_dist` and `min_dist`. The code appears to be incorrectly calculating the distances available for a swap without correctly considering the actual swapping mechanics and the goal of maximizing the distance.

For example, consider the case where:
- Input: `n = 4`, and the permutation is `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The positions would be `pos1 = 3` (for 1) and `posn = 0` (for 4).
- The distance `abs(3 - 0) = 3`, but after swapping `4` and `1`, we might still have the positions close together. The logic does not ensure that after one swap, the distance is maximized.

### Test Example Where It Fails

Let's consider a case where the code may not yield the correct result:
- Input: 
```
4
4 1 3 2
```
- Expected output after a swap should be `2` (after swapping `4` and `2`, positions of `1` and `2` will be `1` and `3` respectively).
- However, the code would calculate based on its logic and may yield an incorrect distance.

### Conclusion

Given that the program has a flaw in its logic for calculating the maximum distance after a swap, and considering the test case provided above where the output does not meet expectations, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
