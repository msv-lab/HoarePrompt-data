To determine the output state, we analyze the provided initial condition and code snippet.

1. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. The value of `chosen_route` remains unchanged.
2. The variable `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions provided, specifically using `s_i` (an element from `bus_routes`) and `d_i` (another element from `bus_routes`).
3. The line of code `min_wait_time = wait_time` means that the value of `wait_time` is assigned to the variable `min_wait_time`.

Since we don't have specific values for `s_i` and `d_i`, we can state that:

- `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions involving `s_i` and `d_i`.
- The resulting value of `min_wait_time` will be equal to whatever `wait_time` has been calculated to be based on those conditions.

Therefore, the output state should reflect the fact that `min_wait_time` has been set to `wait_time`, but without specific values for `wait_time` since `s_i` and `d_i` are not defined:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` remains unchanged, `min_wait_time` equals `wait_time`.**
