The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. However, the value of `i` is not provided explicitly, so while `chosen_route` depends on `i`, we can't specify its exact value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` is equal to `i + 1`.**
