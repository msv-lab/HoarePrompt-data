The `wait_time` variable is initialized to 0. The previous states of the variables `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `wait_time` has been set to 0 while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` remains unchanged, `i` is now greater than or equal to 1, and `s_i, d_i` is assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is 0**.
