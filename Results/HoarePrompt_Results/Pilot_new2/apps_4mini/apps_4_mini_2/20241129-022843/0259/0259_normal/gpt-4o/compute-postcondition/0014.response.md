The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The initial state indicates that `min_wait_time` was `float('inf')`, and that the calculated `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`. Therefore, after the assignment, `min_wait_time` will now hold the value of `wait_time`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`, and the calculated `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`.**
