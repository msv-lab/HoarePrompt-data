Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, and `chosen_route` remains unchanged. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. Otherwise, if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.***
