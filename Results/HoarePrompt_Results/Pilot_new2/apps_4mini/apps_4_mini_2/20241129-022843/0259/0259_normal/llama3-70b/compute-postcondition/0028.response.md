`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so `ans` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2, `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`, `time` is now equal to `(t - s) % d`, `min_time` is equal to `time`, `ans` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2, `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`, `time` is now equal to `(t - s) % d`, `min_time` is equal to `time`, `ans` is 3.**
