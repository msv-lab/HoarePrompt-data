The variables `s` and `d` are assigned the values returned from `input()`, which are split into two parts and converted to integers. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged. The specific values of `s` and `d` will depend on what is inputted, but they are guaranteed to be integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an integer from input, `d` is an integer from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an integer from input, `d` is an integer from input.**
