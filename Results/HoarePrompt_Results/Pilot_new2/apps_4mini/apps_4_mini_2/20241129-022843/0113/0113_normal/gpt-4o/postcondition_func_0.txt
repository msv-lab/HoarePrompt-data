The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), and returns the value of `n` multiplied by (10^k divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and 10^k). The function does not handle cases where `n` or `k` are out of the specified bounds, but within the bounds, it correctly computes the result based on the provided formula.
