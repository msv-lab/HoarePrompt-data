#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is equal to n multiplied by (multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of n and multiplier), where multiplier is 10 raised to the power of k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), and returns the value of `n` multiplied by (10^k divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and 10^k). The function does not handle cases where `n` or `k` are out of the specified bounds, but within the bounds, it correctly computes the result based on the provided formula.
