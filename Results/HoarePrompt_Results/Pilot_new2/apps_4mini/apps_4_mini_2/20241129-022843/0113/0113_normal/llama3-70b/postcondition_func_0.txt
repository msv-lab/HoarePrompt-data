The function accepts no parameters directly but reads two integers from input: a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It finds the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` that is divisible by \(10^k\) and prints that integer. If `n` is already divisible by \(10^k\), it remains unchanged.
