The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. After executing the function body, if `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the `ones` list. If `n` is in the range of 11 to 19, the function returns the string representation corresponding to the `teens` list based on `n - 10`. If `n` is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99, the function returns the string corresponding to the tens place from the `tens` list. Finally, if `n` is between 10 and 99 (but not a multiple of 10), the function returns the English word representation of `n` by concatenating the appropriate value from the `tens` list for the ten's place and the value from the `ones` list for the unit's place, separated by a hyphen. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns its string representation based on its value: if n is between 0 and 9, it returns the string from the 'ones' list; if n is between 11 and 19, it returns the string from the 'teens' list; if n is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99, it returns the string from the 'tens' list; and if n is between 10 and 99 (not a multiple of 10), it returns the concatenated string from the 'tens' and 'ones' lists.**
