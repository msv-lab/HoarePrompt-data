Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case for numbers between 10 and 19, specifically for the number 10. According to the problem description, the output for the score of 10 should be "ten". However, the current implementation does not account for the number 10 properly because it only checks for numbers from 11 to 19 in the `teens` list. Thus, it will return an empty string for the input of 10, which is incorrect.

For example:
- Input: `10`
- Expected Output: `ten`
- Actual Output: `''` (empty string)

This shows the program does not work as expected for the input of 10, confirming that the code is incorrect.
