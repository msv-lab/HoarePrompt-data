To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` against the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Breakdown of the Function

1. **Input Range**: The function accepts an integer `n` and we know `0 ≤ n ≤ 99` based on the problem description.

2. **Arrays Used**:
   - `ones`: Covers numbers from 0 to 9.
   - `teens`: Covers numbers from 11 to 19.
   - `tens`: Covers multiples of ten from 10 to 90.

3. **Logic**:
   - If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
   - If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list.
   - If `n` is between 10 and 99:
     - If `n` is a multiple of 10 (e.g., 10, 20, ..., 90), it returns the corresponding word from the `tens` list.
     - Otherwise, it combines the word for the tens place (from `tens`) and the word for the ones place (from `ones`) with a hyphen in between.

### Edge Cases
- The code does not handle the case when `n` is `10` directly since it falls into the category of multiples of ten, but it correctly returns "ten".
- However, it does not explicitly check for `0` as a case in the ranges but correctly returns "zero".

### Testing Additional Edge Cases
- **Input: 0** -> Output should be "zero". The function handles this correctly.
- **Input: 10** -> Output should be "ten". The function handles this correctly.
- **Input: 11** -> Output should be "eleven". The function handles this correctly.
- **Input: 19** -> Output should be "nineteen". The function handles this correctly.
- **Input: 20** -> Output should be "twenty". The function handles this correctly.
- **Input: 99** -> Output should be "ninety-nine". The function handles this correctly.

### Conclusion
The implementation correctly covers all cases as specified in the problem description, handling numbers from `0` to `99` correctly and covering all possible edge cases. 

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
