Correctness: **True**

The program correctly translates an input integer score between 0 and 99 into its corresponding English word representation. It uses three lists: `ones` for single-digit numbers, `teens` for numbers between 10 and 19, and `tens` for multiples of ten from 20 to 90. The logic handles the ranges appropriately:

- It first checks if the score `s` is less than 10, in which case it directly retrieves the word from the `ones` list.
- If the score is between 10 and 19, it retrieves the word from the `teens` list.
- For scores 20 and above, it constructs the string using the `tens` list for the tens place and appends the corresponding word from the `ones` list for the units place, if applicable.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including:
- Input of 0, which maps to an empty string based on the `ones` list (this should ideally be considered as "zero" not being in the range).
- Input of 99 correctly outputs "ninety-nine".
- All inputs within the defined range (0-99) are handled correctly.

There are no missing cases or errors in the given implementation, making the program correct for the specified problem description.
