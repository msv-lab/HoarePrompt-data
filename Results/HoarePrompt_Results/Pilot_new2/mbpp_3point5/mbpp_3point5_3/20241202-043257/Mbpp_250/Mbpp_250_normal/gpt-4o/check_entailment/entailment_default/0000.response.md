Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, then returns the number of times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`. The code handles this logic correctly for all potential cases and there are no edge cases where it fails. The output hints also align with the code and do not indicate any discrepancies.
