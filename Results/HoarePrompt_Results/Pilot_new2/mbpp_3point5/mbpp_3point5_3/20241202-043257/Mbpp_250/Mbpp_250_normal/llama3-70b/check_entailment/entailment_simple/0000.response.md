Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`. It then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup`. This exactly matches the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that counts the occurrences of a specific element in a given tuple.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description asks for.
