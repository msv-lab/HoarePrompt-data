Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not remove lowercase substrings from the given string as required by the problem description. Instead, it only retains uppercase characters in the string. This means that for input strings containing lowercase characters, the program will not produce the expected output. For example, if we input 'PYTHon', the expected output should be 'PYTH', but the program will output 'PYTHon'. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description.
