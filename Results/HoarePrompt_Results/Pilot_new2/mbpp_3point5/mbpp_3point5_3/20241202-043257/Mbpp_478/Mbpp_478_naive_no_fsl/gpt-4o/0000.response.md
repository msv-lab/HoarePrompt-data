Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it only removes lowercase characters from the string, but it should be removing the entire lowercase substrings. For example, for the input 'PYTHon', the output should be 'PYTH' instead of 'PYTH'. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
