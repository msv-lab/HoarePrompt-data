Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function that correctly returns the maximum of two numbers using the `max()` function, which is a valid and efficient approach to solving the problem. The function should work correctly for all potential cases where it is given two numerical inputs. Therefore, based on the problem description and the implementation provided, the program is correct.
