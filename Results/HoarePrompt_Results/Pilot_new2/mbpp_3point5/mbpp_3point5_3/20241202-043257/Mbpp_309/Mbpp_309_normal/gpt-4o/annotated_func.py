#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.**
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a > b else b
    #The program returns the greater value between 'a' and 'b', where 'a' and 'b' are integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters a and b, and returns the greater value between them.
