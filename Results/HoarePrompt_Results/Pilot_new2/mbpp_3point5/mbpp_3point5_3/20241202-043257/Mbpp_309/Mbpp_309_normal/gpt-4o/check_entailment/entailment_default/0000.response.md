Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple function that accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greater value between them using a ternary operator. The function directly aligns with the problem description of finding the maximum of two numbers. The code includes assertions to test the function with different inputs, and all the provided test cases pass successfully. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code and further confirm that the function operates as expected, returning the greater value between the two input numbers. Since the code aligns with the problem description and all the examples work correctly, the correctness of the code is **True**.
