Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns the greater value between `a` and `b` by using a conditional statement to compare the two integers. It follows the problem description of finding the maximum of two numbers. Since the program always returns the correct maximum value, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
