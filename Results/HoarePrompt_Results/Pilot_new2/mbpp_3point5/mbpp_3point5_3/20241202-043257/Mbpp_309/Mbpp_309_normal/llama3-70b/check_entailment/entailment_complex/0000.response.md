Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the maximum value between them using the built-in `max` function. This exactly matches the problem description which asks for a Python function to find the maximum of two numbers. Therefore, the program is correct as it does what is required by the problem description for every potential case.
