Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a number as input and returns the polar coordinates of the complex number formed by the input number. The program uses the `cmath.polar` function to convert the complex number to polar coordinates. The assertions check for different input values and their corresponding expected output polar coordinates. Since the program is handling the conversion correctly for all the provided test cases, we can conclude that it is correct.
