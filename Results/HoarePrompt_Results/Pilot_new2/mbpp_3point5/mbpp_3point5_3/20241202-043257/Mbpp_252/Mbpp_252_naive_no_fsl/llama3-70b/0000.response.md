Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates by using the `abs()` function to calculate the magnitude (r) of the complex number and the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the phase (theta) of the complex number. This logic works for all potential cases of complex numbers, making the program correct.
