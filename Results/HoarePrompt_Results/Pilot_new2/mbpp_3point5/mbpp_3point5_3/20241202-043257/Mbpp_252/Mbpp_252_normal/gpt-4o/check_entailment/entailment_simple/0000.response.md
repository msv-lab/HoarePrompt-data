Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number as input and uses the `cmath.polar` function to convert the complex number to polar coordinates. This aligns with the problem description which requires the function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
