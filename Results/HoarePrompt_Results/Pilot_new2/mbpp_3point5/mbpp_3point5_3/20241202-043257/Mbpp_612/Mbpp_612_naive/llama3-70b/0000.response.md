Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element. The program achieves this by using list comprehension to extract the first and second elements from each sublist. 

There are no edge cases or potential inputs mentioned in the problem description that the program would fail to handle. The program is straightforward and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
