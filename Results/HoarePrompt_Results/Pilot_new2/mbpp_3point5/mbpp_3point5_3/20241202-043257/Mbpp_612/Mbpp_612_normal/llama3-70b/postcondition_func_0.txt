The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. It then returns two lists. The first list contains the first element of each sublist in list_of_lists, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist in list_of_lists. The function correctly extracts and returns the elements as described in the annotations.
