Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements. It then correctly extracts the first and second elements of each sublist and returns them as separate lists. The program follows the problem description accurately and will work for all cases where the input list of lists contains exactly two elements in each sublist.
