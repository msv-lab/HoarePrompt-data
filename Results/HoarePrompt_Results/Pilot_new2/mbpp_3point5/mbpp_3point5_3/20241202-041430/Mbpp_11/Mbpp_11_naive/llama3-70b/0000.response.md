Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always remove the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. Specifically, when the first and last occurrence of the character are the same position, the program will not remove that character as intended. 

For example:
- Input: s = "abcabc", c = "a"
  Expected output: "bcabc"
  Actual output: "bcabc" (The program works correctly in this case)

- Input: s = "abcb", c = "b"
  Expected output: "c"
  Actual output: "cbc" (The program does not remove the first and last occurrence of 'b' correctly in this case)
