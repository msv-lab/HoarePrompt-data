Correctness: **False**

In the given program, the logic to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string is incorrect. The issue lies in the slicing of the string where the character at the `first_index` is included in the final result, which is not what the problem description requires. This means that the code does not handle the case where the first and last occurrence of the character are the same correctly.

For example:
- `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'` instead of `'heo'` as the first and last occurrence of 'l' are the same.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
