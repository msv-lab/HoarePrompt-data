The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `c`. Parameter `s` is a string and parameter `c` is a character. 

Case_1: The function returns the string `s` with the characters at the indices of first_occurrence and last_occurrence of character `c` removed.

Case_2: If the character `c` is not found in the string `s`, the function simply returns the original string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, and then return the string `s` with the characters at the index of first_occ and last_occ removed, or return the original string `s` if the character `c` is not found in the string.
