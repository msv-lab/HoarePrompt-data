Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It first finds the index of the first and last occurrences of the given character in the string. If the character is not found or if the first and last occurrences are the same, it returns the original string. Otherwise, it removes the characters at the first and last occurrences of the character and returns the modified string. This logic ensures that the program removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string.
