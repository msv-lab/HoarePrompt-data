Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the problem description. While it correctly removes the first occurrence of the character `c`, it fails to properly remove the last occurrence. The line `s[first_occ + 1:last_occ]` should actually be `s[first_occ + 1:last_occ - 1]` in order to remove the last occurrence as well. As a result, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for, specifically in cases where the character `c` appears more than once in the string `s`.
