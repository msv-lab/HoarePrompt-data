The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists of the same length containing numerical elements. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2` containing numerical elements of the same length and return a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists `list1` and `list2` containing numerical elements of the same length and returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`.**
