Correctness: **True**

The program checks if the lengths of both input lists are the same and raises a ValueError if they are not. Then it divides the elements of the two lists element-wise using list comprehension and zip function. This approach covers all potential cases, ensuring that the division is done only when the lists have the same length, as per the problem description.
