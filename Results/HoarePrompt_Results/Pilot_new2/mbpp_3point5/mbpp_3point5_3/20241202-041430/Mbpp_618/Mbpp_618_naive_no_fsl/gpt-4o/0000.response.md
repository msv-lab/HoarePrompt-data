Correctness: **True**

The program takes two lists as input and divides each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list. The program uses list comprehension along with the `zip()` function to achieve this. The provided test cases cover various scenarios such as dividing positive integers, dividing integers resulting in floating-point numbers, and dividing larger integers. In each case, the program produces the correct output as expected. Since all test cases pass and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as described, the code is considered correct.
