Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and divides the elements of the first list by the corresponding elements of the second list. The program uses list comprehension along with the `zip` function to iterate through the two lists simultaneously and perform element-wise division. The provided test cases cover a variety of scenarios and the output matches the expected results. Since the function correctly implements the division of two lists element-wise for all the provided test cases, the correctness is True.
