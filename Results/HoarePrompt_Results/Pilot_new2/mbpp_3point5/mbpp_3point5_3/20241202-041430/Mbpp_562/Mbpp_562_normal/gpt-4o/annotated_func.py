#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_length = 0
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        if len(sublist) > max_length:
            max_length = len(sublist)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: list_of_lists is a list of lists, max_length is the length of the longest sublist in list_of_lists, sublist is the last sublist in list_of_lists
    return max_length
    #The program returns the length of the longest sublist in list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists. It then iterates over the sublists to find the length of the longest sublist and returns that length. If the input list_of_lists is empty, the function will return 0 as there are no sublists to check.
