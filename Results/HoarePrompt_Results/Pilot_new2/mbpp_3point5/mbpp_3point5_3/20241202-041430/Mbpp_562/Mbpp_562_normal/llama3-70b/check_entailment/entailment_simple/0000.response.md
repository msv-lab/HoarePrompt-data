Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input. It then uses a generator expression to iterate over each sublist in the input list and calculates the length of each sublist. Finally, it returns the maximum length of these sublists.

This program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the input list of lists, as required by the problem description. It does this by using the `max()` function along with a generator expression to efficiently determine the maximum length. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
