Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the input list of lists. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each sublist and calculate its length, then returns the maximum length found. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle correctly. Hence, the program is correct.
