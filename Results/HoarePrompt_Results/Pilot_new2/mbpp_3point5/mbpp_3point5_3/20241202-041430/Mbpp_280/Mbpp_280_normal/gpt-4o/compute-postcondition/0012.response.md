The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `arr` and `element`. The parameter `arr` is a list, and the parameter `element` is any data type that can be compared with the elements in `arr`. 

After executing the function body, the program checks if the `element` exists in the `arr`. If it does, the program returns True along with the index value where the `element` is found. There are multiple cases with different index values returned: 
- Case 1: The program returns True and the index value where the `element` is found.
- Case 2: The program returns True and the index value 1.
- Case 3: The program returns True and the index value 2.

If the loop does not execute or the `element` is not found in the `arr`, the program returns False and -1 as the index value, as `arr` is a list, `index` is not defined, and `value` is not defined.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `element`, and return True along with the index value where the element is found in the list. If the element is not found, it returns False and -1.
