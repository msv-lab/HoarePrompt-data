Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and a data `elem`. It then iterates through the list to find the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is found, the function returns True along with the index of `elem` in the list. If `elem` is not found, the function returns False along with -1. The functionality description provided in the annotations covers the cases where `elem` is found at different positions in the list, but it doesn't cover the case where the list `arr` is empty. In that case, the function will always return False and -1. **
