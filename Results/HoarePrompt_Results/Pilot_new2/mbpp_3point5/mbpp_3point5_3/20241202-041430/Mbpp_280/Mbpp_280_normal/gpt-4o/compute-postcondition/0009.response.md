Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `index` is 2, and `value` is the third element in the list. The value is not equal to `element`. If `value` is equal to `element`, the function returns True and sets the index variable to 2. Otherwise, if `value` is not equal to `element`, the program does not change the state of `arr`, `index`, or `value`.***
