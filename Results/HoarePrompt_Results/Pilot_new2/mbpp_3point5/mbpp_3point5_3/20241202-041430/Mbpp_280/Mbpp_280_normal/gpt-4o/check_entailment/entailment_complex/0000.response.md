Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function according to the problem description. It takes in an array `arr` and an element `element`, iterates through the array to find if the element exists in the array, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if not found).

The program handles the cases where the element is found, not found, and even when the loop does not execute. It returns True and the index if the element is found, and False and -1 if the element is not found. The annotations also explain the state of the program before and after the loop, providing clarity on the functionality of the code.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
