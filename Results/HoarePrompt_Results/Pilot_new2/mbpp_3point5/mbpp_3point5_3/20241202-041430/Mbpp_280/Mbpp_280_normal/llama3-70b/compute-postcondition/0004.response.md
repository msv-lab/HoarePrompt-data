According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 1 element, elem is any data type, i is 0, x is the first element in the list, and x is not equal to elem. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 elements, i must be 1, x must be the second element in the list, and x must still not be equal to elem.
State: **arr is a list that must have at least 2 elements, elem is any data type, i is 1, x is the second element in the list. x is not equal to elem**
