Correctness: True

Explanation: The function iterates through the array using enumerate and checks if the current element is equal to the target element. If a match is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index of the element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The provided test cases cover different scenarios where the target element is present in different positions within the array, and the function returns the correct results for all cases. Hence, the function is correct.
