#State of the program right berfore the function call: binary_str is a string representing a binary number, and num_rotations is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(binary_str, num_rotations):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `binary_str` is the result of shifting the binary number `num_rotations` positions to the right. `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. `count` is the number of times the decimal conversion of each shifted `binary_str` resulted in an odd number.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of times the decimal conversion of each shifted binary string resulted in an odd number
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str`, a string representing a binary number, and `num_rotations`, a non-negative integer. It then shifts the binary string to the right based on the `num_rotations` value, calculates the decimal value of each shifted string, and counts the number of times the result is an odd number. Finally, the function returns the count of odd decimal values.
