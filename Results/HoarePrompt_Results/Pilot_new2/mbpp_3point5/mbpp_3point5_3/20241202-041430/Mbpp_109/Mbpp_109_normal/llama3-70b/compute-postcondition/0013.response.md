The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `n`. `s` is a binary string, and `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the program returns the total count of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `len(s)` modulo 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the total count of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `len(s)` modulo 2. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string s and a non-negative integer n, returns the total count of '1's in all substrings of s of length len(s) modulo 2.**
