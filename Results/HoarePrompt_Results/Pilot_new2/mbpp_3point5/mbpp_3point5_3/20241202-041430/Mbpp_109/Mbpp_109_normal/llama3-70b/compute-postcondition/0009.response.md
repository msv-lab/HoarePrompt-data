Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `count` is updated to its previous value plus the count of '1's in the substring of `s` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `i + len(s)+1` modulo 2, `n` is greater than the new value of `i+1` + 1, `temp` is the substring of `s` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `i + len(s)+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `temp` is the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + len(s)`**
