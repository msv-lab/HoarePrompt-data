The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str`, which is a string representing a binary number, and `num_rotations`, which is a non-negative integer. The function returns the number of times the decimal conversion of each shifted binary string resulted in an odd number. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string and a non-negative integer representing the number of rotations, and then return the count of times the decimal conversion of each shifted binary string results in an odd number.
