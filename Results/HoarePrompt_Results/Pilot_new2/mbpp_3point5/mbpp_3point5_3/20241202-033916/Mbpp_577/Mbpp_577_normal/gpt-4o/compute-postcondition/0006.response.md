According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and less than 5, `factorial` is equal to `i`, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should still be greater than 0 and less than 5, `factorial` should be equal to `i+1`, and `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0 and less than 5, `factorial` is equal to `i+1`, `i` is 2**
