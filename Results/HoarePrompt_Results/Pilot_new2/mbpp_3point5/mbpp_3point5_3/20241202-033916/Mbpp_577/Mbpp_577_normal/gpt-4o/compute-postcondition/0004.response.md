According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. The loop will run from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `factorial` variable is set to 1 initially. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, `factorial` remains 1, and `i` starts at 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0 and less than 5, `factorial` is 1, `i` is 1**
