Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program provided does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that finds the last digit in the factorial of a given number, but the provided function `func_1` does not calculate the factorial of the input number `n`. Instead, it returns different values based on specific conditions related to the input number `n` itself.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
