Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. 
For example, when calling `func_1(21)`, the expected output is 0 because the last digit of 21! is 0. However, the program will return 1 instead of 0. This is because the condition `if n >= 5:` is incorrect since it should be checking if `n >= 10` to handle factorials that result in a last digit of 0. Since the program fails for this case, the correctness is false.
