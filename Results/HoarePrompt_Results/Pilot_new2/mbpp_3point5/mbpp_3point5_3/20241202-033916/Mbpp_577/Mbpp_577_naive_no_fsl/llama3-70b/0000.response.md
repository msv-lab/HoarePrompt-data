Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The program simply returns 0 for all input values larger than 4, which is incorrect. The correct approach to finding the last digit in the factorial of a number involves calculating the factorial and then extracting the last digit. Here is an example of why the program is incorrect:

Example:
Input: 5
Expected Output: 0
Actual Output: 0

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
