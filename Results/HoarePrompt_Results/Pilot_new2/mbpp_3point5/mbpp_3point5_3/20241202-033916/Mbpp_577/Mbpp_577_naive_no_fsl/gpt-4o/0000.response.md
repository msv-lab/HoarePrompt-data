Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly find the last digit of the factorial of a given number. The condition `if n >= 5:` will always return 0 regardless of the number provided, which is incorrect. The logic used in the program is incorrect and does not match the problem description. 

For example, if we test the program with `func_1(5)`, the expected output should be `0` (since the last digit of 5! is 0), but the program will return `0` for all inputs greater than or equal to 5. 

Therefore, the program is not correct.
