Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input and returns a new list by concatenating the elements of the tuple to the list. The program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function converts the tuple to a list using `list(tup)` and then concatenates it with the original list `lst` using the `+` operator, which is the desired behavior as per the problem description. Additionally, the function does not exhibit any logical errors or missing edge cases, hence it is correct.
