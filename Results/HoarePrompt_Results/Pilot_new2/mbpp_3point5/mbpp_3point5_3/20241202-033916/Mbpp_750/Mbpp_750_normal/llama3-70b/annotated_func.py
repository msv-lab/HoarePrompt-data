#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tup is a tuple.**
def func_1(lst, tup):
    return lst + list(tup)
    #The program returns the concatenation of list 'lst' and the elements of tuple 'tup' as a list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and concatenates `lst` with the elements of `tup` as a new list.
