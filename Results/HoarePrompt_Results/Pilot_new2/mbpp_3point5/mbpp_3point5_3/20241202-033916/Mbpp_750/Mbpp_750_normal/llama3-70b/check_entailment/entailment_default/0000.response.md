Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in the program accurately follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and concatenates `lst` with the elements of `tup` to create a new list. This functionality is correctly implemented in the code and there are no edge cases identified where the code does not behave as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the code is true.
