Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks whether the cost_price is equal to the selling_price, which indicates that there is no profit or loss. This aligns with the problem description of checking for no profit and no loss. The program returns True only when the cost_price and selling_price are equal, satisfying the requirements of the problem description.
