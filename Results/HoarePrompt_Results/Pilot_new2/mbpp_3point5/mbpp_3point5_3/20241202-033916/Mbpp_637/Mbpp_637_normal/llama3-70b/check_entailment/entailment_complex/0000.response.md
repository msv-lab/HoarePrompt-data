Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two non-negative integers `cost_price` and `selling_price` and returns True if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, and False otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss, which means the cost price should be equal to the selling price. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
