Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. The provided test cases cover all potential scenarios - when there is no profit, no loss, and when there is either profit or loss. The function returns `True` only when the cost price is equal to the selling price, which aligns with the problem description.
