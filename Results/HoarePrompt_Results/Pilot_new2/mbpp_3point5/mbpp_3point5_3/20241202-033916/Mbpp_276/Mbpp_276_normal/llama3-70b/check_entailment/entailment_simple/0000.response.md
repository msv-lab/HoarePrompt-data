Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, as per the problem description. The function takes in the radius and height of the cylinder as input and returns the volume, which aligns with the requirements stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
