The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, the program returns the volume calculated by multiplying `math.pi` with the value of `radius`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the volume calculated using the formula `math.pi * radius`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume calculated by multiplying `math.pi` with the value of `radius`.**
