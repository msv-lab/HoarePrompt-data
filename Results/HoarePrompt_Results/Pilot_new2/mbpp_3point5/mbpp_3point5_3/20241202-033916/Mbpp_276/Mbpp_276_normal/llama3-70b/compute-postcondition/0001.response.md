The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative numbers. The function calculates the result by multiplying the square of the radius and height with the value of `math.pi`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the result of `math.pi` multiplied by the square of `radius` and `height`.
Functionality: **The function accepts non-negative numbers radius and height, and returns the result of math.pi multiplied by the square of radius and height.**
