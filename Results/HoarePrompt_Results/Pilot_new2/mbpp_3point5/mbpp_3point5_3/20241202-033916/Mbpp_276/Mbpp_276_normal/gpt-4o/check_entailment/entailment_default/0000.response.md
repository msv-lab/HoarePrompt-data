Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `volume = math.pi * radius^2 * height`. The function takes in the radius and height as non-negative numbers and returns the calculated volume. The code also includes assertions to validate the function with multiple test cases, and all the assertions pass, confirming that the function works as intended. The output hints correctly describe the functionality of the code, further confirming its correctness.
