Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `is_prime`, where `func_1` calculates the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n`, and `is_prime` checks if a number is prime.

1. `is_prime` function correctly determines if a number is prime by checking divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is less than 2, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True if the number is not divisible by any number in the specified range.

2. `func_1` function correctly calculates the count of prime numbers less than the given number `n` by iterating through numbers from 2 to `n` and checking if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and returns the correct count of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
