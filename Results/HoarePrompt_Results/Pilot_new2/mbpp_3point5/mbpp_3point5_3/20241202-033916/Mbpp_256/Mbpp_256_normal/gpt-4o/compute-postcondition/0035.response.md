The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case 1: If the value of `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0.

Case 2: If `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, the function updates values where all multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n` have been marked as `False`, and then returns the sum of the `is_prime` values. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, and return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2, or the sum of `is_prime` values after updating based on prime number multiples up to the square root of `n`.
