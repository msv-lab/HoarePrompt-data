Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values except for `is_prime[0] = False` and `is_prime[1] = False`. After the loop finishes executing, `is_prime` will have updated values where all multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n` have been marked as `False`, effectively marking non-prime numbers.**
