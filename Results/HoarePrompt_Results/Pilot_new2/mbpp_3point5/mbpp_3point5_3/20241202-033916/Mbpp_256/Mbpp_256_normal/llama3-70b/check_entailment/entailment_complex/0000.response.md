Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not handle the case where the input number is 0 correctly. The `func_1` function should return 0 when the input number is 0 since there are no prime numbers less than 0, but the code does not account for this case. This inconsistency means that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
