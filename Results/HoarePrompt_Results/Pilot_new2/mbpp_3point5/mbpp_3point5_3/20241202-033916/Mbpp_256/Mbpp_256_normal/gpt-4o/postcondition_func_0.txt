The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. For `n` greater than 2, the function updates values in a list `is_prime` where multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n` are marked as `False`, and then returns the sum of the `is_prime` values.
