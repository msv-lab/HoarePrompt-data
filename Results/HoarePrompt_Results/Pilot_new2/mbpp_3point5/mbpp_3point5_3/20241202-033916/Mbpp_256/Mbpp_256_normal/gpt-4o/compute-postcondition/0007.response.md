According to the code, the loop can execute if the range `i * i` to `n` is valid. The loop condition `j < n` implies `n` must be greater than `i * i`. To ensure the loop executes, the states must be adjusted so that the range is valid. Also, the loop body requires that `is_prime[i]` is True after the loop iteration, meaning `i` should refer to a prime number. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than `i * i`, and `is_prime[i]` is True.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False`, i is 2, `n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime[i]` is True**.
