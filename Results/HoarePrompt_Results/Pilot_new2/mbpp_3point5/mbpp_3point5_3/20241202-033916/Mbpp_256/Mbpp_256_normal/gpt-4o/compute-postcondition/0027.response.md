According to the code, the loop will execute again if j is less than n. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `i` is 4, `j` is 16, `is_prime[j] = False`. So for the loop to execute one more time, j should be incremented by i and be less than n. Since i is 4, the next j value should be 20.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values except for `is_prime[0] = False` and `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, `is_prime[j] = False**
