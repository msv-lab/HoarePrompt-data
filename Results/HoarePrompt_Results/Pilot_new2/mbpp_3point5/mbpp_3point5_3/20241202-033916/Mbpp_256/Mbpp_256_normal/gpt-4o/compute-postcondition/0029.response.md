According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[j]` is False. Since the loop is iterating over multiples of `i`, the next iteration will involve updating `j` to the next multiple of `i`. 

To find the next multiple of `i` after 20, we need to increment `j` by `i`, which is 4. Therefore, the next multiple of 4 after 20 is 24. So for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values except for `is_prime[0] = False` and `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime[j] = False**.
