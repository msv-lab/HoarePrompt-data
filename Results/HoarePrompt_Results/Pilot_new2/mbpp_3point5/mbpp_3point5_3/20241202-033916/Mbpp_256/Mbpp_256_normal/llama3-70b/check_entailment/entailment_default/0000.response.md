# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n: int) -> int:

    count = 0
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return count
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts a non-negative integer n and calculates the number of prime numbers between 2 and n (inclusive). It iterates through the range from 2 to n, checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function, and increments a count for each prime number found. The function then returns the count of prime numbers.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

''' 

 Output decription for function2:  Functionality: The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer parameter `num` and determines if it is a prime number. It returns False if `num` is less than 2 or if it is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num`. If the loop does not execute, the function returns True, indicating that `num` is a non-negative prime number. The missing functionality in the annotations is handling the case where `num` is 2, which should return True since 2 is a prime number.

# Initial Assessment:
The code seems to be following the problem description by calculating the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number 'n'. The functions are named properly and the logic seems correct. However, it's important to check if the code handles all potential edge cases and if the output hints align with the code.

# Checking with Output Hints:
- The `is_prime` function correctly checks if a number is prime by iterating up to the square root of the number.
- The main function `func_1` iterates from 2 to 'n' and counts the number of prime numbers correctly.

# Final Assessment:
The code seems to be correct as it calculates the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number 'n' as described. The output hints also align with the code logic and there are no edge cases identified where the code does not follow the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
