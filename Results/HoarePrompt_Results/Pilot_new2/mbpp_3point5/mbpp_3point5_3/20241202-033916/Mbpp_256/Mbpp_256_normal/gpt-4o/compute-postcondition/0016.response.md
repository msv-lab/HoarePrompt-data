According to the code, the loop can execute if `i * i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is 3, `i * i` is 9 which is less than `n`. Therefore, the loop can execute based on this condition. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 9**
