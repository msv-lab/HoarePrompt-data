Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function iterates through the input tuple and checks if any item is equal to `None`. If it finds a `None` value, it returns `True`, indicating that the tuple has a `None` value. If no `None` value is found, it returns `False`. The provided test cases cover scenarios where there is a `None` value in the tuple and where there is no `None` value, confirming that the function works correctly as described.
