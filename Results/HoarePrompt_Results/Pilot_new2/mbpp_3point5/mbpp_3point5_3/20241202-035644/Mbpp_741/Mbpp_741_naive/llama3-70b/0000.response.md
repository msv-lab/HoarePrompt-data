Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and uses `set(s)` to get all unique characters in the string. Then it checks if the length of the set is equal to 1, which means all characters in the string are the same. This logic works correctly for all cases as even if the string is empty or has only one character, the set will have a length of 1 and the function will return `True`. Also, if the string has multiple characters but they are all the same, the set will have a length of 1 and the function will return `True`. Hence, the program meets the requirements of checking whether all characters are the same or not.
