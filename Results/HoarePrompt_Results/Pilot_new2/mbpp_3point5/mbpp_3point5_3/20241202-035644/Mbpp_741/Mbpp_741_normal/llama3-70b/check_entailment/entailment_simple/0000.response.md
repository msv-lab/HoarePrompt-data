Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function called `func_1` which takes a string `s` as input. It then checks if the length of the set of characters in the string is equal to 1. If the length is 1, it means that all characters in the string are the same, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

This implementation correctly checks whether all characters in the string are the same or not, as stated in the problem description. Since it uses the set data structure to remove duplicates and then checks if the length of the set is 1, it effectively determines if all characters are the same. Therefore, the program is correct.
