According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the string `s` is not empty. Since `s` is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is not empty guarantees that the loop will execute. However, to be more specific, we need to adjust the state to specify that `char` is the first character of the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a string containing characters and it is not empty, `first_char` is the first character of the string `s`, `char` is the first character of the string `s`**
