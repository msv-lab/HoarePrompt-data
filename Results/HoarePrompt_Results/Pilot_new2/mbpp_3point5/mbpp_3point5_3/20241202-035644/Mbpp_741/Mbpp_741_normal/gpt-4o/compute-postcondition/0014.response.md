Output State: **The loop will return False if there is a character in the string `s` that is different from the first character `first_char`. Otherwise, the loop will continue until the end of the string. In the end, `s` is a non-empty string containing characters, and all characters are equal to `first_char`, `first_char` remains the same.**
