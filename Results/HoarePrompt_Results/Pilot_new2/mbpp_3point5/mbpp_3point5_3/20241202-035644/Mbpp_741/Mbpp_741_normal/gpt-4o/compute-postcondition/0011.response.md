According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the loop will not execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string containing characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the next character in `s` after `first_char`. To execute the loop one more time, `char` must be equal to `first_char`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` must be equal to `first_char`**
