Correctness: **True**

The code provided for the function `func_1` aligns perfectly with the problem description. It correctly checks whether all characters in the input string are the same or not. The function returns True if the string is empty and False if any character in the string differs from the first character. If all characters in the string are equal to the first character, it returns True.

Additionally, the output hints also confirm the correctness of the code by stating the same logic as described in the problem description. Since the code covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and the examples given, we can conclude that the code is correct.
