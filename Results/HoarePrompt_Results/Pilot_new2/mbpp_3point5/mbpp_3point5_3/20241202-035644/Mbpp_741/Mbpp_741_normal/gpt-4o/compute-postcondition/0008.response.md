According to the code, the loop executes as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string containing characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is equal to `first_char`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the string `s` must still have characters left to iterate over. In this case, the next character in the string becomes `char` and should be equal to `first_char`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the next character in `s` after `first_char`, and `char` is equal to `first_char`**
