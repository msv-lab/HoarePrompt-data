Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element, but it does not consider the possibility of the list being sorted in descending order. The problem description states that the function should check whether a specified list is sorted or not, without specifying the sorting order. As a result, the program does not cover all potential cases where the list might be sorted in descending order.
