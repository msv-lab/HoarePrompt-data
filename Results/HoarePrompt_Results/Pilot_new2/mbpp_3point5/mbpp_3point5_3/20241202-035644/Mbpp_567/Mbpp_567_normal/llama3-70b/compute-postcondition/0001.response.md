The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements that can be sorted. After executing the function body, the program returns True if all elements in the list 'lst' are in non-descending order, meaning each element is less than or equal to the next element. If the elements are not in non-descending order, the function returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` of comparable elements and return True if the elements are in non-descending order, and False otherwise.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns True if all elements are in non-descending order. Otherwise, it returns False.**
