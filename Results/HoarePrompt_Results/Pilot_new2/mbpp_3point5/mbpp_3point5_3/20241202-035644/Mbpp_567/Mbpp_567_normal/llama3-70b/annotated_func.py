#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements (e.g., integers, strings) that can be sorted.**
def func_1(lst):
    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))
    #The program returns True if all elements in the list 'lst' are in non-descending order (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list of comparable elements and returns True if all elements in the list are in non-descending order (each element is less than or equal to the next element). Otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-comparable elements, such as objects of different types. It also does not check for the edge case where the list has only one element.
