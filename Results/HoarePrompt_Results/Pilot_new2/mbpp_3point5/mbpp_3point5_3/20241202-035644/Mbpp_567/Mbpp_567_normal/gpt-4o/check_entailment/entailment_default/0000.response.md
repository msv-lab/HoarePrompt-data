Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the list is empty as mentioned in the problem description. If an empty list is passed as input, the code will throw an "IndexError" since the loop will try to access the index `i + 1` when `i` is the last index (len(lst) - 1). This means that the code does not exactly follow the problem description for all potential cases.
