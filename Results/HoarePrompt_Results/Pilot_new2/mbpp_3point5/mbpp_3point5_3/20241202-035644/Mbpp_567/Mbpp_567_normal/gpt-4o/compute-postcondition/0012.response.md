The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. The function iterates through the list, and if the elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns True. If there is only one element in the list, the loop does not execute. If the loop executes and finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to check if the elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order and return True if they are, and False otherwise.
