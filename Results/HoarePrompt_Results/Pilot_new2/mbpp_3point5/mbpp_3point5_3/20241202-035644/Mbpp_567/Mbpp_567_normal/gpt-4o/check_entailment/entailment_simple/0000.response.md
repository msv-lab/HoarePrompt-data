Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It iterates through the list `lst` and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If it finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. This behavior aligns with the problem description of checking whether a specified list is sorted or not.
