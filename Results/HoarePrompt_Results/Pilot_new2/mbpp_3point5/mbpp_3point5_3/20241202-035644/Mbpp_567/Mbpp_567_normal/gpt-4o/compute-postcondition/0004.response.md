According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of at least 2 comparable elements, and `i` is 0. The element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1, and the condition `i < len(lst) - 1` should still hold true.
State: **`lst` is a list of at least 2 comparable elements, `i` is 1. The element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`**
