Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as input and checks whether the elements in the list are in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and returns False as soon as it finds a pair of elements that are out of order. If the loop completes without finding any such pairs, it returns True.

The program follows the problem description accurately as it correctly checks whether the list is sorted or not. It handles both the cases where there is only one element in the list (returns True without executing the loop) and where there are more than one elements in the list (checks for non-decreasing order). Overall, the program fulfills the requirements stated in the problem description.
