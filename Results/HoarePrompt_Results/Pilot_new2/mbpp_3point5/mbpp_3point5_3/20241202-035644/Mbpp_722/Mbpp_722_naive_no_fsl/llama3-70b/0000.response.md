Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the dictionary `student_data` and filters out students whose height and weight are above the provided minimum values `min_height` and `min_weight`. The program correctly creates a new dictionary with only the students who meet the criteria. There are no potential cases where the program would fail to filter out the students as required by the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
