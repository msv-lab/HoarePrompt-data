Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_data`, and two floats `min_height` and `min_weight`. It then filters the student data based on the criteria that the student's height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, returning a new dictionary with the filtered student information. This aligns perfectly with the problem description provided.

The program uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the `student_data` dictionary, checking if each student's height and weight meet the minimum requirements. If they do, the student's information is included in the new dictionary that is returned. This process ensures that only students with height and weight above the minimum values are included in the final output.
