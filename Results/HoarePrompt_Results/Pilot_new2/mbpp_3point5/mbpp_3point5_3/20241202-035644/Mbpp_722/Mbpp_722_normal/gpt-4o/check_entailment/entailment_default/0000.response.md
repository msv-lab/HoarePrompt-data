Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `student_dict`, and two floats `min_height` and `min_weight`, then filters the `student_dict` to include only students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.
- The code correctly filters out students based on the minimum height and weight requirements provided.
- The code uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the student dictionary and filter out students that do not meet the height and weight criteria.
- The code returns a new dictionary with the filtered students, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code handles the cases where `student_dict` is empty, ensuring that the function behaves correctly for different scenarios.
- The output hints also agree with the code and reinforce the fact that the program behaves as expected.
