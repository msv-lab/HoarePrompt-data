Example Answer:
The code calculates the number of even integers in the list `lst` and assigns it to the variable `even_count`. The previous value of `lst` is a list of integers. The output state is that even_count now contains the count of even integers in the list.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`**
