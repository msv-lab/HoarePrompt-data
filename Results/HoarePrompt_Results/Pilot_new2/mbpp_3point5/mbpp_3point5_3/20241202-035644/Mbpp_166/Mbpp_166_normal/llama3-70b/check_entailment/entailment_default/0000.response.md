Correctness: **False**

The problem description states that the function should count the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. However, the code provided counts the number of pairs where the XOR result is divisible by 2, which is not the same as being an even number. For example, the XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, which is not an even number, but the code would still count this pair. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Additionally, the output hints describe the same incorrect logic as the code, so they do not provide any valid cases to prove the correctness of the code.
