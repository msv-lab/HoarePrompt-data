The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. The program calculates the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs, where even_pairs is the product of the count of even integers in the list multiplied by count of even integers in the list minus 1 divided by 2, and odd_pairs is the product of the count of odd integers in the list multiplied by count of odd integers in the list minus 1 divided by 2. The function then returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs based on the count of even and odd integers in the list.**
