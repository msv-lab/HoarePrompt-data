Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.
- The function first counts the number of even integers and odd integers in the list.
- It then calculates the number of pairs that can be formed using even integers and odd integers separately using the formula (count * (count - 1)) // 2.
- Finally, it returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases provided.
