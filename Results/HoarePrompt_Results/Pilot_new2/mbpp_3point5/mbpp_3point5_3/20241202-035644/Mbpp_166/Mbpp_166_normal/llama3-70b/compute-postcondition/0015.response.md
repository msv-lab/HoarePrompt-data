Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is updated after each pair (i, j) where XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `i` is 1, `j` is the last index of `nums`. The XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number after entering the if condition `((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0)`***
