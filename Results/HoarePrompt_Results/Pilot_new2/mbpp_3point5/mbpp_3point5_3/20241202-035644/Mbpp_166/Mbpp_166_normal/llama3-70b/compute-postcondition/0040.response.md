Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a list of integers nums and calculates the total number of pairs (i, j) in the list nums where the bitwise XOR of nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number. The final values of i and j are the last two indices of nums.** 

The function iterates through all possible pairs of numbers in the input list nums and increments a counter if the XOR of the pair results in an even number. The function then returns the total count of such pairs. The code accurately reflects the annotations provided.
