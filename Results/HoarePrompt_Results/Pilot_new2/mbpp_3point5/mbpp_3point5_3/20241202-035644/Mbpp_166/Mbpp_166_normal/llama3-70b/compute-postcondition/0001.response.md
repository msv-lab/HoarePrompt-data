According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the nums list has at least one element. Before the loop starts, count is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, nums list must have at least one element, and i is 0.
State: **nums is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, count is 0, i is 0**
