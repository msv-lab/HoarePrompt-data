According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the length of `nums` is greater than `i + 1. Since the loop will iterate over the range from `i + 1` to the length of `nums`, the next value of `j` should be `j + 1`. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j+1]` results in an even number, the function will increase `count` by 2.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. `count` is 3. `i` is 0. `j` is 3. The length of `nums` is greater than `i + 1**.
