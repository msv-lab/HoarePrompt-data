According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and the length of `nums`. Since `nums` must have at least 1 element, the loop can execute if the length of `nums` is greater than `i + 1`. Before the loop starts, count is 0 and i is 0, so to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `j` should be set to 1, and `i` should remain 0.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, the length of `nums` must be greater than `i + 1`**
