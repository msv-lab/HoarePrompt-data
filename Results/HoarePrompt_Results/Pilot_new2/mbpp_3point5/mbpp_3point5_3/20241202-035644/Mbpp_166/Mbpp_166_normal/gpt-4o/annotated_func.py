#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.**
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
    #The program returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs, where even_pairs is the product of even_count and even_count - 1 divided by 2, and odd_pairs is the product of odd_count and odd_count - 1 divided by 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs. Even_pairs is the product of the count of even integers in the list multiplied by count - 1, divided by 2. Likewise, odd_pairs is calculated similarly. The function then returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs.
