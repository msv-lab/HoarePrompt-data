Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. It calculates the number of even and odd integers in the list, then uses a formula to calculate the number of pairs for each type of integer and returns the sum of both. The provided test cases also pass and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
