Correctness: **True**

The annotated program accurately reflects the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of elements in the tuple before encountering the first tuple element or breaking the loop due to a condition in the if statement. It returns this count as required by the problem description. The program handles all potential cases where tuples may be present or absent within the input tuple, ensuring it always behaves as described in the problem statement.
