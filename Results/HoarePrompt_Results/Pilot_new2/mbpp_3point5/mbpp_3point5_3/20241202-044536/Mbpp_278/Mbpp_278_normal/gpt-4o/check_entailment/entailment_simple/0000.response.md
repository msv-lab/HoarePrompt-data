Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple as input and iterates through the elements of the tuple. It counts the number of elements in the tuple before the first tuple element is encountered, and then returns this count. The program meets the problem description as it correctly finds the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple for all potential cases.
