Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through each element in the tuple `tup`, and if an element is a tuple, it returns the index of that element in the original tuple `tup`. If no tuple elements are found, the function returns the length of the tuple `tup`. This behavior aligns with the problem description of finding the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple. Therefore, the program is correct.
