According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the tuple `tup`. If there is at least one more element in the tuple after `elem`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements. If the element `elem` is a tuple, the function returns the index of the next element `elem` in the tuple `tup`. So to execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more element in the tuple `tup` after the current `elem`.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements and there is at least one more element in the tuple after the current `elem`.**
