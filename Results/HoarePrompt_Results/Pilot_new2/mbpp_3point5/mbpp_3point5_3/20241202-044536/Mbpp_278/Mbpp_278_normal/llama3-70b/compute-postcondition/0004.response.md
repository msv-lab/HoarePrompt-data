According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a tuple that must contain at least one element, and `elem` is not a tuple. For the loop to be executed one more time, the tuple `tup` must contain at least 2 elements, and the `elem` should be the next element in the tuple.
State: **`tup` is a tuple that must contain at least 2 elements, `elem` is the next element in the tuple**
