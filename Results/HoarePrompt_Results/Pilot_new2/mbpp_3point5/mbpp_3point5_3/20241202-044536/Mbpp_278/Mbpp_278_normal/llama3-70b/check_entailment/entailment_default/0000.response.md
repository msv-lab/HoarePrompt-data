Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to match the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through each element in the input tuple `tup`, and if it encounters a tuple element, it returns the index of that element in the original tuple `tup`. If no tuple elements are found, the function correctly returns the length of the tuple `tup`. 

Additionally, analyzing the output hints, they also align with the code's functionality. The hints specify that the function should return the index of the tuple element if found, and the code implements this logic correctly.

Since the code matches the problem description and the output hints, and there are no obvious edge cases where the code does not work as expected, the correctness of the code is **True**.
