Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively iterating through each item in the list. If the item is a list, it calls itself recursively on that item until all nested lists are flattened. If the item is not a list, it simply appends it to the `flat_list`. This process ensures that the final `flat_list` contains all the items from the nested list structure in a flattened format. The program adheres to the problem description as it successfully flattens any given nested list structure.
