Example Answer:
`flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`, where `element` is one of the elements in `nested_list`. The elements of `nested_list` remain the same, but `flat_list` is updated with the elements returned by `func_1(element)`. 
Output State: **nested_list is a list with at least 3 elements, flat_list is extended with the elements returned by func_1(element)**
