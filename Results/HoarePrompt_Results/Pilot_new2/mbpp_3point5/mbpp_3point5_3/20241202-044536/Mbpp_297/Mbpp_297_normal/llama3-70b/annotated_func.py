#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists.**
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for element in nested_list:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(element))
        else:
            flat_list.append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: nested_list is a list with at least 1 element. flat_list contains all the elements from nested_list after applying func_1 to any nested lists within nested_list.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list which contains all the elements from nested_list after applying func_1 to any nested lists within nested_list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list` which may contain nested lists. It recursively flattens the nested list structure and returns a flat list containing all elements from the nested list after applying `func_1` to any nested lists within `nested_list`. The function correctly handles nested lists and returns a flat list with all elements.
