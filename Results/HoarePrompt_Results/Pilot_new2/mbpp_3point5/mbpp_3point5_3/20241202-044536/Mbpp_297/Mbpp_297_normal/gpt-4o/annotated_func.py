    #The program returns a flat_list that contains all the items from nested_list after applying func_1 to any nested lists within nested_list
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a nested list structure. It recursively flattens the nested list structure by applying `func_1` to any nested lists within `nested_list`. The function returns a flat_list that contains all the items from `nested_list` after flattening the nested structure. The functionality of the function is to recursively flatten any nested lists within the input `nested_list` and return a flat list with all items.
