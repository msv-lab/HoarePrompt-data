According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 2 items, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least one item. If the item is a list, flat_list has been extended with the result of func_1 applied to the current item in nested_list. If the item is not a list, flat_list is a list containing the item that was appended. So for the loop to be executed one more time, nested_list must have at least 2 items, and the actions mentioned above must have been applied accordingly.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 2 items, flat_list has been extended/modified as per the conditions mentioned**
