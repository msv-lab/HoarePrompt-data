According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list has at least 1 element, and flat_list contains elements returned by func_1(element) if the element is a list. If the element is not a list, flat_list contains the first element of nested_list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, nested_list must have at least 2 elements.
State: **nested_list is a list that must have at least 2 elements, flat_list is a list containing the elements returned by func_1(element) if the element is a list. If the element is not a list, flat_list contains the first element of nested_list.**
