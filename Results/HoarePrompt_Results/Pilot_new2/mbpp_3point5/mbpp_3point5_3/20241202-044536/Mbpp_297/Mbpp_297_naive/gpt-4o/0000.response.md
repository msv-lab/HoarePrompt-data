Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively iterating through each element in the list. The function checks if the current item is a list, and if so, it calls itself recursively until all nested lists are flattened. The function then appends the non-list elements to the `flat_list` and returns the flattened list. The given test cases cover various scenarios of nested lists and the function produces the expected output for each case. Therefore, the code is correct.
