Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function recursively flattens a nested list structure by checking each item in the list. If the item is a list, it calls the function again on that sublist. If the item is not a list, it appends the item to the flattened list. The function is correctly implemented and the provided test cases cover different scenarios of nested lists, all of which return the expected flattened list. Hence, the program is correct.
