Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and replaces all spaces with '%20' using the `replace` method. This implementation correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20' for all potential cases. Since there is no specific edge case mentioned in the problem description, the program works as expected for all possible inputs.
