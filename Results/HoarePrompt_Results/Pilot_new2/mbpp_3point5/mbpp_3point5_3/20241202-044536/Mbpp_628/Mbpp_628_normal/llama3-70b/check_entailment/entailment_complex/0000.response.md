Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces with '%20'. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to replace all spaces in a given string with '%20'. The program always achieves this, making it correct.
