Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a string `s` as input and uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces with '%20'. This implementation directly aligns with the problem description, as it replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The function works correctly for all potential cases.
