Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple one-liner that calls the `upper()` method on the input string `s` to convert it to uppercase. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a Python function to convert a given string to uppercase. The output hints also confirm that the function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string, and returns the uppercase version of the string `s`. Since the code meets the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
