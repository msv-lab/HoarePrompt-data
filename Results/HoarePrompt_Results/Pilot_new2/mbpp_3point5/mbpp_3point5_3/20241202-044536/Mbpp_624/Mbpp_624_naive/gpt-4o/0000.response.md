Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. The function then asserts that the function returns the correct uppercase string for three different test cases. Since the program does exactly what the problem description states for all potential cases provided in the code, we can conclude that the program is correct.
