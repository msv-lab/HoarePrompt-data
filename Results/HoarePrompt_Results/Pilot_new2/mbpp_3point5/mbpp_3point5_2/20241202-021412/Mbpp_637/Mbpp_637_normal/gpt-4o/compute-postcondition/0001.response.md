The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cost_price` and `selling_price`. Both `cost_price` and `selling_price` are non-negative integers or floats. After executing the function body, if the cost price is equal to the selling price, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers or floats `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and return True if the cost price is equal to the selling price. If they are not equal, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers or floats `cost_price` and `selling_price`, returns True if the cost price is equal to the selling price. Otherwise, it returns False.**
