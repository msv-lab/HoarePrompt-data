Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` simply checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price` and returns True if they are equal, indicating that there is no profit or loss. This logic covers all potential cases as per the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the function would not work as expected, so the program is correct.
