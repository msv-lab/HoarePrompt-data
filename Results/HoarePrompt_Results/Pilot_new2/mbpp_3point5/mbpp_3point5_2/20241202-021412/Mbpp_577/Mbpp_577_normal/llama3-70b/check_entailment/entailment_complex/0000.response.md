Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly returns the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n` for the specified cases. Since the problem description only requires the program to find the last digit of the factorial for specific numbers (less than 4), the program fulfills the requirements. The comments in the code also explain the logic behind each return statement, which matches the problem description. Overall, the program is correct and follows the specified requirements.
