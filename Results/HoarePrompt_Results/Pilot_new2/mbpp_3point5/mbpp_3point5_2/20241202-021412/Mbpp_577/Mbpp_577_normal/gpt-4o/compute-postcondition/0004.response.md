According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is at least 1. The loop will iterate from 1 to n (inclusive). Since n is less than 5, the loop will execute for n values between 1 and 4. Before the loop starts, the factorial is initialized to 1. 
State: **n is a non-negative integer and less than 5, factorial is initialized to 1, i is 1**
