Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the factorial of a given number `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial. It handles the case where `n` is greater than or equal to 5 by returning 0, as the factorial of any number greater than or equal to 5 will end in 0. For numbers less than 5, it correctly calculates the factorial and returns the last digit. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
