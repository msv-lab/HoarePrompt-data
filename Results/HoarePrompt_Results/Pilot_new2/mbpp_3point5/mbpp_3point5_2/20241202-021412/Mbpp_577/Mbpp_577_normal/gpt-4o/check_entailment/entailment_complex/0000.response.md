Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the program returns 0, which is in line with the problem description. If `n` is less than 5, the program calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial, which is also what the problem description specifies.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for and is correct.
