According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times starting from 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer and less than 5, so `n` can be either 1, 2, 3, or 4. The `factorial` is updated to its current value multiplied by `i`, and `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be increased by 1, `factorial` should be updated with the new value after multiplication with `i+1`, and `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and less than 6, `factorial` is updated to its current value multiplied by `i+1`, `i` is increased by 1**
