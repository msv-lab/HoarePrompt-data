According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer and less than 5, `factorial` is updated to its current value multiplied by `i`, and `i` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be a non-negative integer and less than 5, `factorial` should be updated to its current value multiplied by `i+1`, and `i` should be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and less than 5, `factorial` is updated to its current value multiplied by `i+1`, `i` is increased by 1**
