Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The program only returns specific values for certain input numbers, rather than calculating the factorial and returning the last digit. For example, if we input 5, the program should return 0 as the last digit of 5! is 0. However, the program will return 0 for any input number greater than 4, which is not correct.
