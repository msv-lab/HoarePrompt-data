According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 3, as the range starts from 2 and `n` should be a non-negative integer larger than 2. Additionally, the loop will execute as long as `i` ranges from 2 to the square root of `n`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are: `n` must be at least 3, and `i` is now 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of n elements where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are False and all other elements are True**
