According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since `n` is at least 4 and `i` is 4, the loop will execute. 

For the loop to execute successfully and meet the specified conditions:
1. `is_prime[4]` must be True
2. After execution:
   - `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` should remain False
   - `is_prime[3]` should be True
   - All `is_prime[j]` where j is a multiple of 3 and in the range `[3 * 3, n)` should be set to False
   - All other `is_prime[j]` where j is not a multiple of 3 in the range `[3, n)` should become True

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `is_prime[4]` is True, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are False, `is_prime[3]` is True, multiples of 3 in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are set to False, all other `is_prime[j]` where j is not a multiple of 3 in the range `[3, n)` are True**
