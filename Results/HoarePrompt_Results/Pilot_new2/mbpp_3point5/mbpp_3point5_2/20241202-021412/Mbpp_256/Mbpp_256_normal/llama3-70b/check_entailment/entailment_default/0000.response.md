Initial assessment: The two functions seem to be functioning correctly based on the problem description. `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the count of prime numbers between 2 and `n` (exclusive) by iterating through the numbers from 2 to `n`, excluding `n`, and incrementing count for each prime number found. `is_prime` determines if a given number is prime by checking divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number. 

Output hints analysis: The output hints seem to align with the code and reinforce the correctness of the functions. They describe the behavior of the functions accurately, including the logic for checking prime numbers and counting them up to the given input number `n`.

Therefore, based on the initial assessment and the output hints agreement with the code, the functions seem to follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
