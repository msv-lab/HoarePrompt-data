According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 3 and `i` is 3. Additionally, the loop executes based on the range specified `(i * i, n, i)`. 

To update the state for the loop to execute:
- `is_prime[3]` must be True
- `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` must remain False
- All `is_prime[j]` where j is a multiple of 3 and in the range `[3 * 3, n)` must be set to False
- `i` should be 3

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `is_prime[3]` is True, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` remain False, all `is_prime[j]` multiples of 3 in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are False**
