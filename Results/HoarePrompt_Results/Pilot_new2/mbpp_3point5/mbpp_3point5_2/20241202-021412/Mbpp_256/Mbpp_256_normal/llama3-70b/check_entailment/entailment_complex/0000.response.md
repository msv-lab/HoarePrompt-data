Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The `func_1` function correctly takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`.
- The `is_prime` function correctly determines if a given number is a prime number or not.
- The annotations and the code logic align with the problem description, ensuring that the program functions as expected for all potential cases.
