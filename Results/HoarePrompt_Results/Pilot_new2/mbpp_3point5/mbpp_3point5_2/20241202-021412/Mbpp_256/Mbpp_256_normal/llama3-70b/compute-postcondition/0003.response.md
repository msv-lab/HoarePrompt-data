According to the code, for the loop to execute, `num` must be a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, the range in the for loop statement starts from 2 and ends at the square root of `num` (excluding the square root itself). Therefore, the adjusted states before the loop starts are:
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `num` must be greater than 3**
