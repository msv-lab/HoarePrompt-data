According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then the program updates the state such that `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` remain False, `is_prime[i]` is True, and all `is_prime[j]` where j is a multiple of i and in the range `[i * i, n)` are set to False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3. If `is_prime[3]` is True, then the program updates the state such that `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` remain False, `is_prime[3]` is True, and all `is_prime[j]` where j is a multiple of 3 and in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are set to False**
