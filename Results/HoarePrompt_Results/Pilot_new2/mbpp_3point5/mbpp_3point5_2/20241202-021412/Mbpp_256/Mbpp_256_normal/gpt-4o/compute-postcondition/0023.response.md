Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3. If `is_prime[3]` is True, then after the execution, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` remain False, `is_prime[3]` is True, and all `is_prime[j]` where j is a multiple of 3 and in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are set to False. Additionally, all other `is_prime[j]` where j is not a multiple of 3 in the range `[3, n)` become True.***
