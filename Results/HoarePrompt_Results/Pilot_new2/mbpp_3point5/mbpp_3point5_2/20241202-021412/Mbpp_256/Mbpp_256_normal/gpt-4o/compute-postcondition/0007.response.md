According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`, and `i` is such that `is_prime[i]` is True. The loop will also execute if `j` is in the range specified by the for loop statement. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2 such that `is_prime[i]` is True, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1] are False, `j` is in the range `[i * i, n)`**
