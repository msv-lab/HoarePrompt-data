Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `is_prime(num: int) -> bool` to check whether a given number is prime or not. It then iterates over numbers from 2 to n (exclusive) and counts the number of prime numbers. The logic of checking for prime numbers seems correct, as it checks divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number. The iteration over the range 2 to n also seems accurate for counting prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and no specific case has been identified where it does not work as expected, the correctness is deemed to be true.
