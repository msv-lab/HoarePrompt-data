Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program defines a function that correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. The program starts by initializing a list `is_prime` with `True` values for each number up to the given number `n`. It then marks 0 and 1 as not prime numbers. The program then iterates through all numbers up to the square root of `n` and marks multiples of prime numbers as not prime. Finally, it returns the sum of all the `True` values in the `is_prime` list, which are the prime numbers less than `n`.

The program has been tested with multiple test cases, and it produces the expected output for `func_1(5)`, `func_1(10)`, and `func_1(100)`. Since the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all tested cases, we can conclude that the program is correct.
