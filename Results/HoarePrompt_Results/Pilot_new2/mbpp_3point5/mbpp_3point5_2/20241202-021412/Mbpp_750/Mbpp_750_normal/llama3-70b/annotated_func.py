#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tup is a tuple.**
def func_1(lst, tup):
    return lst + list(tup)
    #The program returns the concatenation of list `lst` and the elements of tuple `tup` as a list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the elements of `lst` and the elements of `tup`. It correctly converts the tuple `tup` to a list and concatenates it with the list `lst`.
