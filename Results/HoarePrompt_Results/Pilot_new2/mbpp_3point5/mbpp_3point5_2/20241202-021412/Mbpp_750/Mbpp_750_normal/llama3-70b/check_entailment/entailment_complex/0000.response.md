Correctness: **True**

The given annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input. It then converts the tuple `tup` to a list and concatenates it with the list `lst`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for - writing a function to add the given tuple to the given list. Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description and always does what is expected.
