Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code for the function `func_1` follows the problem description accurately. It takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, converts the tuple to a list using the `list()` function, and then concatenates the elements of the tuple `tup` with the elements of the list `lst`. The code does what is expected and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description where it might fail to deliver the correct output. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the function behaves as described in the problem description.
