Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then returns a new list that contains the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tpl`. The program achieves the goal stated in the problem description, which is to add the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it with the original list. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
