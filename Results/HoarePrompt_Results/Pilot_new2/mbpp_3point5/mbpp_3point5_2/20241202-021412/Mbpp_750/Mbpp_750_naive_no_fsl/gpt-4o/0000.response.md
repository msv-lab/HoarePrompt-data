Correctness: True

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, converts the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)` and then concatenates the two lists using the `+` operator. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function correctly adds the tuple elements to the given list and returns the expected list. There are no edge cases or scenarios identified where the program does not behave as described in the problem statement.
