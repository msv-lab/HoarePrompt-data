The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are both non-negative numbers. The function calculates the volume using the formula `math.pi * radius^2 * height` and returns the calculated volume. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-negative numbers, calculate the volume using the provided formula, and return the calculated volume.
