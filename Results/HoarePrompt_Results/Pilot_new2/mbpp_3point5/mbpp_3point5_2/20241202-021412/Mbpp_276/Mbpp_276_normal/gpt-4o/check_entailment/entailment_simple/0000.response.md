Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula provided in the problem description: `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The function takes in the radius and height of the cylinder as parameters and returns the calculated volume. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, making the program correct.
