#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cylinder calculated using the formula math.pi * radius
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius * radius * height`.
