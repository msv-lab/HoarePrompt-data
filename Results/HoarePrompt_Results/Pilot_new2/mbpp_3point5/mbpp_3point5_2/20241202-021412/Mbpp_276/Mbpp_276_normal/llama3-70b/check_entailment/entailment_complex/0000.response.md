Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the volume of the cylinder calculated using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. This matches exactly with the problem description which asks for a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder given the radius and height.

Therefore, the program is correct as it fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
