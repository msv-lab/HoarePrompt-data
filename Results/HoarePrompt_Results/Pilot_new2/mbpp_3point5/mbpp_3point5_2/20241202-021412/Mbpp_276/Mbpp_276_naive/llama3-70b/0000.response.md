Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it is missing the import statement for the math module. Without the math module imported, the program will raise a NameError when trying to access `math.pi`. 

Example of incorrect behavior:
```
func_1(2, 3)
```

To correct the program, the following import statement should be added at the beginning of the program:
```
import math
```
