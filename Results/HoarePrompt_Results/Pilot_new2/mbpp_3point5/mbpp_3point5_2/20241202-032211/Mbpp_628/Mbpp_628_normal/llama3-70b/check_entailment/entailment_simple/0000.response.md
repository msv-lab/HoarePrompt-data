Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces in the string with '%20'. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The program consistently replaces all spaces with '%20' for every potential case, so it meets the requirements of the problem description.
