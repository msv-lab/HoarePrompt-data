Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string parameter `s` and returns a new string where all spaces in `s` are replaced by '%20'. The program uses the `replace` method to achieve this, which aligns with the problem description of replacing all spaces in the given string with '%20'. Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description asks for.
