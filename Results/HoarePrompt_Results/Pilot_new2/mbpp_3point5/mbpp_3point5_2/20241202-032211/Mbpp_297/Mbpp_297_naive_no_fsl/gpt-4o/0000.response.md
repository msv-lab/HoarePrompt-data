Correctness: True

The program defines a function `func_1` that recursively flattens a given nested list structure. The function correctly iterates over each element in the input list, checking if the element is a list or not. If the element is a list, it recursively calls itself on the sub-list; otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. The function then returns the flattened list.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios of nested lists and the function correctly flattens them as expected. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and passes all the test cases, it can be considered correct.
