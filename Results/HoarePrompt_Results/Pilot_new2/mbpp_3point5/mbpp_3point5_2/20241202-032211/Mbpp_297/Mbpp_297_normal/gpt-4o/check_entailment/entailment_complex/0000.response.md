Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the function to flatten a nested list structure. The function func_1 recursively iterates through the nested_list and flattens the structure by appending non-list items and recursively calling itself to flatten nested lists. This approach ensures that the function returns a flat list containing all elements from the nested_list, as required by the problem description. The annotations provided also clearly explain the behavior of the program at each step, further confirming its correctness.
