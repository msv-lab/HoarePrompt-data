Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the function to flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively flattens the nested structure and returns a flat list containing all elements from the nested_list. The code successfully handles nested lists of different depths and sizes, as shown in the provided test cases. The output hints also align with the code and further confirm that the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
