Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements a recursive function `func_1` that takes a nested list structure as input and flattens it into a single list. It achieves this by iterating through the elements of the nested list, checking if the element is a list, and recursively applying the function to flatten that inner list. This process continues until all inner lists have been flattened, resulting in a single flat list containing all elements from the original nested list.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly flattening the given nested list structure.
