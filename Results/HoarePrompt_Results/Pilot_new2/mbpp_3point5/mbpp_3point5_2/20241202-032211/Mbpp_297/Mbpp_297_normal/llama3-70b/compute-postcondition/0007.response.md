According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there are more elements left in the nested_list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list has at least 1 element. If the first element in nested_list is a list, then flat_list contains the elements returned by func_1(element). Otherwise, flat_list contains the first element of nested_list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least one more element left in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 more element left**
