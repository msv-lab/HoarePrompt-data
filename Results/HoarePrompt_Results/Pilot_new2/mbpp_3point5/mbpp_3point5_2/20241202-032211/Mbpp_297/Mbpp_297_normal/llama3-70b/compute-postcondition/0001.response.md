According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, flat_list being empty does not affect the execution of the loop. So, for the loop to execute, the nested_list must have at least 1 element, and the element is the first element in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 1 element, flat_list is an empty list, element is the first element in the nested_list**
