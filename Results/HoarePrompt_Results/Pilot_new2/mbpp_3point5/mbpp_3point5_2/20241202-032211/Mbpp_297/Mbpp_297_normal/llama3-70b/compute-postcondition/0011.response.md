According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there is at least one more element left in the nested_list, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 more element left. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the nested_list needs to be processed. If the next element is a list, the flat_list will be extended by the result of func_1(element). If the next element is not a list, the element will be appended to the flat_list.

State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 more element left to be processed for the next iteration.**
