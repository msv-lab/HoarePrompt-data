According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since flat_list is an empty list containing no elements, it must be adjusted so that nested_list has at least 1 element for the loop to execute. Additionally, item in the loop will correspond to the first element in the nested_list.
State: **Output State: flat_list is an empty list containing no elements, nested_list is a list that must have at least 1 element, item is the first element in nested_list**.
