Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input, combines the elements of both lists, removes duplicates using the `set` data type, finds the symmetric difference between the two sets of elements using the `^` operator, and finally returns a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both. This aligns with the problem description provided. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code and further clarify the expected behavior of the function. Since the code covers all possible cases and meets the specified requirements, it can be considered correct in this context.
