Example Answer: 
The set `diff_elements` is assigned the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`. The symmetric difference consists of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both. The states of `list1` and `list2` are not affected.  
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists; set1 is a set created from list1; set2 is a set created from list2; diff_elements contains elements that are in either set1 or set2, but not in both**
