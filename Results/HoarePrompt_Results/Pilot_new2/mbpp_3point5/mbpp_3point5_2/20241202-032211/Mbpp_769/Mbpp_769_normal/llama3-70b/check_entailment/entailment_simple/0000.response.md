Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by getting the difference between two lists. It uses the ^ operator to get the symmetric difference between the two sets created from the input lists, then converts it back to a list, and finally sorts it. This results in a list of unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both. This approach ensures that the program always follows the problem description.
