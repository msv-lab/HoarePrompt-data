Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both. The program achieves this by using the set data structure to remove duplicates and the symmetric difference operator (^) to get the elements that are unique to each list. Finally, the result is sorted before being returned.

The program follows the problem description accurately as it correctly implements the logic to get the difference between two lists as described. Therefore, the correctness is True.
