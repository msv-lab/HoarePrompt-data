Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the difference between two lists as per the problem description. The program first converts both lists to sets, then uses the XOR operator (^) to find the symmetric difference between the two sets, and finally returns the sorted list of the symmetric difference.

However, this approach does not accurately represent the difference between two lists. The symmetric difference includes elements that are present in either of the two lists, but not in both. This is not the same as finding the elements that are present in one list but not in the other, which is the requirement of the problem description.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly compute the difference between two lists and is incorrect based on the problem description.
