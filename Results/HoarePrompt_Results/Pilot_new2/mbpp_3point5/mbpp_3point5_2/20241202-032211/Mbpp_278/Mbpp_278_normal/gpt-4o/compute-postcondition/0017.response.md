Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter. It iterates through the elements of the tuple until it encounters the first tuple element. It then returns the number of elements in the tuple before the first tuple element is encountered or the total number of elements if no tuple is encountered. If the tuple is empty, it returns 0.**
