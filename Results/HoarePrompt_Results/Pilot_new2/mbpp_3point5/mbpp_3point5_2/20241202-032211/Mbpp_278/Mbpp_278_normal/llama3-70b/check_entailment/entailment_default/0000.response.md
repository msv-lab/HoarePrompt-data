Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` iterates through the elements of the tuple `tup` and returns the index of the first tuple found in `tup`. However, the problem description states that the function should find the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple, not the index of the tuple itself. The code is incorrect as it does not return the count of elements before the tuple.
