The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. The program returns the number of elements in the tuple before the first tuple element is encountered or the total number of elements if no tuple is encountered. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return the number of elements in the tuple before encountering the first tuple element, or the total number of elements if no tuple is encountered.
