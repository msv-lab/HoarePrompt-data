Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the elements of the tuple until it encounters the first tuple element. It then returns the number of elements in the tuple before the first tuple element is encountered or the total number of elements if no tuple is encountered. The code handles the case when the tuple is empty by returning 0. Additionally, the provided examples in the problem description are correctly implemented in the code and return the expected results. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the code is correct for all potential cases.
