Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_data`, a minimum height `min_height`, and a minimum weight `min_weight`. The function then filters the student data based on the condition that the student's height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. It returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values, satisfying the filtering condition.

The program follows the problem description accurately as it filters the students based on both height and weight being above the minimum requirements. The comprehension used in the function correctly creates a new dictionary with the filtered student data, ensuring that only students meeting the height and weight criteria are included. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
