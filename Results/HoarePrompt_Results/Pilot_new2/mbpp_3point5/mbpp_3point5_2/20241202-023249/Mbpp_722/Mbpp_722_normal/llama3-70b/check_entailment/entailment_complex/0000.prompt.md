You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The input is given as - a dictionary with a student name as a key and a tuple of float (student_height, student_weight) as a value, - minimal height, - minimal weight. Write a function to filter students that have height and weight above the minimum.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: student_data is a dictionary where keys are student names and values are tuples of float (student_height, student_weight). min_height and min_weight are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively.**
def func_1(student_data, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for name, (height, weight) in student_data.
    items() if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values, for students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a dictionary containing student data, along with minimum height and minimum weight values. It filters the student data based on the condition that the student's height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight. The function then returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values, satisfying the filtering condition.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
