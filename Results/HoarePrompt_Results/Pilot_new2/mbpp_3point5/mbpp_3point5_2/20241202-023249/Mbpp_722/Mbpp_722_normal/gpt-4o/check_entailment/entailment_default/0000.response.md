Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_dict`, a minimum height `min_height`, and a minimum weight `min_weight`. The function filters the student information based on the minimum height and weight provided, returning a dictionary with only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The code iterates through the student dictionary and checks if each student's height and weight meet the minimum requirements. If they do, the student is included in the output dictionary.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, it appears that the code correctly implements the specified functionality. The output hints also align with the code's logic, confirming that the code is filtering the students based on the minimum height and weight criteria specified. Since there are no cases identified where the code does not work as expected, the correctness is determined to be **True**.
