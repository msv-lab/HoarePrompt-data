Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a dictionary containing student data, along with minimum height and minimum weight values. It filters the student data based on the condition that the student's height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight. The function then returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values, satisfying the filtering condition. **

Potential Edge Cases/Missing Functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where student_data is empty or the input parameters are not valid (e.g., non-numeric values).
- If the student_data dictionary key does not exist or the corresponding value does not contain a tuple with height and weight, it could potentially raise an error.
- If min_height or min_weight are negative values, the filtering logic might not work as expected.
