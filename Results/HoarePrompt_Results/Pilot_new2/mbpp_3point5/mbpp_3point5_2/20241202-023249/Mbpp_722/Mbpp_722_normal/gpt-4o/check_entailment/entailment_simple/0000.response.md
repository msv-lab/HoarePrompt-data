Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function that takes in a dictionary of student names mapped to tuples of height and weight, as well as minimum height and minimum weight values. It then filters the dictionary based on the minimum height and minimum weight criteria and returns a new dictionary with only the students who meet those criteria.

The program correctly filters out students whose height and weight are above the minimum values, as stated in the problem description. It creates a new dictionary with only the students who meet these criteria.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
