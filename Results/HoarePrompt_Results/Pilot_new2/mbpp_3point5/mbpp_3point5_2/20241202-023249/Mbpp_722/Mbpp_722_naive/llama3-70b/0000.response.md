Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates over the student data dictionary and filters out the students whose height and weight are above the given minimum height and weight thresholds. The logic of the function seems correct as it correctly checks both the height and weight conditions for each student and returns a filtered dictionary accordingly. Additionally, the use of dictionary comprehension makes the code concise and readable. Since the function appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is deemed to be True.
