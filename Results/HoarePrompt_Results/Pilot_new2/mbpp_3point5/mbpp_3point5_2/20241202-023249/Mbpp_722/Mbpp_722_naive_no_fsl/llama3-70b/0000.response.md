Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes in a dictionary of student data, minimum height, and minimum weight, and filters out the students whose height and weight are above the minimum values. The program correctly iterates through the dictionary items, checks the height and weight of each student, and returns a new dictionary with only the students who meet the criteria. The logic of the program seems correct and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description. Thus, the program can be considered correct.
