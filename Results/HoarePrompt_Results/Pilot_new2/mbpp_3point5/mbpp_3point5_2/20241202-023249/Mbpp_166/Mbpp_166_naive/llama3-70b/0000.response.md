Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates through all pairs of integers in the list and checks if the xor of the pair is even. This logic correctly counts the number of pairs of integers that xor to an even number as per the problem description. The code covers all possible pairs and correctly identifies the pairs that meet the criteria. Therefore, the program is correct.
