Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number by iterating through all valid pairs of elements in the list. However, the code only checks if the XOR result is divisible by 2 to determine if it is even. This approach does not consider the case where the XOR result is 0, which is also an even number. Therefore, the code does not handle the scenario where a pair of integers XOR to 0, resulting in an incorrect count of pairs that XOR to an even number.
