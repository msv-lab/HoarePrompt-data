Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the function described in the problem description. The function `func_1` counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number by calculating the sum of even pairs and odd pairs. The calculation for even pairs and odd pairs is done correctly as explained in the annotations. The function then returns the sum of these pairs, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description and always computes the correct number of pairs of integers that xor to an even number in the given list.
