#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.**
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
    #The program returns the sum of even pairs and odd pairs where even pairs are calculated as the product of even_count and even_count - 1 divided by 2, and odd pairs are calculated as the product of odd_count and odd_count - 1 divided by 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the sum of even pairs and odd pairs. Even pairs are computed by multiplying the count of even numbers by one less than that count and dividing by 2. Similarly, odd pairs are calculated using the count of odd numbers in the list. The function then returns the sum of these even and odd pairs.
