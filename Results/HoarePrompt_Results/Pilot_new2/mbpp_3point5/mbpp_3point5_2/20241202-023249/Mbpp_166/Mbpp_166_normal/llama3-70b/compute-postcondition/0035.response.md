Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is the total number of times ((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0) is true for all valid pairs of i and j, where i is len(nums) + 2, `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than len(nums) - 2. The overall state after the execution of the if else block depends on the specific values of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`. If ((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0), `count` is incremented by 1.***
