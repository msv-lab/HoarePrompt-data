Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and iterates through the tuple. If it encounters a `None` value in the tuple, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to check if the given tuple has any `None` value or not. The program returns True when there is a `None` value and False when there are no `None` values, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
