You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given tuple has any none value or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    for item in tup:
        if item is None:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a tuple with all non-None items. If any item in `tup` is None, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns None.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. It iterates through the tuple and if it encounters a `None` value, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. The function will always return False if there are no `None` values in the tuple.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
