Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses the `any` function to determine if any element in the tuple is `None`. If any element is `None`, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. This matches the problem description perfectly as the function is checking if the given tuple has any `None` value or not. Therefore, the program is correct.
