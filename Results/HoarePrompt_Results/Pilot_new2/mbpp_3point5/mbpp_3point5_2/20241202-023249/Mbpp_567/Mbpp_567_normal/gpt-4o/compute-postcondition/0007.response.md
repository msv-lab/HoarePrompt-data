According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the list `lst`. If `i` is less than the length of `lst - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, i is 1, and the element at index i in lst is less than or equal to the element at index i + 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be increased by 1.
State: **lst is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, i is 2. The element at index i in lst is less than or equal to the element at index i + 1**
