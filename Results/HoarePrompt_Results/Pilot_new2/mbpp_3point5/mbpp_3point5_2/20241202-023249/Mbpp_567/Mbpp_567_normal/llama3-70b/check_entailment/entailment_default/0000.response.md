Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns True if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False. The code uses the `all()` function along with a generator expression to check if each element is less than or equal to the next element in the list, which correctly identifies whether the list is sorted or not. Additionally, there are no edge cases mentioned in the description that the code does not handle.
