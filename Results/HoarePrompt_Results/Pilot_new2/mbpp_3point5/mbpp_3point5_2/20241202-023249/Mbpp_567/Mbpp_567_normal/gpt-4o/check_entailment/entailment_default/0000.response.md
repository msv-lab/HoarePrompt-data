Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the input list `lst` and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If at any point an element is greater than the next one, the function returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, the function returns True, indicating that the list is sorted. The code terminates the loop as soon as it encounters the first out-of-order element, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description. The code does not handle cases where the input list has less than 2 elements or contains non-comparable elements, which is consistent with the problem description. Overall, the code aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description, and there are no edge cases identified where the code does not work as expected.
