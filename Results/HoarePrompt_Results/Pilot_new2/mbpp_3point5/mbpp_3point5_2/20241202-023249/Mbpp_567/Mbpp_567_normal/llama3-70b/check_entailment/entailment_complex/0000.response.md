Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and checks if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order. It does this by using a generator expression within the `all()` function, which iterates through pairs of adjacent elements in the list and checks if each pair is in non-decreasing order.

The program meets the problem description as it accurately checks whether a specified list is sorted or not, returning True if all elements are in non-decreasing order and False otherwise. The program does not handle cases where the input list is empty, but this does not affect its correctness based on the problem description.
