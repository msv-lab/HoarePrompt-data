Functionality: The function func_1 accepts a list lst of comparable elements. It iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If at any point an element is greater than the next one, the function returns False. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, the function returns True. The function terminates the loop as soon as it encounters the first out-of-order element. It does not handle cases where the input list has less than 2 elements or contains non-comparable elements.
