According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0. The element at index i in lst is less than or equal to the element at index i + 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **lst is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, i is 1. The element at index i in lst is less than or equal to the element at index i + 1**
