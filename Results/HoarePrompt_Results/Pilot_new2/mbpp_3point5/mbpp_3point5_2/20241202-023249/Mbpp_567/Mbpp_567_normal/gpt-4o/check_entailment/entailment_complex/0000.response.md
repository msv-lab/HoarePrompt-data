Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` of comparable elements and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If an element is found to be greater than the next one, the function immediately returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements, the function returns True, indicating that the list is sorted.

The program follows the problem description accurately by checking whether the specified list is sorted or not. It correctly handles cases where the input list has at least 2 elements and all elements are comparable. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the program's functionality, ensuring that it aligns with the problem description. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
