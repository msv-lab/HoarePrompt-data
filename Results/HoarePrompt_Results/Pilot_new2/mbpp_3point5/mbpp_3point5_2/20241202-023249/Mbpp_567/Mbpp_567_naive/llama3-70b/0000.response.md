Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` iterates over the input list `lst` and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If this condition holds for all elements in the list, then the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. This logic covers all potential cases where the list is not sorted, making the program correct.
