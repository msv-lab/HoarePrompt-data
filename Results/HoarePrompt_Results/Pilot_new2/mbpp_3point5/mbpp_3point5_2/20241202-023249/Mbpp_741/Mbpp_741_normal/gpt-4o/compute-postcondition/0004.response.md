According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the string `s` is not empty. `s` being a string and not empty is already given. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `char` is the first character of the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a string, `s` is not empty, `first_char` is the first character of the string `s`**
