Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines the function `func_1(s)` which checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same. It first checks if the string is empty and returns True if it is. Then, it iterates through each character in the string and compares it to the first character. If any character is different, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. This logic ensures that the function accurately determines whether all characters in the string are the same, which aligns with the problem description. It covers all cases and follows the requirements specified in the problem description.
