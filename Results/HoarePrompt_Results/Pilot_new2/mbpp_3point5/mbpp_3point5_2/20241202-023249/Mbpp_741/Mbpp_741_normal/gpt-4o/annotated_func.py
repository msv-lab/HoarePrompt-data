#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *s is a string. The string s is not empty (s is not equal to "").
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the loop executes, then all characters in the string `s` must be the same as the `first_char`. If the loop does not execute, no change occurs in the program state.
    return True
    #The program returns True if all characters in the string `s` are the same as the `first_char`. If the loop does not execute, no change occurs in the program state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. The function checks if the string `s` is empty, and if so, it returns True. If `s` is not empty, it compares all characters in the string to the first character. It returns True if all characters are the same as the first character, otherwise it returns False. The function may not handle the case where the input string is None or has special characters beyond the basic alphabet or numbers as the conditions focus on character equality within the string.
