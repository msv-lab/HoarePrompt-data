According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters remaining in the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the same as `first_char`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must still have characters remaining after the current iteration, and the `char` variable should represent the next character in the string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with characters remaining, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the next character after `first_char` in `s`**
