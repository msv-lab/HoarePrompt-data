Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string parameter `s` and returns True if all characters in the string are the same, and False otherwise. The use of `set(s)` will remove all duplicate characters in the string, so if the length of the set is 1, it means all characters are the same. Therefore, the program correctly implements the problem description.
