#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a complex number.
def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))
    #The program returns the polar coordinates of the complex number 'num' as a tuple (r, phi) where r is the magnitude and phi is the phase angle in radians
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a complex number `num` and returns its polar coordinates as a tuple (r, phi) where r is the magnitude and phi is the phase angle in radians. The function utilizes the cmath library to calculate the polar coordinates.
