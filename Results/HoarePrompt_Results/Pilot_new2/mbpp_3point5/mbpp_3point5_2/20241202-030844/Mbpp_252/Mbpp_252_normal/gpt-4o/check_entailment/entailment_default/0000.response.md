Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct as it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns its polar coordinates as a tuple (r, phi) where r is the magnitude and phi is the phase angle in radians. The code utilizes the cmath library to calculate the polar coordinates. The provided assert statements also seem to be validating the correctness of the function for specific input values. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints do not indicate any potential edge cases that the code might not handle, the correctness of the code can be inferred as True.
