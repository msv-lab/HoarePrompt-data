The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `c`. `c` is a complex number. After executing the function body, the program returns the absolute value of the complex number `c` and the phase of the complex number `c`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a complex number `c` and return its absolute value and phase. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a complex number c and returns its absolute value and phase.**
