Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a complex number `c` and returns its absolute value and phase, which is correctly calculated using the `abs()` and `cmath.phase()` functions. Additionally, there are no edge cases or missing functionalities to consider in this scenario. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming its correctness.
