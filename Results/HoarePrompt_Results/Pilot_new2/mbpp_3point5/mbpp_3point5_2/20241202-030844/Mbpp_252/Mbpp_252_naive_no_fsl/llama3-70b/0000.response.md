Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns a tuple containing the absolute value (magnitude) of the complex number and its phase (angle) in polar coordinates. The program uses the `abs` function to calculate the magnitude and the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase.

The program seems to correctly implement the problem description as it calculates the absolute value and phase of the complex number, which are the components of polar coordinates. There are no edge cases or potential inputs mentioned in the problem description that the program does not handle. Thus, based on the information provided, the program can be considered correct.
