Correctness: **True**

The program correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string 's' by only keeping the uppercase characters. The program uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the string 's' and only include the characters that are uppercase. This ensures that only uppercase characters are retained in the final output string, which aligns with the problem description.
