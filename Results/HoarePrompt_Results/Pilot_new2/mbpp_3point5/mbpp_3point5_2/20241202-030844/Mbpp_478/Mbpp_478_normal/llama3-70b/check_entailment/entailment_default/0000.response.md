Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code follows the problem description as it takes a string input `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string. The code achieves this by using a generator expression within the `join()` method to filter out the lowercase characters. Since the description specifies that the function should remove lowercase substrings and return the uppercase characters only, the code is correct. Additionally, the output hints also support this by confirming that the function returns a string consisting of only uppercase characters from the input string.
