Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description as it is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from the given string. However, the program only keeps uppercase characters and removes lowercase characters. This means that the program does not remove the lowercase substrings as required. Hence, the program is incorrect.

For example:
- Input: 'PYTHon'
- Expected output: 'PYTH'
- Actual output: 'PYTHO'
