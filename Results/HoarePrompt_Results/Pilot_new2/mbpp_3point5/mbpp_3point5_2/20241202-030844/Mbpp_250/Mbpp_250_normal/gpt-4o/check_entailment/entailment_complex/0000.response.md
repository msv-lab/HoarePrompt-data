Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element to be searched in the tuple. It then uses the `count` method of tuples in Python to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. This is exactly what the problem description asks for - counting the occurrences of a specific element in a tuple. The function returns the correct count and handles the case where the element is not found in the tuple by returning 0. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
