The function `func_1` takes two parameters, a tuple `tup`, and a value `element`, then it returns the number of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`. If `element` is not found in `tup`, the function will return 0. The function effectively counts the occurrences of a specific value within a tuple.
