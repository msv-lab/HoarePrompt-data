Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them using the `max` function provided by Python. This implementation directly aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to find the maximum of two numbers. 

After careful review, it is evident that the code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also confirm that the function correctly returns the maximum value between the two input parameters. Therefore, the code is correct and satisfies the problem specifications.
