The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the program returns two lists: the first list contains the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements, and then return two lists—one containing the first elements of each sublist and the other containing the second elements of each sublist.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns two lists—one with the first elements of each sublist and the other with the second elements of each sublist.**
