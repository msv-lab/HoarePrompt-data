Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The program uses list comprehension to achieve this in a concise manner. 

For example:
Input: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
Output: [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]

The program handles this case correctly and produces the expected output. Since there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as described, the Correctness is considered True.
