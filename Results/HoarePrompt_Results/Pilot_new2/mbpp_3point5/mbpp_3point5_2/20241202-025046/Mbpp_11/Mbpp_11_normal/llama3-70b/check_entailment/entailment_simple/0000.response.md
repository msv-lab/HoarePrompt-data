Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not fully meet the problem description. While it correctly removes the first occurrence of the given character, it does not remove the last occurrence as required by the problem description. 

For example, if the input string is "hello world" and the character to remove is 'o', the current program will output "hell world" instead of "hell wrld" as expected. 

Therefore, the program does not fully adhere to the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
