Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns a new string obtained by removing the character at the first and last occurrence of `ch` in the original string `s`. If either the first index or last index is not found, or if both indices are the same, the function returns the original string `s`. **
