Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists of numbers as input and divides them element-wise. It first checks if the two lists have the same length, and if they do not, it raises a `ValueError`. If the lengths are the same, it then creates a new list by dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. This implementation correctly divides two lists element-wise, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
