Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and divides each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`, returning a new list containing the results. The code also includes a check to ensure that both lists must be of the same length, raising a `ValueError` if they are not. This aligns with the problem description.

The code provides the expected functionality of dividing two lists element-wise and ensures that the lists are of the same length before performing the division operation. Since the code meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct.
