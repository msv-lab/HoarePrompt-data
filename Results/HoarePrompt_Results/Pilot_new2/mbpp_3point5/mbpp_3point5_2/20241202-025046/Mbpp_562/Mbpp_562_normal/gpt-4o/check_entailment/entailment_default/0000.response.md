Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and iterates through each sublist to find the maximum length of sublists. It then returns this maximum length. The code structure aligns with the problem description, where the goal is to find the length of the longest sublist in the input list of lists. 

Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function `func_1` is expected to iterate through the sublists and find the maximum length as described. The provided examples in the problem description also match the behavior of the code. 

Overall, the code appears to be correct as it follows the problem description and the output hints, accurately determining the length of the longest sublists in the input list of lists.
