Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists. `max_length` is updated to the length of the sublist in the previous iteration. If the length of `sublist` is greater than the current `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
