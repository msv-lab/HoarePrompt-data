Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It iterates through each sublist to find the maximum length and returns that value as the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description of finding the length of the longest sublists. The program is correct because it always returns the correct maximum length of the sublists.
