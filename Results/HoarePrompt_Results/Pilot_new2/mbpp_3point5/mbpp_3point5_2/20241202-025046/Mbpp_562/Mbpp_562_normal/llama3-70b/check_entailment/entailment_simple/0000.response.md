Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input. It then uses a generator expression to iterate over each sublist in the input list and calculates the length of each sublist. Finally, it returns the maximum length found among all the sublists.

This implementation aligns with the problem description as it correctly finds and returns the length of the longest sublist within the given list of lists. It covers all potential cases and always returns the correct output.
