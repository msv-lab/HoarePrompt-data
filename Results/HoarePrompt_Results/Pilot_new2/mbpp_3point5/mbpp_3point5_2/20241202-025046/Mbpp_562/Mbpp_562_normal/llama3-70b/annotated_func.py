#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists.**
def func_1(lists):
    return max(len(sublist) for sublist in lists)
    #The program returns the length of the longest sublist within the list of lists 'lists'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter lists, which is a list of lists. It then returns the length of the longest sublist within the list of lists 'lists'. If 'lists' is empty, the function will return an error as it does not handle the case of an empty list.
