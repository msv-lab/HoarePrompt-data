Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array using enumerate to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index position. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The logic follows the problem description for every potential case, so the program is correct.
