Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in an array `arr` and an element. It then iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value at that index. If the value matches the given element, it returns True and the index. If no match is found after iterating through the whole array, it returns False and -1.

This implementation follows the problem description accurately by returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). It covers all potential cases as it returns the correct outputs based on whether the element is found or not in the array.
