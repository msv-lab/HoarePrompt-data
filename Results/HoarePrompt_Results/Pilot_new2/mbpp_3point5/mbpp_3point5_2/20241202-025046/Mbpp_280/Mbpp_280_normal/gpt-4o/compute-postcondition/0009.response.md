Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `index` is the index of the third element, and `value` is the value of the third element. If the value of the third element in the list 'arr' is equal to `element`, then the program returns True and the index of the third element in `arr`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
