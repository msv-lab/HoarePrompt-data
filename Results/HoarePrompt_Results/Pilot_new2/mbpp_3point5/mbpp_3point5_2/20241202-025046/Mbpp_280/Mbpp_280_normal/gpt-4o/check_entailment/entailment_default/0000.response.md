Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in an array `arr` and an element `element` as input. It then iterates through the elements of the array using enumerate and checks if any element matches the given `element`. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing True and the index of the element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple containing False and -1 as the index.

The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly identifies if the element is in the array and provides the index position when the element is found. The function handles the cases where the element is present at different index positions in the array and returns the correct output tuple.

Additionally, the output hints further support the correctness of the code by explaining that the function iterates through the elements of the list, checks for a matching element, and returns the appropriate tuple based on the match. The hints describe the behavior of the code accurately, confirming that the code meets the specified requirements.
