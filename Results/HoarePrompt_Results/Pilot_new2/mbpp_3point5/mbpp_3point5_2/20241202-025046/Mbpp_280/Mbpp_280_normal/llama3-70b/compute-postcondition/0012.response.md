The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `arr` which is a list and `elem` which can be any data type. 

The function has multiple return cases:
Case_1: If `elem` is found at index 0 in the list `arr`, the program returns True along with the value of `i`, which is 0.
Case_2: If `elem` is found at index 1 in the list `arr`, the program returns True along with the value of `i`, which is 1.
Case_3: If `elem` is found at index 2 in the list `arr`, the program returns True along with the value of `i`, which is 2.
Case_4: If `elem` is not found in the list `arr`, the program returns False along with the index of -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to search for the element `elem` in the list `arr` and return True along with the index where the element is found. If the element is not found, it returns False along with the index of -1.
