The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` containing elements of any data type and an `element` which can be any data type. It iterates through the elements of the list and if it finds an element that matches the given `element`, it returns True along with the index of that element in the list. If no matching element is found, it returns False along with -1 as the index value. The function accurately handles different cases where the `element` matches elements at different positions in the list.
