According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` can be any data type. So for the loop to execute, the list `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 0 and `x` is the first element in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` can be any data type, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list**
