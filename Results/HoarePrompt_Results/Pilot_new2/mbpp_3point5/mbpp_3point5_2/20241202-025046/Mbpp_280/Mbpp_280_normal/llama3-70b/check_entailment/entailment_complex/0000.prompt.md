You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list and elem is any data type.**
def func_1(arr, elem):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == elem:
            return True, i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `elem` is found in `arr`, the function returns True along with the index of the first occurrence of `elem` in the list. If `elem` is not found, the function returns False.
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False along with the index of -1 if `elem` is not found in list `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, a list `arr`, and an element `elem` of any data type. It iterates through the list to find the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is found, the function returns True along with the index of that element in the list. If `elem` is not found, the function returns False along with the index of -1. The functionality does not cover the cases mentioned in the annotations where `elem` is found at specific indices (0, 1, 2) as the function only returns the first occurrence.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
