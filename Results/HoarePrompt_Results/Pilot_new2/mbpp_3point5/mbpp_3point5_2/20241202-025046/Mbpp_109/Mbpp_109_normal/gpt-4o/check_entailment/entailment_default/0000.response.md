Correctness: **True**

Explanation: Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` takes in a binary string `binary_str` and the number of rotations `num_rotations`. It then rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times, calculates the integer value of the rotated string, and counts the number of times the integer value is odd. The function returns the count of odd integer values, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the provided examples also work correctly. Therefore, the code seems to be correct for all potential cases.
