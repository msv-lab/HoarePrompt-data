Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a binary string and the number of rotations as input, then rotates the binary string the given number of times and counts the number of times the integer value of the rotated string is odd. The program accurately tracks the count of odd values and returns it as required. Additionally, the program handles all potential cases where the number of rotations is a non-negative integer and the binary string consists of only '0's and '1's.
