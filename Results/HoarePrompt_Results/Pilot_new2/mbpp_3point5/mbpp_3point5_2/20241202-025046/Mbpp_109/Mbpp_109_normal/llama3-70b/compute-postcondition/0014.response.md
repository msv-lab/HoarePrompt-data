Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It then repeats the binary string `s` enough times to make its length greater than or equal to `n`. Next, it calculates the total number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s` modulo 2 and returns this count. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or where `n` is 0, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in these scenarios.**
