According to the code, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` has been rotated to the right by 1 position, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 2, and `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` in base 2. If the current value of `integer_value` is odd, then `count` is updated to 2. To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's. `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. `count` is 2. `binary_str` is the result of rotating the original `binary_str` to the right by 1 position. `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` in base 2. If the current value of `integer_value` after the rotation is odd, then `count` is updated to 2.**
