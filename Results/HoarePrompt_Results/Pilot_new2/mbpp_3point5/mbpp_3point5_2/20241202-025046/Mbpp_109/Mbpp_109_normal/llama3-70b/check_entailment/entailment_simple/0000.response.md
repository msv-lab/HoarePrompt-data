Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly finds the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. 

1. The program first ensures that the binary string `s` is repeated enough times to make its length greater than or equal to `n`.
2. It then iterates `n` times through the string `s`, each time creating a substring `temp` of length equal to the length of `s` starting from index `i`.
3. It counts the occurrences of '1' in each `temp` substring, and adds the result modulo 2 to the `count` variable.
4. Finally, it returns the total count of occurrences of '1' modulo 2, which represents the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating the binary string `n` times.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
