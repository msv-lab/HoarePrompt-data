#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string and n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a binary string repeated enough times to make its length greater than or equal to `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the total number of occurrences of '1' in `s` modulo 2
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of occurrences of '1' in string 's' modulo 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It then repeats the binary string `s` enough times to make its length greater than or equal to `n`. Next, it calculates the total number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s` modulo 2 and returns this count. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or where `n` is 0, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in these scenarios.
