Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`.
- It repeats the binary string `s` enough times to make its length greater than or equal to `n`.
- It then calculates the total number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s` modulo 2 and returns this count.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases, including handling scenarios where the input string is empty or where `n` is 0.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
