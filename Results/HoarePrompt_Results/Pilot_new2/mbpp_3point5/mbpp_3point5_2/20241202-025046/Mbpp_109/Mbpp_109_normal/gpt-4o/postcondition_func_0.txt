The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str`, which is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and `num_rotations`, a non-negative integer. It rotates the `binary_str` based on `num_rotations`, calculates the integer value of the rotated string, and counts the number of times the integer value is odd. The function then returns the count of odd integer values.
