Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is either 2 or 3, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` in base 2. If the current value of `integer_value` after the rotation is odd, then `count` is updated to 2 or remains 3 based on the condition***
