Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program takes a binary string `s` and an integer `n` as input. It then rotates the binary string `n` times and counts the number of numbers with an odd value. The program correctly handles the rotation of the binary string and keeps count of the numbers with an odd value. The logic of checking if the count of '1's in a substring is odd is also correct. The program works as expected for all potential cases, as it follows the problem description accurately.
