Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_data`, a minimum height `min_height`, and a minimum weight `min_weight`. The function then filters the `student_data` dictionary based on the condition that the student's height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and the student's weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The filtered dictionary is then returned.

This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function that filters students based on their height and weight being above the minimum values provided. The program meets the requirements and always does what the problem description asks for.
