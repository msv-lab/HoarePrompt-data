Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_dict`, representing student names and their corresponding height and weight tuples, as well as the minimum height and minimum weight. The function then filters the students based on whether their height and weight are above the minimum values.

The program correctly filters the students in the dictionary based on the provided minimum height and weight criteria. It uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate through the student_dict, checking if the height and weight of each student are greater than or equal to the minimum values. If they meet the criteria, the student is included in the returned dictionary.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and correctly filters out students based on their height and weight.
