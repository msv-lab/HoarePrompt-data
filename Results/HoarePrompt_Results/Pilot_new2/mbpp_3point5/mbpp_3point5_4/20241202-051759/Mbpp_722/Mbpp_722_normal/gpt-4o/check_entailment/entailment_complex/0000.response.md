Correctness: **True**

The program accurately filters the student dictionary based on the minimum height and weight requirements. It iterates over the items in the student dictionary, checks if the height and weight of each student are greater than or equal to the minimum height and weight provided, and creates a new dictionary with only the students that meet the criteria. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which specifies that the function should filter students with height and weight above the minimum thresholds.

The program will always return the correct result as it explicitly checks both height and weight conditions for each student in the dictionary. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
