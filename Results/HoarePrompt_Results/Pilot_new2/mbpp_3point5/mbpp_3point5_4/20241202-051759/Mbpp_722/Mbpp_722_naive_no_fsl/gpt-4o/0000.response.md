Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes a dictionary of student names as keys and tuples of float values (height, weight) as values, along with minimal height and minimal weight. It filters the students based on the condition that both height and weight are above the given minimum values. The program then returns a new dictionary containing only the students that meet the criteria.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios with different minimum height and weight values, and the program produces the expected output in each case. The filtering logic implemented in the program correctly identifies the students that satisfy the height and weight criteria, leading to the correct output. Therefore, based on the provided information and test cases, the program can be deemed correct.
