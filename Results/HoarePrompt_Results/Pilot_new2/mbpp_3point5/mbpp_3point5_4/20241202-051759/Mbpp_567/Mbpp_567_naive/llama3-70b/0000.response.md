Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The given function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by using a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the list and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element. This logic covers all potential cases where the list is not sorted, making the program correct.
