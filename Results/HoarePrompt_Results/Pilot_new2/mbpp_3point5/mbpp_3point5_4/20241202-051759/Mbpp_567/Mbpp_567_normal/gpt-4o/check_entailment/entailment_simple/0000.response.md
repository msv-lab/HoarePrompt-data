Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes a list as input and iterates through the list comparing each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, the function immediately returns False. If the loop completes without finding any such pair of elements, it returns True indicating that the list is sorted.

This implementation correctly follows the problem description as it checks whether the specified list is sorted or not. The function returns False if the list is not sorted and True if it is sorted. So, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
