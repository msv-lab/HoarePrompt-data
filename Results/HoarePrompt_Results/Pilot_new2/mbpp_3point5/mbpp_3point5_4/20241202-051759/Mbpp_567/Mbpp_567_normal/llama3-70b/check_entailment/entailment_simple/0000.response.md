Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function called `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input. It then uses a list comprehension along with the `all` function to check if all elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order. If this condition is met, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The program meets the problem description as it correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by verifying if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order. This approach covers all potential cases and correctly determines if the list is sorted.
