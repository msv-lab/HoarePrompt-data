Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided follows the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` iterates through the input list and checks if there exists an index `i` such that `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`. If such an index is found, the function returns False; otherwise, it returns True. The code properly handles the condition for a non-sorted list and correctly identifies whether the specified list is sorted or not. Additionally, the output hints also align with the code behavior, reinforcing the correctness of the program.
