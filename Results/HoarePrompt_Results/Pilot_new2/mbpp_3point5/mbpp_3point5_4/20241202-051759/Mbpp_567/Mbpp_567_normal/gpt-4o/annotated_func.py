#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.**
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes executing: `lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2. If there exists an index `i` such that `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, then the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns True.
    return True
    #The program returns True if there is no index i such that lst[i] is greater than lst[i + 1] in the list 'lst' of comparable elements with a length of at least 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list of comparable elements and iterates through the list to check if there exists an index i such that lst[i] is greater than lst[i + 1]. If such an index is found, the function returns False; otherwise, it returns True. The function assumes the list has a length of at least 2.
