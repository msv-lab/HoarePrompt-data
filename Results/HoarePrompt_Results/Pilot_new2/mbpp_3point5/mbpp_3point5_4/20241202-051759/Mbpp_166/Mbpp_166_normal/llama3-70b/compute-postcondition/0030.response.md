According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` is increased by the total number of valid XOR results, `i` is 2, and `j` is less than `len(nums)`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and it should still be less than the length of `nums`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number increased by 2, `i` is 2, `j` is such that `j + 1 < len(nums)`**
