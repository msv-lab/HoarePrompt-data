Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number and has been increased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the index before the last index of `nums`. The XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number.**
