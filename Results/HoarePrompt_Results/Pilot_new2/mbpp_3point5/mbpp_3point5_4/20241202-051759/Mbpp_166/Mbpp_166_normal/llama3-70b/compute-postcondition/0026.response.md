According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the valid range of indices in `nums`. In this case, `j` should be in the range `(i+1, len(nums))` for the loop to execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `len(nums)`, and `count` has been increased by the total number of valid XOR results**.
