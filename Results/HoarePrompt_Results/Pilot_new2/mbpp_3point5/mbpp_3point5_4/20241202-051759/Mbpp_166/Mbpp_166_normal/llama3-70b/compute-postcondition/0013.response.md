According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, `i` is 0, and `j` is the last index of `nums`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `j` needs to be decremented by 1 to iterate over the next element in `nums`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, `i` is 1, `j` is the index before the last index of `nums`**
