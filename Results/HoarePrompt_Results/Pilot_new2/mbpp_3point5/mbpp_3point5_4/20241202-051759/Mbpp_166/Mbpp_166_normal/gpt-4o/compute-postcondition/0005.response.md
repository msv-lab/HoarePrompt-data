The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. The function calculates and returns the sum of two values:
1. even_pairs: the count of pairs of even numbers in the list
2. odd_pairs: the count of pairs of odd numbers in the list

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst`, calculate the count of pairs of even and odd numbers in the list, and return the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs. The function does not consider pairs that consist of the same number.
