Output State: `nums` is a list of integers, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(nums)`, the loop has finished executing. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, `count` remains 0.
