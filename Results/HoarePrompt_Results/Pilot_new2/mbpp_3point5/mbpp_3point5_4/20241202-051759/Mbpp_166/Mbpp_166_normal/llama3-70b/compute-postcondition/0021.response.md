According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` has been increased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the last index of `nums`, and `count` has been increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number and has been increased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the last index of `nums` plus 1, and `count` has been increased by 1**
