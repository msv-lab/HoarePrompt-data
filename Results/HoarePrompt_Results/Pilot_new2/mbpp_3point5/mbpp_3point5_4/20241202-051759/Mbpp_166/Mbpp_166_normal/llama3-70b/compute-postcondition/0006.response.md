According to the code, the loop can execute one more time as long as `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the result of the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. The result of the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is an even number.**
