Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements. `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number increased by 1. `i` is 2, `j` is less than `len(nums)`, and `count` has been increased by the total number of valid XOR results. If the XOR result between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is an even number, the overall postcondition holds true.***
