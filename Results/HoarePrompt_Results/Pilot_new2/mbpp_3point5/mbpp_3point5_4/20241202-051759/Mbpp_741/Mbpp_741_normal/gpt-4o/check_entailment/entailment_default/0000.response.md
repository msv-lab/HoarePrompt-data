Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to follow the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes a string parameter `s` and checks if all characters in the string are the same as the first character. If the string is empty, it returns True. If there is at least one character different from the first character, it returns False. If all characters are the same as the first character, it returns True. The code initializes the `first_char` variable with the first character of the string and then iterates through each character in the string. If any character is found to be different from the `first_char`, the function returns False immediately. Otherwise, if all characters are the same, it returns True. The code covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description. The examples provided also seem to work correctly with the code logic. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct.
