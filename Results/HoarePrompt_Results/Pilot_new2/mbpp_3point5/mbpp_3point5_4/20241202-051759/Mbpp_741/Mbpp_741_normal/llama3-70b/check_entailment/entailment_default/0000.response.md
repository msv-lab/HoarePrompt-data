Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string parameter `s` and returns True if all characters in the string 's' are the same; otherwise, it returns False. 
- The code uses the set data structure to remove duplicate characters from the string and then checks if the length of the set is equal to 1, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.
- This approach works correctly for all cases as per the problem description. The function checks if all characters are identical and returns True only in that case.
- Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints confirm the expected behavior, the correctness of the code is True.
