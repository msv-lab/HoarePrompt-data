Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input. It then checks if the length of the set of characters in the string is equal to 1. If all characters in the string are the same, then the set will have a length of 1, and the function will return True. Otherwise, it will return False.

This implementation correctly checks whether all characters in the input string are the same, as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
