Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether all characters in the input string are the same or not. It first checks if the string is empty, and if so, it returns True. Then, it iterates through each character in the string and compares it to the first character. If any character is found to be different, it immediately returns False. If the loop completes without finding any different character, it returns True, indicating that all characters are the same.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and correctly determines if all characters in the string are the same.
