Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses the `any` function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is `None`. If any element is `None`, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct in checking if the given tuple has any `None` value or not.
