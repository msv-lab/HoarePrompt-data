Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist in the list. The function achieves this by using a generator expression within the `max` function to iterate over each sublist in the input list and calculate its length. Finally, the `max` function returns the length of the longest sublist.

The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly identifies and returns the length of the longest sublist in the input list. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function returns the length of the longest sublist in the list 'lists'. Since the code is simple and straightforward, and there are no potential cases identified where it would fail to follow the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct.
