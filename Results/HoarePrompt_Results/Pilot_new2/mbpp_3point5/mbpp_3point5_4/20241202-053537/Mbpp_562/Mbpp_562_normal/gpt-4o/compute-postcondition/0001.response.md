According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_of_lists. If the list_of_lists has at least 1 sublist, the loop can execute. At the start, max_length is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to list_of_lists containing at least 1 sublist and sublist is the first sublist in the list_of_lists.
State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, sublist is the first sublist in the list_of_lists, max_length is 0**
