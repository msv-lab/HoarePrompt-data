Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `elem` is the element to be searched in `arr`, `i` represents the index of the current element in the loop, and `x` is the current element in the loop. If the current element `x` is equal to the element `elem`, then the function returns True and the index `i` where the element `elem` is found in the list `arr`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the program state.***
