Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes in a list `arr` of elements and an element `elem` to be searched in the list. It then iterates through the list using a for loop and returns True along with the index `i` of the element `elem` if it is found in the list. If the element is not found, the function returns False along with -1 as default values. The function correctly handles the cases where the element is found at the beginning or somewhere in the middle of the list.**
