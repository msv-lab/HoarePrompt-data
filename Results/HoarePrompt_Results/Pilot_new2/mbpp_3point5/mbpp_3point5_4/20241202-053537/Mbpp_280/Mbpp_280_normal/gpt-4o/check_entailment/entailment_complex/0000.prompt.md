You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **arr is a list of elements and element is any data type.**
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `arr` is a list with elements, `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `element` in the list, and `value` is the element that is equal to `element`. If no element is equal to `element`, the program does not return anything.
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False and -1 if no element is equal to `element` in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `arr` consisting of elements of any data type and an `element` of any data type. It iterates through the list and if it finds the `element`, it returns True along with the index of the first occurrence of the `element` in the list. If the `element` is not found, the function returns False along with -1. The function does not return the value of the index as stated in the annotations for any case.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
