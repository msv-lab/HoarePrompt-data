According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If there are more elements in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the element to be searched in `arr`, and `i` represents the index of the current element in the loop. If the second element in `arr` is equal to `elem`, the program returns True and sets `i` to 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of `arr`, `elem`, `i`, and `x`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `arr` list must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `elem` is the element to be searched in `arr`, `i` represents the index of the current element in the loop, and `x` is the current element in the loop**
