Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description as it correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. It handles cases where the character is not found, only found once, or found more than once in the string. The logic used in the program ensures that the characters between the first and last occurrence of the character (excluding both occurrences) are removed, as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
