The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `c`. `s` is a string and `c` is a character. The function will return the string `s` with the characters between the first occurrence and the last occurrence of character `c` removed if such occurrences exist. If character `c` is not found in the string `s`, the function will simply return the original string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, and return the string `s` with characters between the first and last occurrences of `c` removed if they exist, or return the original string `s` if `c` is not found. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `c`. It returns the string `s` with characters between the first and last occurrences of `c` removed, if `c` is found. If `c` is not found, it returns the original string `s`.**
