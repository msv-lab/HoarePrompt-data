Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. If either `first_index` is equal to -1 or `last_index` is equal to -1 or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, then the current state of the variables satisfies the condition in the if statement.***
