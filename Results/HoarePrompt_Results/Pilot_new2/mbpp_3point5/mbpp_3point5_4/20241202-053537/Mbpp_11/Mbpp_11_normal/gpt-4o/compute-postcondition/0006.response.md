The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `ch`, which is a single character string. 

Case_1: The function returns the string `s`.

Case_2: The function returns the string `s` with the characters between the first occurrence of `ch` and the last occurrence of `ch` (excluding both occurrences) removed. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and return the original string `s` or the string `s` with characters between the first and last occurrence of `ch` removed.
