Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. If the `ch` character is found in the string `s` and occurs more than once, the function returns the original string `s` with the characters between the first and last occurrence of `ch` (excluding both occurrences) removed. If `ch` is not found, or if it occurs only once, the function simply returns the original string `s`.**
