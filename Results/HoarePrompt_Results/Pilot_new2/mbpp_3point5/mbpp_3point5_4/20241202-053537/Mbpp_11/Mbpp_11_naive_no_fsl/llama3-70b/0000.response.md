Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not remove the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. 

For example, if we have the input string "hello world" and the character "o", the program will return "hell world" instead of the expected output "ell wrld". 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
