Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and repeats the binary string `s` as necessary to match the length of `n`.
- It then calculates the count of occurrences of '1' in each substring of length equal to the length of `s`, and updates the count based on whether the count of '1' in the substring is odd.
- Finally, the function returns the total count.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly counts the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. The logic used in the code aligns with the problem description, and there are no edge cases identified where the code fails to meet the requirements.
