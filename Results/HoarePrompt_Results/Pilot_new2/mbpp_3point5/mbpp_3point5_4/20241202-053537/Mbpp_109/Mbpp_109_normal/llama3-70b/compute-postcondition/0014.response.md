Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It then repeats the binary string `s` as necessary to match the length of `n`, calculates the count of occurrences of '1' in each substring of length equal to the length of `s`, and updates the count based on whether the count of '1' in the substring is odd. Finally, the function returns the total count.**
