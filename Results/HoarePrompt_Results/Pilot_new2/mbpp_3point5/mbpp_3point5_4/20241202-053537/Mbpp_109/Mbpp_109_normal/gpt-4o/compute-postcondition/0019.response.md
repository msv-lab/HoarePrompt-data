The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of times the integer value obtained from rotating the binary string `num_rotations` times is odd, which is represented by the variable `count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, and then return the count of odd values obtained from rotating the binary string `num_rotations` times. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: binary_str and num_rotations. It returns the count of odd values obtained from rotating the binary string num_rotations times.**
