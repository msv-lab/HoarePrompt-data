Output State: **`s` is a binary string with len(s) > 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated to the value of `count + temp.count('1') % 2, `i` is 2, `temp` is equal to s[2:2 + len(s)], `temp` is equal to s[2:2 + len(s)], `count` is updated based on the count of '1' in `temp`, `temp` is equal to s[2:2 + len(s)], count is updated to the count of '1' in `temp` modulo 2**
