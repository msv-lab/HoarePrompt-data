Output State: binary_str is further rotated to the right by 1 position, num_rotations is greater than 2, count is adjusted based on the new integer_value, integer_value is the updated decimal representation of the rotated binary_str, integer_value is the decimal representation of binary_str. If integer_value % 2 == 1, count is increased by 1. 
After the code execution, binary_str is rotated to the right by 1 position, adjusting the values accordingly. 
Output State: **binary_str is the rotated version of the previous binary_str, num_rotations is greater than 2, count is adjusted based on the new integer_value, integer_value is the updated decimal representation of the new rotated binary_str, integer_value is the decimal representation of the new rotated binary_str. If integer_value % 2 == 1, count is increased by 1**
