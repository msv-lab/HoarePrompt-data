Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. 

For example:
- For the input '011001' and 6 rotations, the program should return 3, but it actually returns 2.
- For the input '11011' and 5 rotations, the program should return 4, but it actually returns 3.
- For the input '1010' and 4 rotations, the program should return 2, but it actually returns 1.

Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
