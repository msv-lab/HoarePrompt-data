#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers of the same length.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if (len(list1) != len(list2)) :
        raise ValueError('Both lists must be of the same length')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *list1 and list2 are lists of numbers of the same length. If the length of list1 is not equal to the length of list2, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. Otherwise, no changes occur to the lists.
    return [(x / y) for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a new list generated by dividing each element of list1 by the corresponding element of list2. If the length of list1 is not equal to the length of list2, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two lists of numbers of the same length, divides each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`, and returns a new list. If the lengths of the input lists are not the same, it raises a ValueError stating 'Both lists must be of the same length'. It performs element-wise division between the two lists and returns the result as a new list.
