Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two lists of numbers of the same length, divides each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`, and returns a new list. If the lengths of the input lists are not the same, it raises a ValueError stating 'Both lists must be of the same length'. It performs element-wise division between the two lists and returns the result as a new list. **
