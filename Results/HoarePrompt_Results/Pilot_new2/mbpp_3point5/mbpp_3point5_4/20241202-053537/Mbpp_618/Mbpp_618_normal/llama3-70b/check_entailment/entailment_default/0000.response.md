Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two lists of numbers of the same length, divides each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`, and returns a new list. The code also correctly checks if the lengths of the input lists are not the same and raises a ValueError stating 'Both lists must be of the same length'. 

Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function performs element-wise division between the two lists and returns the result as a new list. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios identified where the code would deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the code can be considered correct.
