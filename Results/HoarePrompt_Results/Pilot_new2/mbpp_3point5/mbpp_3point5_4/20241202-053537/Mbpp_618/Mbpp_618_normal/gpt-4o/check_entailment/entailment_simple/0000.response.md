Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists `list1` and `list2` of equal length containing integers or floating-point numbers. The program then uses list comprehension and the `zip` function to iterate over both lists simultaneously and divide each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. The function returns a new list containing the result of these element-wise divisions.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly divides two lists element-wise. It ensures that both lists are of the same length and only performs division on corresponding elements. Thus, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
