Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not completely remove lowercase substrings from the given string as described in the problem description. It only filters out uppercase characters and returns them, thereby missing the requirement to remove lowercase substrings. For example, if we consider the input 'PYTHon', the output should be 'PYTH', but the program will output 'PYTHo'. This inconsistency makes the program incorrect.
