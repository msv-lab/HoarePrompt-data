Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the input string by only joining the characters that are uppercase. The program iterates through each character in the input string and only includes the uppercase characters in the final output. This logic aligns with the problem description of removing lowercase substrings. Since there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
