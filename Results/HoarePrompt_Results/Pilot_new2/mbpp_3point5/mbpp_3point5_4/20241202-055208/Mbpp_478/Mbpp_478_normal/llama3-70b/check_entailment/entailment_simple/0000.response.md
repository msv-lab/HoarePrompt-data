Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes a string as input and then returns a new string containing only the uppercase letters from the original string. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for the removal of lowercase substrings from the given string. The program achieves this by filtering out characters that are not uppercase using a generator expression and the `isupper()` method. Therefore, the program is correct as it fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
