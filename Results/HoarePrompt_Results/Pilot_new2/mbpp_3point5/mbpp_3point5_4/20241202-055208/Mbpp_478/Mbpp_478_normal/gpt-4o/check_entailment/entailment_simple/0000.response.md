Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase letters from the original string `s`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from the given string. The program achieves this by using a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the input string `s` and only including the characters that are uppercase. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
