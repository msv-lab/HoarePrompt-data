Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the maximum of the two numbers using a ternary conditional expression. This matches the problem description of finding the maximum of two numbers. The program will always return the correct maximum value between `a` and `b`.
