Correctness: True

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly returns the maximum of two numbers using a conditional expression. The test cases provided cover positive numbers, negative numbers, and numbers with one being larger than the other, all of which return the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
