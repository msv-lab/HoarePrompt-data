Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns the maximum of the two numbers using the `max()` function. This implementation accurately follows the problem description of finding the maximum of two numbers. For all possible inputs, the program will correctly determine and return the maximum value, making it correct.
