The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list where each element is a sublist with exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the program returns two lists: `first_elements` and `second_elements`. `first_elements` contains the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, while `second_elements` contains the second element of each sublist. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of sublists, extract the first and second elements from each sublist, and return them in two separate lists.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list where each element is a sublist with exactly two elements. The program returns two lists, first_elements and second_elements, which contain the first and second elements of each sublist in list_of_lists respectively.**
