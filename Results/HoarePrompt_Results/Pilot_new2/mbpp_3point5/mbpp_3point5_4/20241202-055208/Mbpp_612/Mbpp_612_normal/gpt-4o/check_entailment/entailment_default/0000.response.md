Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, and correctly extracts the first and second elements of each sublist. It then returns two lists containing the first and second elements respectively. The code aligns with the problem description by specifically handling a list of lists with two elements in each sublist and correctly splitting them into first and second elements. The implementation is consistent with what is expected based on the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the code is working correctly by describing the expected behavior of the function, which is in line with the actual code provided. There are no edge cases identified that the code does not cover, and all examples provided seem to be handled correctly.
