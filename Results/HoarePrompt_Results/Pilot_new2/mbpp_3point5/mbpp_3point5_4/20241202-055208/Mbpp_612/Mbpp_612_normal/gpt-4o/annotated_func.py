#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list where each element is a sublist with exactly two elements.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    first_elements = [sublist[0] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    second_elements = [sublist[1] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
    #The program returns two lists, first_elements and second_elements, which contain the first and second elements of each sublist in list_of_lists respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list where each element is a sublist with exactly two elements. It then extracts the first and second elements of each sublist and returns two lists, first_elements and second_elements, respectively. The function correctly implements the extraction process as described by the annotations. No missing functionality or edge cases are identified in this context.
