Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in a complex number `c` and returns its absolute value (magnitude) and phase.
- The absolute value of a complex number represents its distance from the origin in the complex plane.
- The phase of a complex number represents the angle that the complex number makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane.
- The code correctly uses the `abs()` function from the `cmath` module to calculate the absolute value of the complex number and the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the phase.
- Since the code accurately performs the conversion of complex numbers to polar coordinates as described in the problem, it can be considered correct.
