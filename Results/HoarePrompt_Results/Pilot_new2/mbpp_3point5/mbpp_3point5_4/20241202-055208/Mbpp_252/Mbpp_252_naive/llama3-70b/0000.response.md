Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates using the `abs()` function to calculate the magnitude of the complex number and `cmath.phase()` to calculate the phase angle. The function does not have any logic errors and works as expected for all complex numbers.
