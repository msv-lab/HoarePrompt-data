Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it is missing the import statement for the `cmath` module. This will cause the program to throw a `NameError` when trying to execute the `cmath.polar()` function. 

To fix the program, the following import statement should be added at the beginning of the code:
```
import cmath
```
