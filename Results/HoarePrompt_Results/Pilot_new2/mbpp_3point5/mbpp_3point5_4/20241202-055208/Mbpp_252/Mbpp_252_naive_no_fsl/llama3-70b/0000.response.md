Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns the polar coordinates of the complex number. The function correctly calculates the magnitude (absolute value) of the complex number using `abs(c)` and the phase (angle) of the complex number using `cmath.phase(c)`. Since the program is handling the conversion of complex numbers to polar coordinates as described in the problem statement, and there are no potential cases identified where the program fails to do so, the correctness is deemed to be True.
