Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element, and then correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the number of occurrences of the given element in the tuple. This matches exactly with the problem description which asks for counting the occurrences of the element in the tuple.

Since the program returns the correct count of occurrences of the element in the tuple, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the Correctness is True.
