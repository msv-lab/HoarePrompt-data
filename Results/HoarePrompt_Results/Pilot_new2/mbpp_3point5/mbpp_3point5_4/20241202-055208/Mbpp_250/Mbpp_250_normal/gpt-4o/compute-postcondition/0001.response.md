The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup` and `element`. `tup` is a tuple and `element` is an element that may or may not be present in `tup`. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of occurrences of the `element` in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and return the number of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and returns the number of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`.**
