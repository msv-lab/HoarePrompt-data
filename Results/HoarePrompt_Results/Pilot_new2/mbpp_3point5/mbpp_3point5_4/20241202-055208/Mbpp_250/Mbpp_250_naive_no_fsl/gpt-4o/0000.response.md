Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the `count()` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The provided test cases cover different scenarios such as when the element is not present in the tuple (returns 0), when the element occurs multiple times in the tuple, and when the element occurs only once in the tuple. The program is able to correctly count the occurrences in each case. Therefore, the code is correct.
