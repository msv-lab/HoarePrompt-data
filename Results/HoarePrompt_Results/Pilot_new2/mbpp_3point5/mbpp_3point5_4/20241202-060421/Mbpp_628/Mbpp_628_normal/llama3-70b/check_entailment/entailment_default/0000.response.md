Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where all spaces are replaced by '%20'. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which requires the function to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The code is concise and utilizes the built-in `replace` method in Python to achieve the desired functionality. Additionally, there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code fails to handle. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases as per the problem description.
