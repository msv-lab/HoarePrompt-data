Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes an input string and uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces with '%20'. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The program consistently follows the problem description for all potential cases.
