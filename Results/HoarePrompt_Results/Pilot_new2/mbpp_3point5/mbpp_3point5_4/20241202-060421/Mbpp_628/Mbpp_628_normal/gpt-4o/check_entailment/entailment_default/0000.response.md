Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function named `func_1` that takes an input string and returns the string after replacing all spaces with '%20'. The code uses the built-in `replace` function in Python to achieve this, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the code has been tested with multiple test cases, and it correctly replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20' in each case. Therefore, based on the code logic and the provided examples, I believe the code is correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.
