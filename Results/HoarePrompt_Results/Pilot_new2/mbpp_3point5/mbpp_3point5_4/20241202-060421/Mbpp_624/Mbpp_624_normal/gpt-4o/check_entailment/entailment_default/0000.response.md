Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the input string using the `upper()` method. The code also includes assertions to test the function with different input strings such as 'person', 'final', and 'Valid', and the expected output is correctly provided for each assertion. The function directly implements the logic described in the problem description, which is to convert a given string to uppercase. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned where the code might fail to meet the requirements, and all provided examples seem to work correctly. Therefore, the code is correct.
