Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` iterates through the elements of the tuple and correctly returns the index of the first tuple element found in the tuple `tup` as per the problem description. 
- If no tuple is found, it returns the length of the tuple `tup` which is also consistent with the problem description.
- The function is not expected to return the index of a specific element or the second occurrence of an element, as mentioned in the output hints, but as per the provided problem description, the code is correct.
