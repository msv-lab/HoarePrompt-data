The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. 

Case_1: If the function is called with an element `elem`, it returns the index of that element within the tuple `tup`.

Case_2: If the function is called with the element 'elem', it returns the index of the second occurrence of that element within the tuple `tup`.

Case_3: If the function is called with an element `elem`, it returns the index of that element within the tuple `tup`.

Case_4: If the function is called without any specific element, it returns the length of the tuple `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and handle different cases based on the input elements. It can return the index of a specific element, the index of the second occurrence of an element, or the length of the tuple.
