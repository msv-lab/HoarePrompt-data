Correctness: **True**

The program implements the problem description accurately. It iterates through the elements of the tuple `tup` and returns the index of the first tuple element encountered. If no tuple element is found, it returns the length of the tuple `tup`. The annotations provided also explain the behavior of the code, which matches the intended functionality described in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
