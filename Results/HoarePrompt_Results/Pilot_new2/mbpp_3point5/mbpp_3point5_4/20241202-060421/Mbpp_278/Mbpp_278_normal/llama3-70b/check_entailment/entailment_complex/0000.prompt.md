You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    for elem in tup:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            return tup.index(elem)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the loop executes, it will return the index of the first tuple found in the tuple `tup`. If no tuple is found, it will return None. `tup` remains unchanged.
    return len(tup)
    #The program returns the length of the tuple `tup`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter. It iterates through the elements of the tuple and if it encounters a tuple element, it returns the index of that tuple element within the tuple `tup`. If no tuple is found, it returns the length of the tuple `tup`. However, the annotations mention cases such as returning the index of a specific element or the second occurrence of an element, which are not implemented in the actual code. Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is to return the index of the first tuple element found in the tuple `tup` or return the length of the tuple if no tuple element is present.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
