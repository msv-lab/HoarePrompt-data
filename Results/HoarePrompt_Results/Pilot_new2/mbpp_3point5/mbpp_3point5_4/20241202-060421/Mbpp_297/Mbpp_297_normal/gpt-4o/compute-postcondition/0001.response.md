According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 1 item, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, flat_list is empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the nested_list must have at least 1 item and the item is the first item in the nested_list structure.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 1 item, flat_list is an empty list, item is the first item in the nested_list**
