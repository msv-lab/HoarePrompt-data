According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since flat_list is empty before the loop starts, it does not affect the loop execution. For the loop to be executed, the element can be any element in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers, strings, or other nested lists.**
