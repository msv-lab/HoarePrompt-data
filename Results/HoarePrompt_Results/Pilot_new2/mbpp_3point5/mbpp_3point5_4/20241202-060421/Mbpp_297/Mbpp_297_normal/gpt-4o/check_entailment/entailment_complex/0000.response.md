Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list structure as input and recursively flattens the nested list to create a flat list containing all the elements of the nested list in a flat structure. The program correctly handles nested lists of any depth and returns the flat list, which aligns with the problem description. 

The program uses recursion to handle nested lists within the input list, ensuring that all elements are flattened into a single list. The program is structured in such a way that it correctly handles all nested structures and returns the desired flat list as specified in the problem description.
