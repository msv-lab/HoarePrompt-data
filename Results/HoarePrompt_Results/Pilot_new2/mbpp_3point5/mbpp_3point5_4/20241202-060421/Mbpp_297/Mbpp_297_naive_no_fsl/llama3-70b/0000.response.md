Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function recursively flattens a nested list structure by iterating through each element in the list. If the element is a list, it recursively calls the function on that element until a flat list is obtained. The function appends non-list elements to the flat_list. This logic covers all potential cases of nested lists and correctly flattens them. Hence, the program is correct.
