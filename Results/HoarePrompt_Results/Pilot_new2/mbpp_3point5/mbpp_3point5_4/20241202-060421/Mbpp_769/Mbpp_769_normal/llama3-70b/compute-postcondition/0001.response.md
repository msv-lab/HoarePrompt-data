The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. The function returns a sorted list containing unique elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. In other words, the function returns elements that are exclusive to either `list1` or `list2`, but not common to both lists.
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both.**
