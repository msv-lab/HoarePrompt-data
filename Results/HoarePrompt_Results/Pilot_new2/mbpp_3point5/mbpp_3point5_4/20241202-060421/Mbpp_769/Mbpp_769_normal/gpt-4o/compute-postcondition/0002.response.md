The `diff_elements` set is assigned the result of the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`. The symmetric difference contains elements that are in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both. Therefore, the `diff_elements` set now contains the elements that are in `set1` or `set2`, but not in both.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists; `set1` is a set containing the elements of `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the elements of `list2`; `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both.**
