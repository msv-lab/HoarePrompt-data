Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to correctly address the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input, finds the unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2 but not in both by using set operations to find the symmetric difference between the two lists, and then sorts the result. This aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implementing the logic as described. No edge cases or missing functionalities have been identified, and the code seems to be handling all potential cases as expected.
