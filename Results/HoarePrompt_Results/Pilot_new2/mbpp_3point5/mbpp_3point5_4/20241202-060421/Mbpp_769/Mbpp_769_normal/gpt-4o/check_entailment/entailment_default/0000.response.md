Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and creates a set of unique elements from each list. 
- It then finds the symmetric difference between the two sets and converts it to a list called `result_list`. 
- The elements in `result_list` are sorted based on their index in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. 
- The function returns this sorted list.
