#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
    result_list = list(diff_elements)
    result_list.sort(key=lambda x: (list1 + list2).index(x))
    return result_list
    #The program returns a list `result_list` containing elements from `diff_elements` sorted based on their index in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 takes two lists, list1 and list2, and creates a set of unique elements from each list. It then finds the symmetric difference between the two sets and converts it to a list called result_list. The elements in result_list are sorted based on their index in the combined list of list1 and list2. The function returns this sorted list.
