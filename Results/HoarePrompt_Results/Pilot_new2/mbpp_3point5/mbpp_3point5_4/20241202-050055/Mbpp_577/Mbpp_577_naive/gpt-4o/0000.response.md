Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly find the last digit of the factorial of a given number for all potential cases. For example, when n is greater than or equal to 5, the program should return 0 as the last digit of the factorial. However, the program incorrectly returns 0 for all values of n greater than or equal to 5. This is because the condition `if n >= 5:` should be `if n > 5:` in order to accurately identify when the factorial ends in 0.
