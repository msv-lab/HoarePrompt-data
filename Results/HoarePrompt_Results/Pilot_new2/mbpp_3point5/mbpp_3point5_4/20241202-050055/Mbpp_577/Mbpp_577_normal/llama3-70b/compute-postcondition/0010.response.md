The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The function has multiple return points based on the value of `n`.

In Case 1, if `n` is less than 2, the function returns the current value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer.

In Case 2, if `n` is either 2 or 3, the function returns the value of `n`.

In Case 3, if `n` is 4, the function returns the integer 4.

In Case 4, if none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return different values based on the conditions specified for each case.
