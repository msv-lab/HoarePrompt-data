According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same, as it only needs to be at least 1.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `factorial` is the product of all numbers from 1 to `i`, `i` is 2**
