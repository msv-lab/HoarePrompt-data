According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer less than 5 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 1. Additionally, since the loop iterates starting from 1, `i` should be set to 1 at the beginning.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `factorial` is 1, `i` is 1**
