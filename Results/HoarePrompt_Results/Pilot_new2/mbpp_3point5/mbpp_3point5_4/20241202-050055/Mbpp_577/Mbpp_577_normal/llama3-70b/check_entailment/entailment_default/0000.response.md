Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not accurately find the last digit in the factorial of a given number as described in the problem statement. The code only returns specific values for certain input values and does not actually calculate the factorial or find the last digit. The output hints do not agree with the code as well, as they describe a scenario where the function should calculate the factorial, which the code does not do. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
