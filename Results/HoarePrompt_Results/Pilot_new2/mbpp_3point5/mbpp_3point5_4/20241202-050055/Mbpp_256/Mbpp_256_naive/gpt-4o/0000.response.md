Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number 'n'. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes method to mark all non-prime numbers and then counts the remaining prime numbers. The program has been validated with test cases for 5, 10, and 100, and it produces the expected output for each case. Additionally, the program handles the edge case of n <= 2 by returning 0, as there are no prime numbers less than 2. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the successful validation of test cases, the program is correct.
