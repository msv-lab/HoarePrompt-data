Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It initializes a list of booleans to keep track of whether each number is prime or not, and then iterates through the numbers starting from 2 to mark the multiples of each prime number as not prime. The function returns the sum of all the True values in the is_prime list, which corresponds to the number of prime numbers less than the input number. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the program.
