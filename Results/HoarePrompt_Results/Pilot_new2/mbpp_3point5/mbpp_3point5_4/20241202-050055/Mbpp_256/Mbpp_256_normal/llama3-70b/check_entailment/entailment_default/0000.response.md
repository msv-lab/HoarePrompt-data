First, let's analyze the code based on the problem description and see if there are any potential edge cases that the code might not be handling:

Looking at the code for `func_1`:
- The function is supposed to calculate the number of prime numbers between 2 and n.
- It iterates from 2 to n-1, incrementing a count variable for each prime number found.
- The function does not include a check for when n is less than 2, which could be considered an edge case.

Looking at the code for `is_prime`:
- The function determines if a given number is prime by checking if it's divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number.
- It correctly handles cases where the number is less than 2 and returns False.

Now, let's see if the output descriptions agree with the code:

- The output descriptions accurately describe the functionalities of both functions and what they are expected to do.
- The output descriptions do not point out any potential edge cases that are not handled by the code.

Based on the analysis:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to follow the problem description correctly. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of prime numbers between 2 and n, and the `is_prime` function correctly determines if a number is prime. The code does not miss out on any edge cases, and the output descriptions align with the code's functionalities. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
