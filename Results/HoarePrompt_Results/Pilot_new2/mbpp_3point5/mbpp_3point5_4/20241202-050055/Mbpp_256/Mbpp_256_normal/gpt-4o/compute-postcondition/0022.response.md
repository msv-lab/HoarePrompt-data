Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is equal to int(n**0.5) + 1, i * i is greater than or equal to n, j is equal to i * i, and all elements in the range(i * i, n, i) have been updated to False in is_prime if is_prime[i] is true.**
