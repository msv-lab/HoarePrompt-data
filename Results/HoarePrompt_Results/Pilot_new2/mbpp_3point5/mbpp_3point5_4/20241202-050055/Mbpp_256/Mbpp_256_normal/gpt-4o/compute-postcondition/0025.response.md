According to the code, the loop can execute if the range in `for j in range(i * i, n, i)` is valid. This means that `i * i` must be less than `n` and `i` must be a valid divisor. Before the loop starts, `i` is the next value after 3, so for the loop to execute `i` must be at least 3. Also, `j` is initialized to the new value of `i * i`, so `j` must be equal to `i * i`. Lastly, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, so `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values, is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is at least 3, j is equal to i * i, i * i is less than n**
