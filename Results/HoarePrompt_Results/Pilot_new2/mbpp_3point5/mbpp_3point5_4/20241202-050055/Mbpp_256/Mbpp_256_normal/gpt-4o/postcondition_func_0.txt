The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. For `n` greater than 2, the function generates a list `is_prime` where elements represent whether the index is a prime number or not. It marks composite numbers as False and prime numbers as True. The function then returns the sum of boolean values in the list `is_prime`, excluding the first two elements.
