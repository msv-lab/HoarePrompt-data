According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2. The loop will iterate from 2 to the square root of `n`. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, `i` is 2**
