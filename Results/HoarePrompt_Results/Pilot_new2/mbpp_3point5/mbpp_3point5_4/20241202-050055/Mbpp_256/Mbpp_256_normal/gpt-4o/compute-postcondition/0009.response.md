According to the code, the loop can execute as long as j is less than n. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, i * i is less than n, and j is initialized to i * i. So for the loop to execute one more time, j should be less than n. 
State: **n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is 2, i * i is less than n, and j is initialized to i * i. is_prime[j] is False, j is less than n.**
