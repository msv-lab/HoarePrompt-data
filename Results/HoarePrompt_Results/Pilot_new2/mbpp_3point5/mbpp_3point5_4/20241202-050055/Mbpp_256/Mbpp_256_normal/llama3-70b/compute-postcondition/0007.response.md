According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num` and `i`. If `i` is less than the square root of `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer larger than or equal to 2 and not divisible by 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and it should be less than the square root of `num`.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer larger than or equal to 2, `i` is 3. `num` is not divisible by 2**
