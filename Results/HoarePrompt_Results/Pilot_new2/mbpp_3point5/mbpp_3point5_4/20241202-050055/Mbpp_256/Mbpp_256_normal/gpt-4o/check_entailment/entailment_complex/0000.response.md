Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given number. The program first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the program generates a list `is_prime` where each element represents whether the index is a prime number or not. It then marks composite numbers as False and prime numbers as True. Finally, the program returns the sum of the boolean values in the list `is_prime`, excluding the first two elements.

The program correctly follows the problem description as it accurately counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`. The explanation provided in the annotations also aligns with the intended functionality of the program.
