Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The function takes in non-negative numbers for the radius and height, which aligns with the problem description. The code includes assertions to check the correctness of the function with specific test cases, and these test cases also match the expected results based on the volume formula for a cylinder. The code seems to be handling all potential cases correctly, as it follows the problem description accurately.
