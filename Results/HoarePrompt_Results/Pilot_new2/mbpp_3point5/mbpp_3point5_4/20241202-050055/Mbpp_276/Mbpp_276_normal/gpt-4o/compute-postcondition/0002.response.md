The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, the program calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius * height` and returns the result. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the volume of a cylinder calculated using the provided formula. 
Functionality: **The function accepts non-negative numbers radius and height, calculates the volume of a cylinder using math.pi * radius * height, and returns the result.**
