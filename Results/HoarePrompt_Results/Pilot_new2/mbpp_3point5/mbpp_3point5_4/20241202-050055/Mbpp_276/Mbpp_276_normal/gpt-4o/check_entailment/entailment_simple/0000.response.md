Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by taking in the radius and height of a cylinder and returning the volume calculated using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. Since the program specifically states that radius and height are non-negative numbers, it ensures that the calculation is done correctly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
