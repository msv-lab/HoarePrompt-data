#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.**
def func_1(radius, height):
    volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    return volume
    #The program returns the volume of a cylinder, which is calculated as `math.pi * radius * height` where radius and height are non-negative numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts non-negative numbers radius and height, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula math.pi * radius
