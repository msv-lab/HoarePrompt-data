Correctness: **True**

The annotated program accurately describes the function `func_1` as taking in the radius and height of a cylinder, calculating the volume using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, and returning the calculated volume. The program aligns perfectly with the provided problem description, as it correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the given radius and height.
