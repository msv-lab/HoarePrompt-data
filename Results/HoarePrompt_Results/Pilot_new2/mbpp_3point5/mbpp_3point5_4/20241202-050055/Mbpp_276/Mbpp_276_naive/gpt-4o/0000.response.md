Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The program has been verified with multiple test cases using `assert` statements and it passes all the test cases with the given expected values within the specified relative tolerance. Hence, the program is correct for all potential cases.
