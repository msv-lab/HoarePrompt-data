Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the original list followed by the elements of the tuple. The function correctly converts the tuple to a list using the `list()` function and then concatenates it with the original list using the `+` operator. The test cases provided also verify that the function works as expected by adding the tuple elements to the end of the list. Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is True.
