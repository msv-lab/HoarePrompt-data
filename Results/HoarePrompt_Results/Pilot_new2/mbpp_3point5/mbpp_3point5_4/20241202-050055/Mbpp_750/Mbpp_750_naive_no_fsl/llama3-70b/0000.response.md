Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input and returns a new list that contains all the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tup`. The code achieves this by converting the tuple `tup` to a list using the `list()` function and then concatenating it to the original list `lst` using the `+` operator. This implementation correctly adds the given tuple to the given list as per the problem description. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
