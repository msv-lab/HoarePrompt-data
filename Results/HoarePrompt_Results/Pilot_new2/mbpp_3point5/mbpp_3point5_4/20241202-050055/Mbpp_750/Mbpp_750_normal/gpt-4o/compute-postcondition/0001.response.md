The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `lst` and `tpl`. `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list that contains all elements from list `lst` followed by all elements from tuple `tpl`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to concatenate the elements of the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tpl` and return a new list containing all elements in sequence. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that contains all elements from the list followed by all elements from the tuple.**
