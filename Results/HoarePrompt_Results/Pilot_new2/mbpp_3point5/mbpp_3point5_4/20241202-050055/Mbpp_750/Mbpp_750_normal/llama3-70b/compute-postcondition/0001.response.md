The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `tup`, which is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns the concatenation of the list `lst` and the elements of the tuple `tup` converted to a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return the concatenation of `lst` with the elements of `tup` converted to a list.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, returns the concatenation of `lst` with the elements of `tup` converted to a list.**
