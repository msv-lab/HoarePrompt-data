Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` accurately follows the problem description. The function takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, then returns the concatenation of the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tup` converted to a list. This operation simply merges the elements of the list and the tuple, which is correctly implemented in the code. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in this operation, and the code aligns with the given problem description.
