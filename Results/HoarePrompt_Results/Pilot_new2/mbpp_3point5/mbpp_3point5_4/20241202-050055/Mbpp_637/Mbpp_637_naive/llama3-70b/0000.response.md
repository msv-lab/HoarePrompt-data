Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price to determine if there is no profit and no loss. This logic aligns with the problem description, as having the cost price equal to the selling price indicates no profit and no loss. There are no edge cases or scenarios where this logic would not hold true, so the program is correct.
