Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function func_1 that takes in two non-negative integer parameters, cost_price and selling_price, and simply checks if they are equal. The function then returns True if they are equal, and False otherwise. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, and for all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, the code will provide the correct output. The output hints also confirm that the function adheres to the given specifications. Therefore, the code is correct.
