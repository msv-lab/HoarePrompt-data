#State of the program right berfore the function call: cost_price and selling_price are non-negative integers.**
def func_1(cost_price, selling_price):
    return cost_price == selling_price
    #The program returns True if the cost_price is equal to the selling_price, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price` and returns True if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`. Otherwise, it returns False. The function does not account for cases where cost_price or selling_price are negative integers, which could potentially be considered missing functionality.
