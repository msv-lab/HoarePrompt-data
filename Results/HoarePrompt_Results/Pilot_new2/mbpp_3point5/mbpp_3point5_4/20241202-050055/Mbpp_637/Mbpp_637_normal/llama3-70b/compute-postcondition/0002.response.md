Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price` and returns True if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`. Otherwise, it returns False. The function does not account for cases where cost_price or selling_price are negative integers, which could potentially be considered missing functionality.**
