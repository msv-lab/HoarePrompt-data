Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string, it does not handle the case where the character appears only once in the string. According to the problem description, in this case, the original string should be returned, but the program does not account for this scenario. Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
