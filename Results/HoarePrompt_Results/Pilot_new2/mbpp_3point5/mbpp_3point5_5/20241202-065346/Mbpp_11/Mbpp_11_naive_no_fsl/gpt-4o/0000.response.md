Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the input string. It first finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of the character using the `find()` and `rfind()` functions. If either the first_index or last_index is -1, it means that the character is not present in the string, so it returns the input string. If the first_index is the same as the last_index, it means there is only one occurrence of the character, so it also returns the input string. Otherwise, it slices the string to remove the first and last occurrences of the character and returns the modified string. The provided test cases pass successfully, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as described.
