Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it only removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. However, the problem description requires removing both the first and last occurrences of the character.

For example, if we consider the input string "hello", with the character 'l', the expected output should be "heo". But the program will output "heo" which does not remove the last occurrence of 'l'.
