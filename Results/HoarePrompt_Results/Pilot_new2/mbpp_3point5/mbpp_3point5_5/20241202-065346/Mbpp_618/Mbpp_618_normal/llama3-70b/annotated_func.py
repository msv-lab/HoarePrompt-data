#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if (len(list1) != len(list2)) :
        raise ValueError('Both lists must be of the same length')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length. If the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal, there is no change in the lists.
    return [(x / y) for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2. Both list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length. If the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal, there is no change in the lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two lists of numbers with the same length. It then returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2. If the lengths of the input lists are not equal, the function raises a ValueError stating that both lists must be of the same length.
