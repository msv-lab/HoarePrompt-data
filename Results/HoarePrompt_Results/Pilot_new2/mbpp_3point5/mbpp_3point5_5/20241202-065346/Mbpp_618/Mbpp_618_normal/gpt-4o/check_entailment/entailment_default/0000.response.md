Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list containing the element-wise division of the corresponding elements in `list1` and `list2`. The code correctly performs the division operation using list comprehension and the `zip` function to pair elements from the input lists.

The output hints also support this by stating that the function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers with the same length, and then returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. This aligns with the code provided, confirming that the code follows the problem description for all potential cases.
