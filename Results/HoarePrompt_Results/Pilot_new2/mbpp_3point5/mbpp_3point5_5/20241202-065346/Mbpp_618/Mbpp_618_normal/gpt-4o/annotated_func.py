#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return [(a / b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a list of results obtained by dividing each element in list1 by the corresponding element in list2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers with the same length. It then returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. The function performs element-wise division on the input lists.
