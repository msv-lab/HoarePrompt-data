Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function iterates through each sublist in the input list and calculates the length of each sublist. It then returns the maximum length of all the sublists. This logic is in line with the problem description of finding the length of the longest sublist. The function correctly handles all potential cases and there are no input scenarios provided where the function would fail to find the length of the longest sublist. Therefore, the program is correct.
