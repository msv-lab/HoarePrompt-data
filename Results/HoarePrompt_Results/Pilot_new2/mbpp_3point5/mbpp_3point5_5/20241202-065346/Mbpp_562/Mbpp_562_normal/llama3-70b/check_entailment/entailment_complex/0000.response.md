Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist in the input list of lists. This matches the problem description, which requires finding the length of the longest sublist.

The program achieves this by using a generator expression within the `max` function to calculate the length of each sublist in the input list and then returning the maximum of these lengths. This approach correctly identifies the longest sublist in the list of lists and returns its length, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
