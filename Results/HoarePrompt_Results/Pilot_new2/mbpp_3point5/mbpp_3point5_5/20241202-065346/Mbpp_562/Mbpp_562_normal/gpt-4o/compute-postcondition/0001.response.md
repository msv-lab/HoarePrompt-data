According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_of_lists. If the list has at least 1 sublist, the loop can execute. At the start, max_length is 0, which does not affect the loop execution. For the loop to execute, the list_of_lists must have at least 1 sublist, and max_length is 0.
State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, max_length is 0**
