Correctness: **True**

This program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist within a list of lists. It achieves this by using a generator expression to iterate through each sublist in the input list and returning the maximum length found. This approach aligns with the problem description of finding the length of the longest sublist. Since the program consistently returns the correct result for any input list of lists, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
