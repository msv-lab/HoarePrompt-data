Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly defines a function named func_1 that takes a parameter lists, which is a list of lists. It then uses a generator expression to iterate through each sublist in the input list and returns the maximum length of those sublists. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for the length of the longest sublists in the list of lists. Since the code covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of the description, the correctness is True.
