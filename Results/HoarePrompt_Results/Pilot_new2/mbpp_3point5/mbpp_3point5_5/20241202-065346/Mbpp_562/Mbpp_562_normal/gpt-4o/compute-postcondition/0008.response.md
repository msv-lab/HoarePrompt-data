According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list_of_lists. If there are more sublists present in the list_of_lists, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, list_of_lists is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 3 sublists present in the list_of_lists.
State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists**
