The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `arr` and `elem`. `arr` is a list and `elem` can be any valid Python data type. 

There are multiple cases for the return value:
- Case 1: The program returns True and the value of `i`.
- Case 2: The program returns True and the value of `i`, which is 1.
- Case 3: The program returns True and the value of `i`, which is 2.
- Case 4: The program returns False and -1, as the loop does not execute and `elem` is not found in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `elem`, and return different values based on whether the element `elem` is found in the list `arr` and at which index it is found. If the element is not found, it returns False and -1.
