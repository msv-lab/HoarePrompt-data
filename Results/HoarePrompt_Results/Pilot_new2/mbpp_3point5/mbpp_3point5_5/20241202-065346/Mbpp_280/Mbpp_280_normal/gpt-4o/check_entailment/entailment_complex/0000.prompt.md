You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list and element is any data type.**
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will check each element in the list `arr` to see if it is equal to the specified `element`. If the `element` is found, the loop will return `True` and the index of that element. If the `element` is not found in the list, the loop will return `None`.
    return False, -1
    #The loop will return False and -1 if the specified `element` is not found in the list `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of any data type, and `element`, which can be any data type. It searches for the specified `element` in the list `arr` and returns True along with the index of the element if found. If the element is not present in the list, it returns False along with -1 as the index. The actual code provided does not fully match the annotations as it does not return `None` if the element is not found, but instead returns False and -1. The function does not cover cases where the specified `element` is found at index 0, 1, or 2 as mentioned in the annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
