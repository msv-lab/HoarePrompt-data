Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements where `element` is the second element, `index` is 1, and `value` is not equal to `element`. If `value` is equal to `element`, the function returns True and sets `index` to 1. Otherwise, if `value` is not equal to `element`, the function returns None.***
