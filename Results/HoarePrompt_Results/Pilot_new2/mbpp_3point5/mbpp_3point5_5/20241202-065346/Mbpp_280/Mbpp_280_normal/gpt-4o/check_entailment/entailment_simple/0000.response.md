Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns True along with the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns False along with -1. This matches the requirements of the problem description, making the program correct.
