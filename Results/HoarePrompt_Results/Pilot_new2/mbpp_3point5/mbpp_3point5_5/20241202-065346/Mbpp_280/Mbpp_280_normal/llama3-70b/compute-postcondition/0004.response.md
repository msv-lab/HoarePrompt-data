According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, `elem` is any valid python data type, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list and the first element of `arr` is not equal to `elem`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 elements, and `i` should be 1, and `x` should be the second element in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is any valid python data type, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list.**
