Postcondition: ***`binary_str` represents a binary number after one more rotation, `num_rotations` remains the same, `count` is updated to the previous value plus 1 if `integer_value` % 2 == 1. The `integer_value` becomes the integer value of the updated `binary_str` converted from binary representation to decimal.***
