According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the binary_str is a string representing a binary number, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, and count is 0. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `num_rotations` must be greater than 0.
State: **binary_str is a string representing a binary number, num_rotations is a non-negative integer greater than 0, count is 0**
