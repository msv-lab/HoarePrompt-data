Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, repeats the binary string to match the length of `n`, and then rotates the string `n` times. The program then counts the total number of '1's in the rotated string, takes the remainder of the division by 2, and returns the count of odd numbers.

The program ensures that it counts the odd values after rotating the binary string the given number of times, as required by the problem description. Hence, the program is correct and meets the requirements stated in the problem description.
