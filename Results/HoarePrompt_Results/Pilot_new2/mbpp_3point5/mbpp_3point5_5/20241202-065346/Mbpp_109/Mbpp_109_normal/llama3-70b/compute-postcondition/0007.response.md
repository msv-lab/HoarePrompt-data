Output State: **`s` is a binary string repeated to match the length of `n`, `count` is the remainder of the division of the number of '1's in `temp` by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `temp` is a substring of `s` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + len(s)`, `temp` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + len(s)`, `count` is incremented by the number of '1's in `temp` modulo 2**
