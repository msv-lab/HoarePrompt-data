The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `n`. Parameter `s` is a binary string, and parameter `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the program returns the remainder of the division of the total number of '1's in the binary string `s` by 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the remainder of the division of the total number of '1's in the binary string `s` by 2.
