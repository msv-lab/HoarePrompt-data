Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes a binary string `binary_str` and the number of rotations `num_rotations` as input. It then rotates the binary string by moving the last digit to the beginning for the specified number of rotations. After all iterations, it counts the number of times the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` is odd and returns that count. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.
