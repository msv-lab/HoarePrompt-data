The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a string representing a binary number, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. After all iterations of the loop have executed, the program returns the number of times the integer value of `binary_str` is odd. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, and return the number of times the integer value of `binary_str` is odd after all iterations.
