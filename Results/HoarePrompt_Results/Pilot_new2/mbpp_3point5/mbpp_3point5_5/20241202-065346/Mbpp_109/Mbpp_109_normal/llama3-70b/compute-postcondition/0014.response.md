Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It repeats the binary string `s` to match the length of `n`, then calculates the total number of '1's in the repeated string and returns the remainder of dividing that total by 2.** 

The function does not cover potential edge cases such as an empty string as input or a scenario where the binary string contains characters other than '0' and '1'.
