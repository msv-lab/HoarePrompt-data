Correctness: True

Explanation: The program uses a list comprehension to check if each element in the list is less than or equal to the next element, thus verifying if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The use of `all()` ensures that this condition holds true for all pairs of consecutive elements in the list. Therefore, the program correctly checks whether the specified list is sorted or not.
