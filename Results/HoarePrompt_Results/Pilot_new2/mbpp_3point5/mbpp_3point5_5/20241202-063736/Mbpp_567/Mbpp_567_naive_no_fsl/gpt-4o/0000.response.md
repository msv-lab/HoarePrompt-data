Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the list is not sorted in ascending order but has a single element that is out of order. For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 9, 17], the program would incorrectly return True, even though the list is not sorted.
