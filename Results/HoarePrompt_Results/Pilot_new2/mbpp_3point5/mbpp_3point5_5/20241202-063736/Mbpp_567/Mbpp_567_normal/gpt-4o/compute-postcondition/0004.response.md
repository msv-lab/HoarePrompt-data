According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 2 elements, and the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
