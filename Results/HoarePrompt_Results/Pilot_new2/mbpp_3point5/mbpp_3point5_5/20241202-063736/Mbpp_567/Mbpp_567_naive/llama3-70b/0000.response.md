Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program iterates through the given list and checks whether each element is less than or equal to the next element. If this condition holds true for all elements in the list except the last one, then the list is considered to be sorted. The logic implemented in the code correctly checks if a specified list is sorted or not. Additionally, it covers all potential cases where the specified list may or may not be sorted.
