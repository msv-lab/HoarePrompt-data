Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_dict`, minimum height `min_height`, and minimum weight `min_weight`. It then filters the students based on the condition that their height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. This matches the problem description exactly. The program correctly creates a new dictionary with only the students that meet the height and weight criteria, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
