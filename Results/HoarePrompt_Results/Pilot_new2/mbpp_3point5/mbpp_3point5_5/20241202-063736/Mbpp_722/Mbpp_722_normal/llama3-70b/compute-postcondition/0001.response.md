The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_data` is a dictionary where keys are student names and values are tuples of floats (student_height, student_weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimal height and weight respectively. After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing only the student names and corresponding tuples of height and weight from the `student_data` dictionary where both the height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `student_data`, along with `min_height` and `min_weight` floats. It returns a dictionary containing only the student names and corresponding tuples of height and weight from the `student_data` dictionary where both the height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.**
