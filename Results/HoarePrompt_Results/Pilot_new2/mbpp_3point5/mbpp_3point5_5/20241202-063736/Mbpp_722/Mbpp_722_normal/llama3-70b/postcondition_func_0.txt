The function func_1 accepts a dictionary `student_data`, along with `min_height` and `min_weight` floats. It then filters the student data based on the condition that both the height and weight of the students are greater than or equal to `min_height` and `min_weight` respectively. The function returns a dictionary containing only the student names and corresponding tuples of height and weight that meet the specified criteria.
