Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_dict` containing student names as keys and height, weight tuples as values, along with `min_height` and `min_weight` as the minimum height and weight thresholds.
- The function then filters out students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, and returns a new dictionary with only these selected students.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case as it filters out students based on both height and weight thresholds, as specified in the problem description.
- All the assertions provided in the code test cases pass, confirming that the code is correct for the given problem description.
