Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The given program correctly checks if the given tuple has any `None` value by iterating through each item in the tuple and returning `True` if it encounters a `None` value. If no `None` value is found, it returns `False`. The provided test cases cover scenarios where the tuple contains `None` values and where it does not, ensuring that the program works as expected for all potential cases.
