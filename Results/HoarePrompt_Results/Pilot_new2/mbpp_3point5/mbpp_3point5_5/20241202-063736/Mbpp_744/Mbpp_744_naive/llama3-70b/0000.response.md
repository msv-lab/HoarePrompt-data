Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a tuple as input and uses the `any` function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is `None`. This implementation follows the problem description accurately and covers all potential cases where the tuple may have a `None` value. Since the program checks for `None` values in the tuple correctly, it can be considered correct.
