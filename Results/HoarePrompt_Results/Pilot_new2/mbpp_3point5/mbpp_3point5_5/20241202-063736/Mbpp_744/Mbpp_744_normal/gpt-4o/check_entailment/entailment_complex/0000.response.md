Correctness: **True**

The program checks if all items in the given tuple are `None`. If any item in the tuple is `None`, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to check if the given tuple has any `None` value or not. The annotations provided also accurately describe the behavior of the function.
