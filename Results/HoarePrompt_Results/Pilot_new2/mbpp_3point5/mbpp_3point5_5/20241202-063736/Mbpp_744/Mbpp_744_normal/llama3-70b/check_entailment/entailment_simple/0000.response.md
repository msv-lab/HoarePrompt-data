Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple as input and checks if any element in the tuple is `None`. It uses the `any` function along with a generator expression to iterate over each element in the tuple and return `True` if any element is `None`, otherwise it returns `False`. This implementation correctly aligns with the problem description of checking if the given tuple has any `None` value or not.
