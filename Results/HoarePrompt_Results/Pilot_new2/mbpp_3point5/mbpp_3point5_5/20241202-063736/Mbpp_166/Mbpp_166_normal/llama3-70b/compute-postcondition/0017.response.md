Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0. `count` is the total number of pairs (i, j) where i is less than the length of `nums` and j is greater than i such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number. `i` is less than the length of `nums`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`. Additionally, after the execution of the if else block, the count variable has been updated based on the conditions specified in the if part.***
