According to the code, the loop can execute as long as j is within the range of i+1 to the length of `nums`. This means j can have values starting from i+1 up to the length of `nums`. Since the condition specifies that `j` is equal to `i + 1`, we can infer that `i` can go up to the second last index in `nums` to satisfy this condition.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `count` is the total number of pairs (i, j) where i is less than the length of `nums` and j is greater than i such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, `i` is less than the length of `nums`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`**.
