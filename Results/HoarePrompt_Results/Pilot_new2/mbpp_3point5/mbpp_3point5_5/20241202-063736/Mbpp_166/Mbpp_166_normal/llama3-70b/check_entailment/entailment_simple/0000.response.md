Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. The nested loops iterate over all valid pairs of indices `i` and `j` in the `nums` list, then check if the XOR of the corresponding elements in those indices results in an even number. If it does, the `count` variable is incremented. The function then returns the total count of such pairs, which fulfills the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.
