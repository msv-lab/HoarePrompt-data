According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `count` is increased by 1, `i` is less than the length of `nums`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the length of `nums` and incremented by 1. Also, the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` should still result in an even number.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `count` is increased by 2, `i` is less than the length of `nums`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`. The bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number.**
