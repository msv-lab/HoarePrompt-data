According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `count` is increased by 3, `i` is less than the length of `nums`, and `j` is equal to `i + 2` resulting in an even number when XORed. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than the length of `nums` and `i` should be less than the length of `nums`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `count` is increased by 3, `i` is less than the length of `nums`, `j` is equal to `i + 3**.
