#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.**
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
    #The program returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs, where even_pairs is the product of even_count and (even_count - 1) divided by 2, and odd_pairs is the product of odd_count and (odd_count - 1) divided by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `lst`, calculates the number of even and odd elements in the list, and then returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs. Even_pairs is calculated as the product of the count of even elements and (count of even elements - 1) divided by 2, while odd_pairs is calculated in a similar manner for odd elements. The function does not consider edge cases where the input list is empty or contains only one type of integer (either all even or all odd).
