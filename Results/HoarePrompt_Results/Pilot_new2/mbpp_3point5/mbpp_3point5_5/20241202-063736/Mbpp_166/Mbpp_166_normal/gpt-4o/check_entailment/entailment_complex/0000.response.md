Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. It correctly counts the number of even and odd elements in the list, then calculates the number of pairs for both even and odd elements separately. Finally, it returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs, which represents the total number of pairs that xor to an even number. The implementation is consistent with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
