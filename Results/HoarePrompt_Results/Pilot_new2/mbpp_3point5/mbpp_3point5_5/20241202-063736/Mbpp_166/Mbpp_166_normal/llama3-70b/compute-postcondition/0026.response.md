According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of `nums` is greater than the value of `i + 1`. The loop will continue to execute until `j` reaches the length of `nums`. Before the loop starts, the `count` is the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number, so it doesn't affect the execution of the loop. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is equal to the new value of `i` plus 1. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than `i + 1`, `count` is the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the new value of `i` plus 1**
