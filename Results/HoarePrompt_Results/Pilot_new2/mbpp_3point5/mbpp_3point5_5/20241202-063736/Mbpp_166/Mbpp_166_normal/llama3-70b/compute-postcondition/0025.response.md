According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `count` is the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number, `i` is less than the length of `nums`, and `j` is equal to `i + 1`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `j` should be equal to the new value of `i` plus 1.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `count` is the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the new value of `i` plus 1**
