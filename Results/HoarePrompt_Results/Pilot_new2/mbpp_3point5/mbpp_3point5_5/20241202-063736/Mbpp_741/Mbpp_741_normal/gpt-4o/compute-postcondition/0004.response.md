According to the code, the loop can execute if the string `s` is not empty. The loop iterates over each character in the string. Before the loop starts, the string `s` is the input string and `first_char` is the first character of the string `s`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `s` must not be an empty string, and `char` is the first character of the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of `s`**
