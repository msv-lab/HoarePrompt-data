Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` correctly follows the problem description. The function checks if the input string is empty or if all the characters in the string are the same. It returns True if either of these conditions are met, and False otherwise. The code iterates through each character in the string and compares it to the first character, returning False immediately if a different character is found. The code also includes test cases that verify the correctness of the function for different inputs. Since the code meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints align with the code logic, the correctness of the program is True.
