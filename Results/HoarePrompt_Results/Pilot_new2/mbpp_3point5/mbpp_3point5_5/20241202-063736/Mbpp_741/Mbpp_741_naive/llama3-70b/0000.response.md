Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately check whether all the characters in the input string are the same. It simply checks if the length of the set of characters in the string is 1, which means there is only one unique character in the string. 
However, this does not guarantee that all characters are the same. For example, the input string "aab" would return True according to the program, even though not all characters are the same.
