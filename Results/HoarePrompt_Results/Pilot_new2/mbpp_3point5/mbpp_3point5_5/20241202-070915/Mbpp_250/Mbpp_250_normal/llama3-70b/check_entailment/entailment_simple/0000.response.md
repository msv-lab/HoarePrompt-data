Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and then uses the `count` method on tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. This directly aligns with the problem description, as the function correctly counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. Therefore, the program is correct.
