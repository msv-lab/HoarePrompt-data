Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function takes in a tuple and an element and correctly counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple using the `count()` method. This logic works correctly for all potential cases, as the `count()` method in Python accurately counts occurrences of an element in a tuple. Hence, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
