Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The provided test cases also cover different scenarios such as when the element is not present in the tuple (returns 0), when the element appears multiple times (returns the correct count), and when the element appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the tuple. All test cases pass, indicating that the program works as expected for all potential cases.
