Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. This program follows the problem description accurately and should work correctly for all cases. There are no edge cases or scenarios provided where this program would not work as expected. Hence, the program is correct.
