Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in the program directly follows the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes in two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them using the `max()` function. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the output hints also align with the code, confirming that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
