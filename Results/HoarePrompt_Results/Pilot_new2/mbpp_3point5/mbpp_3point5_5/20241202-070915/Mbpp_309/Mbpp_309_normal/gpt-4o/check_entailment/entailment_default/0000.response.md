Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greater integer between them using a ternary operator. The code is simple and straightforward, and it exactly follows the problem description. The provided test cases also match the expected behavior of the function. Additionally, the output hints are consistent with the code, confirming that the function correctly returns the greater integer between the two input parameters. Therefore, based on the code, description, and output hints, the correctness of the program is True.
