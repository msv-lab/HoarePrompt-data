Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them using the `max()` function. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to find the maximum of two numbers. The program follows the problem description accurately and will always return the maximum value between the two input integers.
