Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer arguments `a` and `b` and returns the maximum of the two numbers using the `max()` function in Python. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to find the maximum of two numbers. The program will always return the correct maximum value between the two integers `a` and `b`. Hence, the program is correct.
