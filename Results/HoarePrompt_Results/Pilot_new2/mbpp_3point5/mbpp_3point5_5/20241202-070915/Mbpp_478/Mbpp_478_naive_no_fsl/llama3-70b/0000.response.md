Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from the given string, but the function implementation only returns the uppercase characters of the input string. It does not actually remove the lowercase substrings. 

For example, if we have the input string "HeLLo WoRLd", the current implementation would return "HLR" instead of "LL WR". 

Therefore, the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
