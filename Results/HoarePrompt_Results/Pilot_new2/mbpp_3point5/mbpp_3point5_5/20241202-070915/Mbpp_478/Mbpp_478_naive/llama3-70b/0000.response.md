Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the problem description. It only removes lowercase characters from the string, but it does not actually remove the entire lowercase substrings as required. For example, if the input string is "AbcDefGhI", the program will return "ADGI" instead of removing the entire "bc" and "ef" substrings. Hence, the program does not work as expected for all potential cases.
