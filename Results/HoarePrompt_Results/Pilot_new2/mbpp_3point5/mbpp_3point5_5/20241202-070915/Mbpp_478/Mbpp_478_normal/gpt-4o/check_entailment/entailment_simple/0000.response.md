Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string composed only of the uppercase characters from the original string. This aligns with the problem description, which requires removing lowercase substrings from the given string. The program achieves this by using list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string and only keeping the uppercase characters. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
