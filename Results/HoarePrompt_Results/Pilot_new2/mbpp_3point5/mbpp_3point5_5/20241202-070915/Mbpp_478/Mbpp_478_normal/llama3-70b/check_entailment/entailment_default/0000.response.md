Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that consists of only the uppercase letters present in the original string `s`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. The code uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the input string `s` and checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the character is uppercase, it is included in the output string. Since the code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints confirm the functionality, we can conclude that the code is correct.
