Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. The code uses list comprehension to achieve this by iterating over each character in the input string and only including it in the output if it is uppercase. The provided examples also match the expected output based on the problem description. Since the code seems to handle all cases correctly, the correctness is True.
