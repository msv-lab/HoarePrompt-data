Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns a tuple containing the absolute value and phase of the complex number using the `abs` and `cmath.phase` functions, respectively. This aligns with the problem description that specifies the function should convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. The code seems to be correct and handles the conversion of complex numbers to polar coordinates as described. The output hints also agree with the code by stating that the function returns the absolute value and phase of the complex number, confirming that the code is correct. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
