Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that accepts a complex number `num` and returns its polar coordinates (magnitude, phase angle) using the `cmath` module. The function is called with different inputs, and the output is compared against expected values using assert statements. The function seems to be correctly implemented based on the description provided. The code aligns with the problem description, and there are no edge cases identified where the code would not work as expected. The output hints also support the functionality of the code, indicating that the function returns the polar coordinates correctly. Therefore, the code is deemed correct.
