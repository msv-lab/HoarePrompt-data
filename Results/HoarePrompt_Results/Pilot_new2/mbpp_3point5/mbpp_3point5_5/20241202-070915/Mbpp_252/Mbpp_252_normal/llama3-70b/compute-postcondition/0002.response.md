Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a complex number c and returns its absolute value and phase. **

The function seems to correctly return the absolute value and phase of the complex number 'c'. However, there is a missing import statement for the `cmath` module which is necessary for calculating the phase of a complex number. It would be crucial to include an import statement like `import cmath` at the beginning of the code to ensure the correct functionality of the function.
