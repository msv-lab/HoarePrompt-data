Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. The function then returns two lists, the first list containing the first element of each sublist and the second list containing the second element of each sublist, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The list comprehension used in the return statement correctly extracts the first and second elements of each sublist in the input list and constructs the two output lists accordingly. Therefore, the program always follows the problem description and is correct.
