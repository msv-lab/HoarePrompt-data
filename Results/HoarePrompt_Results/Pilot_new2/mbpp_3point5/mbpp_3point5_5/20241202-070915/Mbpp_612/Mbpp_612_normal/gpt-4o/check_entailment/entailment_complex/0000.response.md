Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function described in the problem description. It takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second. The function `func_1` extracts the first elements of each sublist into the list `first_elements` and the second elements into the list `second_elements`, then returns a list containing both `first_elements` and `second_elements`. This implementation satisfies the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
