Example Answer:
The code creates a new list `first_elements` that contains the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The `first_elements` list is now populated with the first elements of each sublist. The `list_of_lists` remains unchanged.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains two elements; first_elements is a list containing the first elements of each sublist in list_of_lists**
