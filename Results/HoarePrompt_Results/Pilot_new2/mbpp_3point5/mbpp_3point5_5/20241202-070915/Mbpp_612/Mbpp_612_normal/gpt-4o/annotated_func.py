#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains two elements.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    first_elements = [sublist[0] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    second_elements = [sublist[1] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
    #The program returns two lists, first_elements which contains the first elements of each sublist in list_of_lists, and second_elements which contains the second elements of each sublist in list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains two elements. It then extracts the first elements of each sublist into the list first_elements and the second elements into the list second_elements. Finally, it returns a list containing both first_elements and second_elements.
