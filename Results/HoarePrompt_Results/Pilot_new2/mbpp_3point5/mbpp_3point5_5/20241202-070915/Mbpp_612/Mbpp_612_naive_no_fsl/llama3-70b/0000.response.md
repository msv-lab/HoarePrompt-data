Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The program achieves this by using list comprehension to extract the elements from the input list of lists. The implementation seems to correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases, as it accurately extracts and groups the elements as required.
