Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes a list of lists as input, extracts the first and second elements from each sublist, and then returns a list of two lists where the first list contains all the first elements and the second list contains all the second elements. The program then uses assert statements to check the correctness of the function by comparing the output for three different test cases. 

For all the provided test cases, the program works correctly as it extracts the first and second elements from each sublist and constructs two lists accordingly. The expected output matches the actual output for all the test cases provided. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
