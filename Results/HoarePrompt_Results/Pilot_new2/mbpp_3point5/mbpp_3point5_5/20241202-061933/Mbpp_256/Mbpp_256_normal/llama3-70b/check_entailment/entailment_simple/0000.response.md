Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- Function `func_1` takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the count of prime numbers less than `n`. It correctly loops through numbers from 2 to `n-1`, checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function, and increments the count if it is prime. The function then returns the count of prime numbers less than `n`.
- Function `is_prime` correctly determines whether a given number `num` is prime. It first checks if `num` is less than 2 and returns False if it is. Then, it iterates through numbers from 2 to the square root of `num` and checks if `num` is divisible by any of those numbers. If it finds a divisor, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True if no divisors are found, indicating that `num` is prime.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
