According to the code, the loop will execute again only if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 12, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n^2`, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then the state of the variables remains the same. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Since `i` is currently 3, it should be incremented to 4. Also, since the loop condition is `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and the loop is currently iterating over `range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`, the value of `n` must be such that the square root of `n` is greater than or equal to 4. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 16, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is 4, `j` is `n^2`, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False**.
