According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `num` is greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, the loop will execute when `i` ranges from 2 to the square root of `num` (exclusive). Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `num` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
