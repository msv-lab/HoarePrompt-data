Functionality: **The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and determines if it is a prime number. It checks if `num` is less than 2 and returns False in that case. Then, it iterates through numbers from 2 to the square root of `num` and returns False if `num` is divisible by any of these numbers. Finally, it returns True if `num` is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). The function accurately determines whether the input `num` is a prime number by checking for divisibility.**
