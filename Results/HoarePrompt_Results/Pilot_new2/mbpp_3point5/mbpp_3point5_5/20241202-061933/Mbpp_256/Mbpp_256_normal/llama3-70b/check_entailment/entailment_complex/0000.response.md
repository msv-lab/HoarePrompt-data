Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The code does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2, which would lead to an incorrect count of prime numbers.
2. Additionally, the function does not consider the scenario where `n` is equal to 2, resulting in a count of prime numbers being 0 when it should be 1.
