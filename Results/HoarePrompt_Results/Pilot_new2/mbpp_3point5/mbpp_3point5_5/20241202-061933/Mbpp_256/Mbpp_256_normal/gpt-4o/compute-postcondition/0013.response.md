Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, and satisfies the condition `is_prime[i]`, `j` is `n^2`, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False**
