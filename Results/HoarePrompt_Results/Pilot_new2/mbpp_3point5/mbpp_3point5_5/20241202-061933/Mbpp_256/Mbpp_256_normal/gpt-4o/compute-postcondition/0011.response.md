According to the code, the loop executes as long as `j` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and satisfies the condition `is_prime[i]`, `j` is 6, and `is_prime[j]` is now False. The next iteration will increment `j` by `i`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated accordingly. Since `i` is 2, the next value of `j` will be 8.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 6, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is 2 and satisfies the condition `is_prime[i]`, `j` is 8, and `is_prime[j]` is now False**
