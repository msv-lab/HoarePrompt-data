The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case 1: If `n` is 0, the program returns 0.

Case 2: If `n` is greater than 0, the program generates a list `is_prime` with boolean values where False represents non-prime numbers and True represents prime numbers from 2 to `n-1`. Then, the program returns the sum of all boolean values in the list `is_prime`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is 0. If `n` is greater than 0, the program calculates the sum of boolean values in the list `is_prime` representing prime numbers from 2 to `n-1`.
