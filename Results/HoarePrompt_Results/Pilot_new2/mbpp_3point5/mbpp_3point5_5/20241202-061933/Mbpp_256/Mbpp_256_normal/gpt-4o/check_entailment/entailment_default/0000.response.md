Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where `n` is equal to 1, as mentioned in the output hints. This can lead to incorrect results because the function will return 0 for `func_1(1)` when it should ideally return 0 since there are no prime numbers less than 1. Thus, the code does not fully follow the problem description for all potential cases.
