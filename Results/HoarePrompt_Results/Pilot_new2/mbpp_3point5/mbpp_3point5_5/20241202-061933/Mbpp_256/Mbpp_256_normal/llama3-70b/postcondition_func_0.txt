The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n`. The function iterates through numbers from 2 to `n` (exclusive) and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function. It then returns the count of prime numbers found within the specified range. The code does not consider the case where `n` is less than 2, which would lead to an incorrect count of prime numbers. Additionally, the function does not handle the scenario where `n` is equal to 2, resulting in a count of prime numbers being 0 when it should be 1.
