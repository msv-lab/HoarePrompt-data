Correctness: **True**

The provided program takes in a non-negative number `n` and correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than `n`. It does this by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark all non-prime numbers as False in a list `is_prime`, and then returns the sum of all True values in the list, which represents the count of prime numbers.

The algorithm correctly handles numbers less than or equal to 2 by returning 0, which is the expected behavior. For all other cases where `n` is greater than 2, the program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
