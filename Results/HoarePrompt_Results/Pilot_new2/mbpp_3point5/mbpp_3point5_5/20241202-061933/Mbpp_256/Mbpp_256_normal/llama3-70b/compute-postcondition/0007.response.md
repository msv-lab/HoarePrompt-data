According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3. `num` is not divisible by 2**
