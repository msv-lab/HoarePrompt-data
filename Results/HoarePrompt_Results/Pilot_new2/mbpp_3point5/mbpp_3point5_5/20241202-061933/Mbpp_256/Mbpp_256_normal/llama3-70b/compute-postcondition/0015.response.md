The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it returns False in multiple cases:
- Case 1: The program returns False
- Case 2: The program returns False if num is divisible by i, where num is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and i is 2
- Case 3: The program returns False
- Case 4: The function returns False if the non-negative integer 'num' is not divisible by 2 and 3
- Case 5: The function returns True if the non-negative integer 'num' is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of 'num' (inclusive).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to determine if a non-negative integer 'num' is a prime number by checking for divisibility with certain conditions.
