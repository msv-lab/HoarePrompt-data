Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. 
The function first initializes a list `is_prime` where all numbers are considered prime by default. Then, it iterates through the numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of `n` and marks the multiples of each number as non-prime. This is done using a sieve of Eratosthenes approach to efficiently mark non-prime numbers. Finally, it returns the sum of `is_prime` list which will give the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

The provided assertions `assert func_1(5) == 2`, `assert func_1(10) == 4`, and `assert func_1(100) == 25` indicate that for the given inputs, the function is returning the correct count of prime numbers. Since the program is able to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement and passes the provided test cases, the correctness is deemed as True.
