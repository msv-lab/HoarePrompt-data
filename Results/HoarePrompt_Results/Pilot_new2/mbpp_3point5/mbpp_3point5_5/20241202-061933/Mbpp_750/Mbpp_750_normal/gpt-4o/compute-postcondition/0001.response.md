The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `lst` and `tpl`. `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple. The function returns the concatenation of list `lst` and the elements of tuple `tpl` as a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that contains the elements of both `lst` and `tpl`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that contains the elements of both `lst` and `tpl`.**
