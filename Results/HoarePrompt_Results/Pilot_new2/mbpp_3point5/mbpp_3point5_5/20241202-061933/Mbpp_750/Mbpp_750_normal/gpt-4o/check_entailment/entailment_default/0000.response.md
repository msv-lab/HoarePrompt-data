Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and then concatenates the elements of the tuple to the list using the `+` operator. This results in a new list that contains all the elements of the original list followed by the elements of the tuple, which is then returned. The function behaves as described in the problem description for all potential cases. The code handles the addition of the tuple to the list correctly and returns the expected output. The function is simple and straightforward, and there are no edge cases or potential scenarios mentioned in the description where the code might not work correctly.
