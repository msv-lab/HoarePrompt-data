#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tpl is a tuple.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns the concatenation of list lst and the elements of tuple tpl as a list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then it concatenates the `lst` and the elements of `tpl` to form a new list, which is then returned. The function does not handle cases where `lst` or `tpl` is None, empty, or contains elements other than lists or tuples, which might lead to unexpected behavior.
