Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then it concatenates the `lst` and the elements of `tpl` to form a new list, which is then returned. The function does not handle cases where `lst` or `tpl` is None, empty, or contains elements other than lists or tuples, which might lead to unexpected behavior. **
