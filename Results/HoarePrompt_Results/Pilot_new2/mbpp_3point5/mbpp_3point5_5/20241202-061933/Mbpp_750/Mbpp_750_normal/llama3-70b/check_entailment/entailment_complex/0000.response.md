Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input. The function then concatenates the elements of the tuple `tup` after converting them into a list, and returns the result of this concatenation with the list `lst`.

This implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description, as it indeed adds the elements of the tuple to the list as required. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the specified requirements.
