Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in the program correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, then concatenates `lst` with the elements of `tup` after converting them into a list. This logic is effectively implemented in the code, and there are no edge cases or scenarios where the code does not behave as expected. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, supporting the conclusion that the code is correct for all potential cases.
