The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `lst` and `tup`. `lst` is a list and `tup` is a tuple. After executing the function body, the function returns the concatenation of the list `lst` and the elements of the tuple `tup` converted into a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return the concatenation of `lst` with the elements of `tup` converted into a list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, returns the concatenation of `lst` with the elements of `tup` converted into a list.**
