Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the input list `lst` followed by the elements of the input tuple `tpl`. The function achieves this by converting the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)` and then concatenating it with the input list `lst` using the `+` operator. The assert statements provided in the problem description also verify that the function works as expected by adding the tuple elements to the list correctly. Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
