Correctness: **True**

The provided function takes a list and a tuple as input and adds the elements of the tuple to the list. It does this by converting the tuple to a list using the `list()` function and then concatenates it with the original list using the `+` operator. This approach correctly implements the problem description and works for all potential cases.
