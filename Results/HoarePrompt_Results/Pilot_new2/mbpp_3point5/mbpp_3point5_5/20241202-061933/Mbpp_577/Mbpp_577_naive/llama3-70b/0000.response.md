Correctness: **False**

The given program does not accurately find the last digit in the factorial of a given number as per the problem description. The program only returns specific values for certain inputs without actually calculating the factorial and finding the last digit. For example, when the input is 5, the expected output should be 0, but the program does not handle this case and returns 0 without calculating the factorial. Hence, the program is incorrect as it does not work for all potential cases.
