Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the last digit in the factorial of a given number. It calculates the factorial of the given number and then returns the last digit of that factorial by taking the modulus with 10. This approach is valid and ensures that the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all non-negative integers between 1 and 5 inclusive.
