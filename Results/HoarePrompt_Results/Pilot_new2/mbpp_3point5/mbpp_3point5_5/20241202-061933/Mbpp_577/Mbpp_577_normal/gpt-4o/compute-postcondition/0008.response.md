According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `i` in the range from 1 to `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, and the factorial is the product of all numbers from 1 up to `n+1` multiplied by `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`, so the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.
State: **n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, factorial is the product of all numbers from 1 up to n+2 multiplied by n+1**
