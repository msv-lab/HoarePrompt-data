The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If `n` is any non-negative integer, the function returns 0.

Case_2: If `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, the function calculates the product of all numbers from 1 up to `n`, multiplies it by `(n+1)`, and returns the last digit of this result. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 for any non-negative input value or calculate the product of numbers from 1 up to `n`, multiply it by `(n+1)`, and return the last digit of this product if `n` is between 1 and 5 inclusive.
