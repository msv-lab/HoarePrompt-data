According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is less than 5. It will iterate from 1 to n (inclusive). Before the loop starts, the factorial is 1, which indicates that the loop hasn't started yet. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be between 1 and 4 inclusive, and `factorial` should be 1. Also, `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **n is a non-negative integer, n is between 1 and 4 inclusive, factorial is 1, i is 1**
