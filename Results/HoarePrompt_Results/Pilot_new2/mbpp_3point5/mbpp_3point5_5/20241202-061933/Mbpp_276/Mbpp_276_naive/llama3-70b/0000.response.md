Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and calculates the volume using the formula V = Ï€ * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The implementation correctly follows the problem description and there are no edge cases or inputs where it would fail to provide the correct volume of the cylinder. Hence, the program is correct.
