Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the provided formula `volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The function then uses `math.isclose` assertion to check if the calculated volume is close to the expected value with a relative tolerance of 0.001. This ensures that the function is returning the correct volume for different combinations of radius and height. All the provided test cases pass, indicating that the program works as expected for all inputs.
