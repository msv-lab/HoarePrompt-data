#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.**
def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the product of π, the square of the radius, and the height
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative numbers, radius and height, and returns the product of π, the square of the radius, and the height. It calculates the volume of a cylinder given the radius and height. However, the code is missing the import statement for the math module (import math), which is essential for the calculation to work.
