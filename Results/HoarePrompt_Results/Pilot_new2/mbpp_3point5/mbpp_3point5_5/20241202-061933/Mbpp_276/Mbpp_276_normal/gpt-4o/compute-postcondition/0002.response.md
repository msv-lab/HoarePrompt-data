The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, the program returns the volume calculated as `math.pi * radius squared * height`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the volume calculated using the formula `math.pi * radius squared * height`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume calculated as `math.pi * radius squared * height`.**
