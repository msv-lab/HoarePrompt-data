Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two non-negative integers `cost_price` and `selling_price`. The function then checks if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price` and returns True if they are equal, and False otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss, which in this case means checking if the cost price is equal to the selling price. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
