Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` simply checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price. This condition will only be satisfied when there is neither profit nor loss, which aligns with the problem description. For every potential case, if the cost price is equal to the selling price, then the function will return True, indicating no profit and no loss. There are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
