Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program defines a function that recursively flattens a nested list structure. The function correctly handles nested lists by extending the flat_list with the result of calling itself recursively on each nested list. The provided test cases cover a variety of nested lists and the function correctly flattens them as expected. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
