Correctness: **True**

I believe the provided program is correct as it recursively flattens a given nested list structure by checking each element in the list. If the element is a list, it calls the function recursively on that element until all nested lists are flattened. Once all elements are processed, the function returns the flattened list. The logic seems to be handling all potential cases and correctly flattening the nested list structure.
