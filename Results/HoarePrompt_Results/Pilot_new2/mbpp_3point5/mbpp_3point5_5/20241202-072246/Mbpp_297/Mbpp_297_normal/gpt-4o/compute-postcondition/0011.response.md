According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the list has at least 3 items, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists that must have at least 2 items. If the second item is a list, flat_list is a list containing the elements returned by func_1(second_item) and item is the second item in the nested_list. If the second item is not a list, flat_list contains the second item from nested_list with func_1 applied. Additionally, if the second item is not a list, item is added to flat_list after applying func_1.

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the nested_list must have at least 3 items. If the second item in the nested_list is a list, flat_list should contain the elements returned by func_1(second_item) and item should be the third item in the nested_list. If the second item is not a list, flat_list should contain the second item from nested_list with func_1 applied and item should be the third item in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists that must have at least 3 items. If the second item is a list, flat_list is a list containing the elements returned by func_1(second_item) and item is the third item in the nested_list. If the second item is not a list, flat_list contains the third item from nested_list with func_1 applied. Additionally, if the second item is not a list, the third item is added to flat_list after applying func_1.**
