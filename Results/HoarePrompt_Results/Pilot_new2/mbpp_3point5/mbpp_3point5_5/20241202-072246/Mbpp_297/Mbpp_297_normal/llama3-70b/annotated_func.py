        if isinstance(element, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(element))
        else:
            flat_list.append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: nested_list is a nested list structure. flat_list contains all elements of nested_list flattened, with any nested lists being replaced by their elements.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns a flat list containing all elements of the nested list structure nested_list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a nested list structure `nested_list` and recursively flattens the structure into a single list by replacing any nested lists with their elements. The function returns the flat list containing all elements of the original nested list structure.
