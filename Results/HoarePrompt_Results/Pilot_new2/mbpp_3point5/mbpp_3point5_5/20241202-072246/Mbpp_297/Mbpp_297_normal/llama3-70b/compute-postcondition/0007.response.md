According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. 

At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 1 element. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, nested_list must have at least 2 elements.

If the first element of nested_list is a list, flat_list is a list containing the elements returned by func_1(element), and element is a list. In this case, element should be the second element in the nested_list for the loop to execute again.

If the first element of nested_list is not a list, flat_list is a list containing only the first element of nested_list, and element is the first element in nested_list. In this case, element should be the second element in the nested_list for the loop to execute again.

State: **nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 2 elements, flat_list is updated based on the type of the first element in nested_list, element is the second element in nested_list**
