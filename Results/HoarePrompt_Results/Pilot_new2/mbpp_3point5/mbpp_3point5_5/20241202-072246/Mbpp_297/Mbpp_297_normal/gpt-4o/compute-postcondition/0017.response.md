The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists. The function returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements flattened with `func_1` applied to each nested list in the `nested_list` structure. If any item is not a list, `flat_list` contains all items flattened, including those returned from `func_1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to flatten the nested list structure and apply `func_1` to each nested list within it, returning a flat list with all elements flattened.
