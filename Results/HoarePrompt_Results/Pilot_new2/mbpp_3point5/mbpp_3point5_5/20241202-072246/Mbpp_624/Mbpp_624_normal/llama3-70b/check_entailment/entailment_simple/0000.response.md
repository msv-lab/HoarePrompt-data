Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description by using the `upper()` method to convert the given string to uppercase. This implementation will work for all potential cases as the `upper()` method in Python converts all lowercase characters in the string to uppercase. Therefore, the program always follows the problem description.
