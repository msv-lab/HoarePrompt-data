Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns its uppercase version using the `upper()` method in Python. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to convert a given string to uppercase. Since the program always returns the uppercase version of the input string, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
