Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of that string using the `upper()` method in Python. The code meets the problem description as it correctly converts the given string to uppercase for all test cases provided. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the function `func_1` indeed accepts a string parameter `s` and returns its uppercase version. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
