The function func_1 accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns the total number of elements in the tuple. It iterates over the elements of the tuple until it encounters a tuple element, at which point it stops counting and returns the total count of elements encountered so far. However, there is a missing condition where the function should handle cases where there are no tuple elements in the tuple `tup` as it currently does not account for this scenario.
