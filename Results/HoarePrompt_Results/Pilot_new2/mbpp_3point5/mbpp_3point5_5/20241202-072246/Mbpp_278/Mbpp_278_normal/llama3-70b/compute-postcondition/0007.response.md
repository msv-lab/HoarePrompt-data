According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `tup` and `elem`. If `elem` is still present in the `tup`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, and `elem` is an instance of tuple and present in `tup`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `elem` must still be present in `tup`.
State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `elem` is an instance of tuple and still present in `tup`**
