According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the count is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `tup` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in the tuple.  
State: **`tup` has at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `tup`**
