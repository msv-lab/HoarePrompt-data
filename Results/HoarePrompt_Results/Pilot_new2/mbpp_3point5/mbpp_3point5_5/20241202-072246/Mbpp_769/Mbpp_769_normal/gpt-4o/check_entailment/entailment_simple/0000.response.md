Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input, converts them into sets, finds the symmetric difference between the two sets, converts the resulting set back into a list, sorts the list based on the indexes in the combined input lists, and returns the sorted list. This exactly matches the problem description of getting the difference between two lists and sorting the result.

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description.
