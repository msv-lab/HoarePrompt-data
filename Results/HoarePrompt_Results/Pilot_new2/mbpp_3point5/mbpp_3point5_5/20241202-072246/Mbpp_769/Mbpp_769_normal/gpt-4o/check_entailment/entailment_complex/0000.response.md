Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function to get the difference between two lists. It calculates the symmetric difference of the two input lists, creates a new list with these elements, and sorts them based on their indexes in the combined list of list1 and list2. The program follows the problem description and always produces the expected output.
