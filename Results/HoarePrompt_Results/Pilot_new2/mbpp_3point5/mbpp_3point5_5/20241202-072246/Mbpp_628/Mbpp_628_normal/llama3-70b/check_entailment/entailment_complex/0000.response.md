Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where all spaces are replaced with '%20'. The `replace` method in Python is used to achieve this functionality. The program strictly follows the problem description and always replaces spaces with '%20' in the input string. Therefore, the program is correct.
