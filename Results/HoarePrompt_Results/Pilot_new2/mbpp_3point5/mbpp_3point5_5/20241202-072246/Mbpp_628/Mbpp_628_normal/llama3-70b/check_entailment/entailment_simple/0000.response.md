Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function func_1 that takes a string as input and returns the same string with all spaces replaced by '%20'. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The program uses the replace() method which replaces all occurrences of a specified value in a string with another value. Since it replaces all spaces with '%20', it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
