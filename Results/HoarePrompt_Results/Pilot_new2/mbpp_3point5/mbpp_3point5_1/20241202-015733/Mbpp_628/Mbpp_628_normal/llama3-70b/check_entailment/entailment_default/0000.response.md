Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code directly replaces all spaces in the input string `s` with '%20' without any additional conditions or processing. The problem description also states that the function should replace all spaces in the given string with '%20', which the code accomplishes. Since the code exactly follows the problem description for all potential cases, we can conclude that the code is correct.
