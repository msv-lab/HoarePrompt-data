Correctness: **True**

The program defined in the annotated code correctly replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20'. This is achieved using the `replace` method in Python, which replaces all occurrences of a specified value with another value in a string.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
