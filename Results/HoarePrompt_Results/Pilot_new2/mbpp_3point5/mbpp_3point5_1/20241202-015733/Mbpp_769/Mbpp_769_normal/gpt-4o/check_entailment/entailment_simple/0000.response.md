Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input, calculates the symmetric difference between the two lists using sets, then sorts the elements based on their index in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. This aligns with the problem description of getting the difference between two lists and returning the sorted elements.

Therefore, the program is correct as it fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
