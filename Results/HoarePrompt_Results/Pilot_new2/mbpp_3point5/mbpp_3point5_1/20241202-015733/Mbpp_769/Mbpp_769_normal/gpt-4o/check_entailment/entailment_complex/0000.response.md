Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two lists, finds the symmetric difference between them, converts it to a list, sorts the unique elements based on their index in the concatenated form of the input lists, and returns the sorted list. This aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem description.
