Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the difference between two lists, but it seems to be incorrectly implemented. The code correctly finds the symmetric difference between the two input lists by using `symmetric_difference()`, converts it to a list, and sorts the unique elements based on their index in the concatenated form of the input lists. 

However, there is an issue with the sorting logic. The code sorts the elements based on their index in the concatenated form of the input lists, which may not be the correct approach. The description does not mention sorting based on the index in the concatenated list; it simply asks for finding the difference between the two lists. This sorting logic might not handle all cases correctly, especially when dealing with lists with repeated elements or different ordering.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fully adhere to the problem description.
