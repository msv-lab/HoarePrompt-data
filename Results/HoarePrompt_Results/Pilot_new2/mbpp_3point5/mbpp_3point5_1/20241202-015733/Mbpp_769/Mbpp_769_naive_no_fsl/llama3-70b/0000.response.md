Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly uses sets to get the symmetric difference between the two lists, which is the difference between the two lists. The use of set operations ensures that duplicate elements are handled correctly, and sorting the result ensures that the output is in the correct order. The program should work correctly for all cases.
