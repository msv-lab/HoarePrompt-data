Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that iterates over the elements of the input tuple and counts the number of elements that occur before a tuple element is encountered. It correctly stops counting once a tuple element is found using the `isinstance` function. The provided test cases all return the expected output, indicating that the program works as described in the problem statement. Since all the test cases pass and the logic of the function aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
