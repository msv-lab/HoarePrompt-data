Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it only considers the first occurrence of a tuple in the input tuple and returns its index. However, the problem description asks for the number of elements that occur before the tuple element. The program does not count the total number of elements before the tuple element, which makes it incorrect.

For example, if we input `func_1((1, 2, (3, 4), 5, 6, (7, 8)))`, the expected output should be 3, as there are three elements (1, 2, (3, 4)) before the first tuple element (3, 4). However, the program will return 2 as it only considers the first tuple it encounters.
