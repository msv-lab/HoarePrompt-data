Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the elements of the input tuple `tup` and returns the count of elements before the first occurrence of a tuple. If a tuple is encountered during the iteration, the loop breaks, and the count is returned. The examples provided in the problem description also match the output produced by the function. Additionally, there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
