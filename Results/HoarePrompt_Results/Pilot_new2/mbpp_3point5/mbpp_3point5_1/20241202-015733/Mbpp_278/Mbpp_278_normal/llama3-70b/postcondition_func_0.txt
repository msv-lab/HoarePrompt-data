The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. It iterates through the elements of the tuple and checks if an element is a tuple. If it finds a tuple element, it returns the index of that element in the tuple. If no tuple element is found, it returns the length of the tuple. Therefore, the function provides the index of the first tuple element in the tuple if present, otherwise returns the length of the tuple.
