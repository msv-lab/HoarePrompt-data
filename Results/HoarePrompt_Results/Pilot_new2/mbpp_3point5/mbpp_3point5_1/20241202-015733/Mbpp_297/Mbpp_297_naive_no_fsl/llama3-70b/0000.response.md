Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively calling the function `func_1` on each element of the list. The base case is when an element is not a list, in which case it is added to the `flat_list`. This logic ensures that the program correctly flattens all levels of nesting in the list. Additionally, the program handles empty lists and non-list elements appropriately. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
