Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain nested lists. It recursively flattens the nested_list by iterating through each element and appending non-list elements to a flat_list. The function returns the flattened version of nested_list after processing all elements in the list with a loop.**
