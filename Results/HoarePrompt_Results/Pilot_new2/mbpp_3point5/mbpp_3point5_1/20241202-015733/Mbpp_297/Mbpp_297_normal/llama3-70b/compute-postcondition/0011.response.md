According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `nested_list`. If there are more elements left to iterate through, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 elements. To execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the list.
If the next element in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` will be updated by extending the result of `func_1(next_element)`. If the next element is not a list, it will be appended to `flat_list`.
State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements. The program needs to verify the next element in `nested_list` to determine how `flat_list` will be updated.**
