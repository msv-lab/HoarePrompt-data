Postcondition: ***nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 element. If item is a list, flat_list will contain the elements returned by func_1(item) and item is the first element in the nested_list. If item is not a list, flat_list will contain the first element from nested_list and item is still the first element in the nested_list.***
