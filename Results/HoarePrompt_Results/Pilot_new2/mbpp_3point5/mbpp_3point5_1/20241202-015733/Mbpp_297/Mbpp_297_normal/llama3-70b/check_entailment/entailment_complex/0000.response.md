Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function to flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively iterates through each element in the nested list and appends non-list elements to a flat list, effectively flattening the structure. The function returns the flattened version of the nested list as required by the problem description. The comments within the code also provide a clear explanation of what the function does, further confirming its correctness.
