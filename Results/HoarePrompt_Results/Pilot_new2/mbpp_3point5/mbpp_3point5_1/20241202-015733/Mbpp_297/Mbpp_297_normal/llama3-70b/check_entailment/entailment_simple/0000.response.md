Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and flattens it by recursively processing each element. If an element is a list, it recursively calls itself on that element until it reaches a non-list element, which is then appended to the `flat_list`. This process continues until all elements in the nested list have been processed and the final `flat_list` is returned.

The program follows the problem description of flattening a nested list structure and ensures that the output is a single flattened list containing all elements from the nested list. The recursive nature of the function allows it to handle multiple levels of nesting and correctly flatten the input list.
