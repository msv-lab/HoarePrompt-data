Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements. If an element in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is updated by extending the result of `func_1(element)` for each element in `nested_list`. If none of the elements in `nested_list` are lists, `flat_list` is updated with the appended elements.***
