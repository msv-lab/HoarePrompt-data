According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the beginning, flat_list is empty. So for the loop to execute, the nested_list must have at least 1 element and the item is the first element in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 1 element, flat_list is an empty list, item is the first element in the nested_list**
