According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list has at least 1 element. If the first element of nested_list is a list, flat_list will contain the elements returned by func_1(element). Otherwise, if the first element of nested_list is not a list, flat_list will only contain the first element of nested_list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, nested_list must have at least 2 elements and flat_list should be updated accordingly based on the condition.
State: **nested_list is a list that must have at least 2 elements, flat_list is updated based on the condition**
