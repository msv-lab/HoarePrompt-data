Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the function to flatten a given nested list structure. The function `func_1` accepts a nested list structure as a parameter and recursively flattens it into a single list by extracting all elements from nested lists. The code iterates through each item in the input list, and if the item is a list, it recursively calls the `func_1` function on that sublist. If the item is not a list, it appends the item to the flat_list. The final flat_list returned contains all elements in the order they appeared in the original nested list. 

After reviewing the code and the problem description, as well as testing with multiple examples provided, it can be concluded that the code works correctly for all potential cases. Hence, the correctness is **True**.
