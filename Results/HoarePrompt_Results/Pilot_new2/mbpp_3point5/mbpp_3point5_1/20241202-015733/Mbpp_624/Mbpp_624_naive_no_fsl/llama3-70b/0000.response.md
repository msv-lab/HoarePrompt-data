Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program defines a function that takes a string as input and converts it to uppercase using the `upper()` method. This implementation correctly follows the problem description and should work for all potential cases. Since the code is simply using the built-in functionality of Python to convert a string to uppercase, there are no edge cases or scenarios where this implementation would fail.
