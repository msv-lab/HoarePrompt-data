Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function called `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of that string using the `upper()` method. This exactly matches the problem description, which asks for a function that converts a given string to uppercase. The program consistently follows the problem description for all potential cases.
