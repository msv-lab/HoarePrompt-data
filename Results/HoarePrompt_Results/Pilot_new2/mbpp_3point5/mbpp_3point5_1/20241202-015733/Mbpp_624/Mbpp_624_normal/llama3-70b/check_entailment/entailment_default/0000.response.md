Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple one-liner function that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method in Python. The problem description is to convert a given string to uppercase, and the code exactly does that for all potential cases. There are no edge cases to consider in this scenario, and the output hints align with the code in a straightforward manner. Since the code follows the problem description for all cases and the output hints confirm the correctness, the correctness of the code is True.
