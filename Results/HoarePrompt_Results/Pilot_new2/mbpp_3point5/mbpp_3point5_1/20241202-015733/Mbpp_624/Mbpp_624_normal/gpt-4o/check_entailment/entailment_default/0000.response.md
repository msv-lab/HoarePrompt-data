Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. The code is simple, concise, and directly addresses the problem description, which is to convert a given string to uppercase. The function `func_1` performs this task correctly for all potential cases, such as 'person', 'final', and 'Valid', as shown in the provided assert statements. The code aligns perfectly with the problem description, and the output hints also confirm that the code is working as expected by correctly converting the input strings to uppercase. Hence, the correctness of the code is **True**.
