Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and converts it to uppercase using the `upper()` method. This implementation correctly converts all characters in the input string to uppercase, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the `upper()` method is a built-in string method in Python that ensures the conversion is performed correctly and consistently for all inputs. Since there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
