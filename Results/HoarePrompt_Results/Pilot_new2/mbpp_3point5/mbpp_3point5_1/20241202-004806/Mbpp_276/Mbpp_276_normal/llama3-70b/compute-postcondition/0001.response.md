The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative numbers. The function calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the calculated volume of a cylinder using the given formula. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative numbers (radius and height) and returns the calculated volume of a cylinder using the formula math.pi * radius**.
