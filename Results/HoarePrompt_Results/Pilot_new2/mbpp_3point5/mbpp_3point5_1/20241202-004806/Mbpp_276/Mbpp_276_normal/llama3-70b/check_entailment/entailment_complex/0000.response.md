Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and correctly computes the volume using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which requires the function to calculate the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
