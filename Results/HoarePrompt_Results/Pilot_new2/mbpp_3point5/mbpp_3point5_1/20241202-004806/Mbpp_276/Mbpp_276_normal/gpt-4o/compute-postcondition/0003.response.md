Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative numbers, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula math.pi * radius^2 * height, and returns the calculated volume. **

Potential Edge Case: The function does not handle cases where either radius or height is negative, which could lead to incorrect volume calculations.
