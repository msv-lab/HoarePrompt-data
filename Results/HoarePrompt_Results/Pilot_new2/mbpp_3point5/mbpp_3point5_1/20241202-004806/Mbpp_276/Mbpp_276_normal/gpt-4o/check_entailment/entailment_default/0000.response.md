Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius^2 * height` as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in two non-negative numbers, representing the radius and height of the cylinder, and returns the calculated volume. The code also includes assertions to verify the correctness of the calculated volumes for given inputs, ensuring that the code works correctly for those specific cases. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description or output hints that are not handled by the code. Thus, based on the code and problem description, the correctness of the program is evaluated as **True**.
