Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct as it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and calculates the volume using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, which is the correct formula for calculating the volume of a cylinder. The code only accepts non-negative numbers for radius and height as mentioned in the problem description. Additionally, there are no edge cases mentioned in the description that the code might not be handling, and the formula used is accurate for calculating the volume of a cylinder. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the program seems to be correct.
