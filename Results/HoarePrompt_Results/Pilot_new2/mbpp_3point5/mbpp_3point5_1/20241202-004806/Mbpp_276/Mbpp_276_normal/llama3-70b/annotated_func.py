#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.**
def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the result of calculating the volume of a cylinder using the formula math.pi * radius
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative numbers (radius and height) and calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula math.pi * radius
