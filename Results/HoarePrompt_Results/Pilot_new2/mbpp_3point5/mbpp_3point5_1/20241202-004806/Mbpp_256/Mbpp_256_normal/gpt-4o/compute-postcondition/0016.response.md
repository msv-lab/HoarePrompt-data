According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `j`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range of `[i*i, n)` with a step size of `i`. 
Before the loop starts, `i` is 3, so `j` must start from `i*i` which is 9. The loop should execute as long as `j` is less than `n` with a step size of `i` which is 3. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 3, `j` starts at 9 and goes up to `n` with step size 3**
