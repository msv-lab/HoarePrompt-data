According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 2 and a prime number, `j` is 6, and `is_prime[j]` is now False. Since the loop updates `j` by adding `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should still be less than `n`. Therefore, the next value of `j` should be calculated as `j + i`, and `is_prime[j+i]` should be False.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 2 and a prime number, `j` is 8, `is_prime[j+i]` is now False**
