You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. n is larger than 2.
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of n elements where each element is True if the corresponding index is a prime number, and False otherwise.
    return sum(is_prime)
    #The program returns the sum of the elements in the list `is_prime`, where each element is True if the corresponding index is a prime number, and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. For `n` greater than 2, the function generates a list `is_prime` where each element is True if the index is a prime number, and False otherwise. It then returns the sum of the elements in the `is_prime` list. However, the code does not handle the case when `n` is 1 or 2, where the function should return 0 according to the comments, but `is_prime` is not being correctly calculated.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
