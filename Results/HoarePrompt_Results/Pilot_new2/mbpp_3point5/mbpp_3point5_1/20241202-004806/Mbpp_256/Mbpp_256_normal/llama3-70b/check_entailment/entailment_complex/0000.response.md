Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Both the `func_1` and `is_prime` functions follow the problem description accurately. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n` (inclusive), and the `is_prime` function accurately determines if a given number is prime. The annotations provided align with the logic implemented in the code, and there are no cases identified where the program deviates from the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
