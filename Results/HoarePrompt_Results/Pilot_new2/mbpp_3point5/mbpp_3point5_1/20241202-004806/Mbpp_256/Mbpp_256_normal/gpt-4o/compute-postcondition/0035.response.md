The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If `n` is 0, the program returns 0.

Case_2: If `n` is greater than 0, the program returns the sum of the elements in the list `is_prime`, where each element is True if the corresponding index is a prime number, and False otherwise.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is 0. If `n` is greater than 0, it calculates the sum of elements in the `is_prime` list based on whether the corresponding index is a prime number or not.
