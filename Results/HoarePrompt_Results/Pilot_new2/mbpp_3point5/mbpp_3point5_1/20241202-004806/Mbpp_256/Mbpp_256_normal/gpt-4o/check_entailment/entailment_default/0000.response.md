Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input `n` is 1 or 2. According to the problem description, in these cases, the function should return 0. However, the code does not correctly calculate the `is_prime` list for these specific inputs, leading to the incorrect output. Hence, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
