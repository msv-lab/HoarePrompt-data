Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `is_prime` correctly identifies prime numbers by checking if the input number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number.
- The main function `func_1` correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n` by iterating through numbers from 2 to `n-1` and checking if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function.
- The program handles the case when `n` is less than 2 by returning 0, as there are no prime numbers less than 2.
- The program correctly counts the prime numbers less than `n` for all non-negative inputs.
