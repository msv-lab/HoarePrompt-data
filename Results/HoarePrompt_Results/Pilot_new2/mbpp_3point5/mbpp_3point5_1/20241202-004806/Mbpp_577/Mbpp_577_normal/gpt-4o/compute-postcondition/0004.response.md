According to the code, the loop can execute if n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, n is a non-negative integer and less than 5 which means it can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, since the loop starts from 1, n must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the factorial variable is initialized to 1 before the loop starts. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `factorial` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `factorial` is 1**
