Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not accurately find the last digit in the factorial of a given number as described in the problem description. The code only considers specific cases such as when `n` is less than 2, when `n` is 2 or 3, and when `n` is 4. For all other values of `n`, it simply returns 0, which does not match the requirement of finding the last digit in the factorial of `n`. The output hints do not align with the code logic, as they describe a different functionality than what the code is actually doing. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
