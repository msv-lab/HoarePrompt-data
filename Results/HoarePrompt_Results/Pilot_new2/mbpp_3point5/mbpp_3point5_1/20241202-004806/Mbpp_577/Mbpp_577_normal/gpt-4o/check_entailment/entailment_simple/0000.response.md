Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the last digit in the factorial of a given number. It first calculates the factorial of the input number `n` and then returns the last digit of that factorial by taking the modulus 10. The program checks if the input number is greater than or equal to 5, in which case it directly returns 0. For input numbers less than 5, it calculates the factorial and returns the last digit.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
