#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0.**
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return n
        #The program returns the value of n, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If n is less than 2, then n is less than 2.
    else :
        if (n == 2 or n == 3) :
            return n
            #The program returns the value of n, which is either 2 or 3
        else :
            if (n == 4) :
                return 4
                #The program returns 4
            else :
                return 0
                #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than or equal to 0 and returns different values based on the value of `n` as follows:
- If `n` is less than 2, the function returns the value of `n`.
- If `n` is either 2 or 3, the function returns the value of `n`.
- If `n` is 4, the function returns 4.
- For any other value of `n`, the function returns 0.
Therefore, the functionality of the function accurately reflects the code logic and covers all potential cases.
