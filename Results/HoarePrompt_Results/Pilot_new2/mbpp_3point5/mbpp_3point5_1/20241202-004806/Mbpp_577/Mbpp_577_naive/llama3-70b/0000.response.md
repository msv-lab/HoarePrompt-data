Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number as described in the problem statement. The program simply returns 0 for all inputs greater than 4, which is incorrect. 

For example, if we take n = 5, the program should return 0 as the last digit of 5! is 0. However, the program returns 0 for all values of n greater than 4, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
