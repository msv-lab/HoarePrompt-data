Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number for all potential cases. The program only returns 0 when the input number is greater than 4, which is not the correct behavior. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120, so the last digit should be 0, but the program would return 0 instead.
