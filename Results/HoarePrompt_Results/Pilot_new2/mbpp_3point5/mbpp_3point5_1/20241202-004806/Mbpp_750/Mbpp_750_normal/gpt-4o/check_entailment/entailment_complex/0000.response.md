Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input. The function then concatenates the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tpl` converted into a list using the `list()` function. This exactly matches the problem description, which asks for a function to add the given tuple to the given list. 

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
