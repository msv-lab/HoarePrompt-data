#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tup is a tuple.**
def func_1(lst, tup):
    return lst + list(tup)
    #The program returns the concatenation of list 'lst' and the elements of tuple 'tup' converted into a list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list lst and a tuple tup, then returns the result of concatenating lst with the elements of tup after converting them into a list. The code accurately performs this concatenation operation without any missing functionality or edge cases.
