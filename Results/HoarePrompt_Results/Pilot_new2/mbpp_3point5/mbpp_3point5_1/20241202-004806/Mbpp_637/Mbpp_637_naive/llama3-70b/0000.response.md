Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price, which implies that there is no profit and no loss. This logic is correct as per the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios where this logic would fail to determine whether there is no profit and no loss.
