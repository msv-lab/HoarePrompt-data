Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two non-negative integers `cost_price` and `selling_price`. It then checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price` and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.

This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. In this case, having the `cost_price` equal to the `selling_price` indicates that there is no profit or loss. Therefore, the program follows the problem description accurately.
