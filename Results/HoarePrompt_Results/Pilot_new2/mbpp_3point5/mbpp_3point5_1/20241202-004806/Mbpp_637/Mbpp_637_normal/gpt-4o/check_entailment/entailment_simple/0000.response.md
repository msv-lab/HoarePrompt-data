Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns `True` if the cost price is equal to the selling price, and `False` otherwise. This directly aligns with the problem description which asks for a function to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss, which essentially means checking if the cost price is equal to the selling price. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
