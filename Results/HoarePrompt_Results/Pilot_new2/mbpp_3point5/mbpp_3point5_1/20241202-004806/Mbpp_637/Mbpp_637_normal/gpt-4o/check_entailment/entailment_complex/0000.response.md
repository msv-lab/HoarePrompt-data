Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two non-negative integers `cost_price` and `selling_price` representing the cost price and selling price of an item. The function simply checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price` and returns True if they are equal, otherwise it returns False. This exactly matches the problem description which asks for a function to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. Since having equal cost price and selling price implies no profit and no loss, the program is correct.
