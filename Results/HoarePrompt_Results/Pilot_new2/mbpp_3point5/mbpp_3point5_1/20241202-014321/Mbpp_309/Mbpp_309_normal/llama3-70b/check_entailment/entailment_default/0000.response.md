Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple implementation of finding the maximum of two numbers using the `max()` function in Python. The description states that the function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them. The code exactly follows this description and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the code. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the function does what it is supposed to do, which is to return the maximum of the two input numbers. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
