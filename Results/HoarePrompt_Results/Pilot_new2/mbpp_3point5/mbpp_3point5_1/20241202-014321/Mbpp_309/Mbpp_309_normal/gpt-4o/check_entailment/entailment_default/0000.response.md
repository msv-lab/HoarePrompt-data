Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function called `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greater integer between them using a ternary operator. The code is simple and straightforward, and it follows the problem description accurately. It correctly returns the maximum of two numbers, and it also accounts for the scenario where `a` is equal to `b` by returning `a`. Additionally, the provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for different input scenarios, further supporting the correctness of the code. Hence, based on the code and the problem description, the program is correct.
