Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the greater integer between them. This matches the problem description of finding the maximum of two numbers. The program uses a conditional expression to check if `a` is greater than `b`, and returns `a` if true, otherwise returns `b`. Additionally, if `a` is equal to `b`, the function will still return `a`, which is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
