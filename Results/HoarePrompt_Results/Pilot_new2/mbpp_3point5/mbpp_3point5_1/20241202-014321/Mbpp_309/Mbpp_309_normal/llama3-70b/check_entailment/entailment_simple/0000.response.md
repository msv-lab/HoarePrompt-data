Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function called func_1 that takes in two integers, a and b, and returns the maximum value between them using the max() function. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to find the maximum of two numbers. The program will always return the correct maximum value between the two input integers.
