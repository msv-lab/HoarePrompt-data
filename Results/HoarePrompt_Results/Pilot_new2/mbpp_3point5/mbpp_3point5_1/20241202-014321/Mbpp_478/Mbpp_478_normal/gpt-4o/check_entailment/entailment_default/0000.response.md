Correctness: **False**

The program does not completely follow the problem description. The function is only removing lowercase characters from the input string, but it is not removing the entire substring containing the lowercase characters. For example, the input 'PYTHon' should return 'PYTH', but the program returns 'PYTHon' because it only removes the lowercase 'on' characters individually. The code is not handling the case of removing entire lowercase substrings as required by the problem description.
