Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Since the program filters out any non-uppercase characters and returns the result, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
