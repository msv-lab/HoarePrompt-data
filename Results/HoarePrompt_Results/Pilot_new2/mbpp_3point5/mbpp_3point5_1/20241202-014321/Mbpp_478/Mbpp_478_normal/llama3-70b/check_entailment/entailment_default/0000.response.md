Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in the function `func_1` correctly filters out all lowercase characters from the input string `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters. The problem description specifies that the function should remove lowercase substrings from the given string, and the code does exactly that by using a generator expression with the `isupper()` method to filter out lowercase characters. Since the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is determined to be true.
