Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with only the uppercase characters from the original string. This aligns with the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. The program iterates through each character in the input string and only includes it in the output string if it is an uppercase character. This logic correctly implements the desired functionality for all potential cases.
