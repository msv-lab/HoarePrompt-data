Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function that takes a complex number as input and returns its absolute value (magnitude) and phase (angle) in polar coordinates. The program uses the `abs` function to calculate the absolute value of the complex number and the `cmath.phase` function from the `cmath` library to calculate the phase of the complex number.

Since the program correctly implements the conversion of complex numbers to polar coordinates as specified in the problem description, it is considered correct.
