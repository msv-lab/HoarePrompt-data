#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a complex number.
def func_1(c):
    return abs(c), cmath.phase(c)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the complex number c and the phase of the complex number c using the cmath library
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a complex number c and returns the absolute value and phase of c using the cmath library. It correctly returns the absolute value of c but is missing the import statement for the cmath library, which may result in an error when trying to calculate the phase of c.
