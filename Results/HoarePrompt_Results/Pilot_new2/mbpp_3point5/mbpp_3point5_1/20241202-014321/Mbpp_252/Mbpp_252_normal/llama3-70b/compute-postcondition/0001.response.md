The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `c`, where `c` is a complex number. The function calculates and returns two values: the absolute value of the complex number `c` and the phase of the complex number `c`. The function uses the cmath library to perform these calculations. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a complex number `c` and return its absolute value and phase using the cmath library. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a complex number c and returns the absolute value and phase of c using the cmath library.**
