Correctness: **False**

The code provided correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates by returning the absolute value and phase of the complex number. However, the output hints mention that the code is missing the import statement for the cmath library, which is required for calculating the phase of the complex number. This inconsistency between the code and the output hints makes the correctness of the code questionable. Thus, the code is considered incorrect due to the missing import statement for the cmath library.
