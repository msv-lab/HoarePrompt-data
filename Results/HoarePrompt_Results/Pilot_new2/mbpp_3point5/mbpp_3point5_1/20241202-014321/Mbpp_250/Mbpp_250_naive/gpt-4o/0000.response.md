Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python function `func_1` correctly takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The assertions provided in the program also test with different cases and the output matches the expected counts. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
