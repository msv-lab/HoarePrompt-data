Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program takes in a tuple and an element, and then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. This is the most straightforward and efficient way to achieve the desired functionality. It covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the `count` method is a built-in method in Python and is well-tested, so we can be confident in its correctness.
