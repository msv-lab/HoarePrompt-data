Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the count() method to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The provided test cases cover scenarios where the element is not present in the tuple (return 0), where the element occurs multiple times in the tuple (return the correct count), and where the element occurs only once in the tuple (return 1). The program works as expected for all these cases, so the correctness is True.
