Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`. The function then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element `elem` within the tuple `tup`, which exactly matches the problem description. The program always returns the correct count of occurrences of the element within the tuple, hence meeting the requirements of the problem description.
