#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and element is any data type.**
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the number of occurrences of the 'element' in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, then it returns the number of occurrences of the `element` in the `tup`. The function does not handle cases where `element` is not in the tuple, and it assumes `element` is present in `tup`.
