Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The program then has 3 test cases to verify its correctness:

1. `assert func_1([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]) == [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]` - This test case checks if the function correctly extracts the first and second elements of each sublist in the input list of lists.

2. `assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]) == [[1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]]` - This test case verifies the correct extraction of elements from integer sublists.

3. `assert func_1([[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]], [[5], [6]], [[7], [8]]]) == [[[1], [3], [5], [7]], [[2], [4], [6], [8]]]` - This test case tests the program's ability to handle sublists containing single-element lists.

Since the program passes all the test cases and correctly follows the problem description for each potential case provided, the correctness is **True**.
