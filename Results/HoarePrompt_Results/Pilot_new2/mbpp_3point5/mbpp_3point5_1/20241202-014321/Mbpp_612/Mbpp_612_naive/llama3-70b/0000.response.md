Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the problem description. It returns a list of two lists, where each inner list contains all the elements (first or second) from the original list of lists, instead of grouping the first elements in one list and the second elements in another list. This is a deviation from the specified requirement. 

For example, consider the input list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]. The program should return [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]] according to the problem description. However, the actual output of the program is [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]], which is not aligned with the expected output.
