The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the program returns a list of two lists. The first list contains all the first elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains all the second elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists, extract the first and second elements from each sublist, and return them as two separate lists.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists with two elements each. It returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains all the first elements of the sublists and the second list contains all the second elements of the sublists.**
