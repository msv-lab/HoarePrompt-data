Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, and then it returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The program uses list comprehension to extract the first and second elements of each sublist in the input list_of_lists. The annotations in the code also confirm that the program is returning two lists with the desired elements. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
