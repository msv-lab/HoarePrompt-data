The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names and values are tuples of two floats representing student height and weight. `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a new dictionary containing student names along with their corresponding height and weight tuples, only including students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter out students from the input dictionary based on the minimum height and weight constraints provided, and return a new dictionary with the filtered students' information.
Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student information along with minimum height and weight values, and returns a filtered dictionary containing only students who meet the height and weight criteria.**
