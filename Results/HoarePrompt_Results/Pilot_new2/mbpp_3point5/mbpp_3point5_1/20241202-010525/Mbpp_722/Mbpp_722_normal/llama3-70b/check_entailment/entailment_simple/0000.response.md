Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function called func_1 that takes in a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It then filters the students based on the given minimum height and weight criteria and returns a dictionary containing only the students who meet both criteria.

The program correctly filters the students based on both height and weight, as stated in the problem description. It iterates through the student_data dictionary, checks if the height and weight of each student are greater than or equal to the minimum height and weight respectively, and only includes those students in the final dictionary.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
