Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that checks if all the characters in the input string `s` are the same as the first character `first_char`. It returns True if all characters match the first character, otherwise it returns False.

The code handles the case where the input string is empty by checking `if not s` and returning True, which means an empty string is considered to have all characters the same (since there are no characters to compare with).

The code is also tested against multiple cases, including a case with all characters being the same ('aaa'), a case with different characters ('python'), and a mix of characters ('data'). The assertions pass for these cases, verifying that the function behaves as expected for these scenarios.

Based on the code and the provided problem description, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all the characters in the input string are the same or not.
