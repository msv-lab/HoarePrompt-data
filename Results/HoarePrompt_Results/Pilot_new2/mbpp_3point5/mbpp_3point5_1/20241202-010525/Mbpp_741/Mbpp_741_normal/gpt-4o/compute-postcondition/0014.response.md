Output State: **The loop will return False if any character in the string `s` is different from the first character `first_char`. If all characters are the same as `first_char`, the loop will continue until the end of the string `s` is reached without changing the state of the variables. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `s` remains the same non-empty string, `first_char` is still the first character of `s`, and `char` is equal to `first_char` for all characters in `s`.**
