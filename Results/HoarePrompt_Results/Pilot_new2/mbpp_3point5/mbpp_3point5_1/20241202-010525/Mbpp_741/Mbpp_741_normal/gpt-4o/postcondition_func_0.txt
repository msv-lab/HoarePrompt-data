The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. It checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same as the first character `first_char`. If all characters match the first character, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. The function does not cover the case where the input string `s` is empty, which should ideally return False.
