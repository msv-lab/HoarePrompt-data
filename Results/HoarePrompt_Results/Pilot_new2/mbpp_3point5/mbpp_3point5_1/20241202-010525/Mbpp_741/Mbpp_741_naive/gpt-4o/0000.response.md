Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether all the characters in the input string are the same or not. It correctly returns `True` if all characters are the same, and `False` otherwise. The program has been tested with multiple examples, including 'python', 'aaa', and 'data', and it produces the correct output for all of them. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where it does not work as expected.
