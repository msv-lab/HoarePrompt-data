According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `j` is greater than `i + 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of `nums` + 1**
