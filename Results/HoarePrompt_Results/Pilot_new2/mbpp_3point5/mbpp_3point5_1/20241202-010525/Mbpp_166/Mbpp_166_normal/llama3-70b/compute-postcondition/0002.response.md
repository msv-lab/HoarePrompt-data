According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `nums` has at least 2 elements since `i + 1` needs to be less than the length of `nums`. The loop also requires `j` to be initialized as `i + 1` to indicate the starting index. So, the states that need to be adjusted are: `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is `i + 1`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `i + 1`**
