The function func_1 accepts a parameter nums, which is a list of integers. It calculates the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in nums such that the XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number. The function iterates through all possible pairs of elements in nums and increments count whenever the XOR operation results in an even number. Finally, it returns the total count of such pairs. The function assumes nums has at least 2 elements.
