Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. It does so by first calculating the count of even and odd numbers in the list and then calculating the number of pairs by using the formula (count * (count - 1) / 2) where count represents the number of even or odd numbers in the list. This approach ensures that all possible pairs are considered and counted correctly. Hence, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
