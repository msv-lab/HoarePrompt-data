Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `lst`, calculates the count of even and odd numbers in the list, then computes the sum of pairs of even and odd numbers. The function returns the total sum of these pairs. However, there is a potential issue with this code as it only considers pairs of even and odd numbers, excluding pairs of either even or odd numbers. This missing functionality should be noted for complete accuracy.**
