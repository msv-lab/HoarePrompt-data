#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.**
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
    #The program returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs, where even_pairs is equal to the count of even numbers in `lst` multiplied by count of even numbers in `lst` minus 1 divided by 2, and odd_pairs is equal to the count of odd numbers in `lst` multiplied by count of odd numbers in `lst` minus 1 divided by 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `lst`, calculates the count of even and odd numbers in the list, then computes the sum of pairs of even and odd numbers. The function returns the total sum of these pairs. However, there is a potential issue with this code as it only considers pairs of even and odd numbers, excluding pairs of either even or odd numbers. This missing functionality should be noted for complete accuracy.
