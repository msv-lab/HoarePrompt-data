According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `count` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `i + 2`, and the XOR operation between the elements at index `i` and `j` in `nums` results in an even number. Since `j` is `i + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than the length of `nums`, so `j` should be increased by 1. 
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `i + 3`, and the XOR operation between the elements at index `i` and `j` in `nums` results in an even number.**
