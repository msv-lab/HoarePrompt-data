Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation results in an even number, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 2 and less than the length of `nums`. The XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number.***
