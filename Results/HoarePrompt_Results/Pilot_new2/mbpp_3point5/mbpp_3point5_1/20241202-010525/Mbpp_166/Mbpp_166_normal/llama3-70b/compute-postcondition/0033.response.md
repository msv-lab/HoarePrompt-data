According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation results in an even number, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 2 and less than the length of `nums`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. So, the next iteration would require `j` to be greater than the previous value. 
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation results in an even number, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than the previous value and less than the length of `nums`**
