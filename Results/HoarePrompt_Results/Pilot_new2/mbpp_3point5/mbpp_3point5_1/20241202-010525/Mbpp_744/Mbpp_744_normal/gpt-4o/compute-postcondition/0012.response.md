The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. The program has multiple return points based on different cases. In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, the program returns `True`. In Case 4, the program returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return `True` in Cases 1, 2, and 3, and `False` in Case 4.
