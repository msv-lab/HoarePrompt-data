Correctness: **True**

The code provided in the program matches the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and returns True if there is any element in the tuple that is None, otherwise it returns False. The code uses the `any` function along with a generator expression to check for the presence of None in the tuple. If the tuple is empty, the function will return False as there are no elements to check for None. 

After reviewing the code and comparing it with the problem description, it can be concluded that the code works correctly for all potential cases and edge cases mentioned in the problem description.
