Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function called `func_1` which takes a tuple as input. It then uses the `any` function to check if there is any element in the tuple that is `None`. If there is any element that is `None`, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

This implementation perfectly matches the problem description, as it accurately checks if the given tuple has any `None` value or not.
