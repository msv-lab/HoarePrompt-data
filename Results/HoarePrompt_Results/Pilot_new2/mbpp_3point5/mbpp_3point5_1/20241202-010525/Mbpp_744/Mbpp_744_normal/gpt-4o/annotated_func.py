#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    for item in tup:
        if item is None:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a tuple where all items are non-None. If any item in `tup` is None, the function returns True. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of `tup`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. It iterates through the items in the tuple and if it encounters a `None` value, it returns True. If all items in the tuple are non-None, it returns False. The functionality described in the annotations matches the actual code.
