Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. It returns `True` if all elements are in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns `False`. This logic covers all potential cases and ensures that the program meets the problem description.
