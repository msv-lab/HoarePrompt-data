Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements. The element at index i+1 is less than or equal to the element at index i+2 and i must be less than the length of lst - 2. If lst[i] > lst[i + 1], the function returns False. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the list.***
