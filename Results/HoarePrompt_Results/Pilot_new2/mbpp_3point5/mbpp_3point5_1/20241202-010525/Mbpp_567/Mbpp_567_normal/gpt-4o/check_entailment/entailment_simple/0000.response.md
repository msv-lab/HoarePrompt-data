Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If at any point an element is greater than the next one, it returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that the list is sorted. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, making the program correct.
