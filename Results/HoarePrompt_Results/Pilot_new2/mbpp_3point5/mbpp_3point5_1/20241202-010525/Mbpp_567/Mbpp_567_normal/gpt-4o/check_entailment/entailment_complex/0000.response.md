Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as input and iterates through the list to check if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If at any point an element is found to be greater than the next element, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. This exactly matches the problem description, which requires the function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The program consistently follows the problem description for all potential cases.
