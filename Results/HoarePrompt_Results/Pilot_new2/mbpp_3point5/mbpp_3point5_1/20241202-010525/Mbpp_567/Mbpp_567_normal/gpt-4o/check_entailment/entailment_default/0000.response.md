Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as input and iterates through the list. If it encounters an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns False. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding any such element, it returns True. This logic correctly aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should check whether the specified list is sorted or not. 

The code covers all potential cases as it correctly identifies both sorted and unsorted lists based on the comparison of elements. There are no edge cases identified where the code fails to follow the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code's logic, confirming the correctness of the program. Thus, we can conclude that the code is correct for this problem.
