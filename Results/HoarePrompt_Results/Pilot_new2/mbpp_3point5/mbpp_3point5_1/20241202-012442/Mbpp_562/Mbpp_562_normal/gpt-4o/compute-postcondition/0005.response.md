According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is equal to the length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `list_of_lists` must have at least 2 sublists and the `max_length` should be equal to the length of the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is equal to the length of the second sublist in `list_of_lists`**
