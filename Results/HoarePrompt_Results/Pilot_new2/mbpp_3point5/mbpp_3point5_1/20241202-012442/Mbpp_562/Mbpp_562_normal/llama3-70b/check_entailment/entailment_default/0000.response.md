Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input. It then uses a generator expression to calculate the length of each sublist and returns the maximum length among all the sublists. This aligns with the problem description which asks for finding the length of the longest sublist. Since there are no constraints mentioned in the problem description and the code correctly implements the logic as described, the code is correct.
