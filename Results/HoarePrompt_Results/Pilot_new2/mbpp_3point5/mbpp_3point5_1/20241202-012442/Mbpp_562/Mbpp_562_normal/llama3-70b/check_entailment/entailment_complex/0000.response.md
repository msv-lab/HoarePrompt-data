Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist within that list of lists. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to find the length of the longest sublist.

The program achieves this by using a generator expression to iterate over each sublist in the input list 'lists' and then finding the length of each sublist. Finally, it returns the maximum length found.

Therefore, the program is correct and fulfills the requirements of the given problem description.
