Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and iterates over each sublist to determine the length of the longest sublist. It then returns the length of this longest sublist. This matches the problem description, which asks for a function to find the length of the longest sublist in the input list.

The program will always work correctly because it correctly updates the `max_length` variable by comparing the length of each sublist in the input list. It ensures that `max_length` stores the length of the longest sublist in the list, which is then returned at the end. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
