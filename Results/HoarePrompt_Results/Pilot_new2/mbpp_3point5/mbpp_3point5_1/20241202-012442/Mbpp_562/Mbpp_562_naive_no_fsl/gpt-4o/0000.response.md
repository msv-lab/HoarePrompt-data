Correctness: True

Explanation: The function iterates through each sublist in the list_of_lists and compares the length of each sublist to the current max_length. If the length of the sublist is greater than the current max_length, it updates max_length. The function then returns the max_length, which represents the length of the longest sublist. The provided test cases cover different scenarios with varying lengths of sublists and the function correctly identifies the length of the longest sublist in each case. Hence, the program is correct.
