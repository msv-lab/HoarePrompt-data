Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function that takes a list of sublists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. The program accomplishes this by using a generator expression within the max() function to find the length of each sublist in the input list and then selecting the maximum length. This logic correctly aligns with the problem description, and the program is able to find the length of the longest sublist in the input list. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
