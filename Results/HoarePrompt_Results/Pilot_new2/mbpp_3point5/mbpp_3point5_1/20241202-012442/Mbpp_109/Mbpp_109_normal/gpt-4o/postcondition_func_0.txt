The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a string containing only '0's and '1's, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. The function rotates the `binary_str` by moving the last character to the beginning for the specified number of `num_rotations`. After each rotation, it calculates the integer value of the updated `binary_str` in base 2 and counts the number of times the integer value is odd. The function returns the final count of odd integer values.
