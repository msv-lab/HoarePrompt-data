The function func_1 accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It repeats the binary string `s` to have a length greater than `n`, then calculates the sum of the counts of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `n` and returns this sum modulo 2. It correctly handles cases where the binary string `s` is shorter than `n` by repeating it accordingly.
