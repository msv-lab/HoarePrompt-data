    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `binary_str` is a string containing only '0's and '1's with the last character moved to the beginning, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the number of times the `integer_value` is odd after each iteration, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2.
    return count
    #The program returns the count of times the integer value of `binary_str` is odd after each iteration
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a string containing only '0's and '1's, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. The function rotates the `binary_str` by moving the last character to the beginning for the specified number of `num_rotations`. After each rotation, it calculates the integer value of the updated `binary_str` in base 2 and counts the number of times the integer value is odd. The function returns the final count of odd integer values.
