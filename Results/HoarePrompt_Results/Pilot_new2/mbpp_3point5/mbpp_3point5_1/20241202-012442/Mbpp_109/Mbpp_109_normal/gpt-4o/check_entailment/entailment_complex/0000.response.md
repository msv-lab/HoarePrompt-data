Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `binary_str` and the number of rotations `num_rotations` as input. It then rotates the binary string by moving the last character to the beginning for the specified number of rotations. After each rotation, it calculates the integer value of the updated `binary_str` in base 2 and counts the number of times the integer value is odd. Finally, it returns the count of odd integer values.

The program ensures that the binary string is rotated correctly and correctly counts the number of odd values after each rotation. The annotations explain the state of the program before and after the for loop, making it clear what each variable represents at each stage. The function follows the problem description provided and returns the expected result.
