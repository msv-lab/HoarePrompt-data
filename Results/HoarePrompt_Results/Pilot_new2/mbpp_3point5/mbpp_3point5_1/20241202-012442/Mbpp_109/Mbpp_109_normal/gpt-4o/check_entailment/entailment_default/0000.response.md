Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` takes a binary string (`binary_str`) and the number of rotations (`num_rotations`) as inputs.
- It then rotates the binary string by moving the last character to the beginning for the specified number of rotations.
- After each rotation, it calculates the integer value of the updated binary string in base 2 and counts the number of times the integer value is odd.
- Finally, the function returns the final count of odd integer values.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case provided:
1. It correctly rotates the binary string.
2. It correctly calculates the integer value of the rotated binary string.
3. It correctly counts the number of odd integer values.
4. It returns the correct count of odd integer values based on the rotation.

Therefore, the code is correct as it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
