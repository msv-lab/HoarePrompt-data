Output State: **`s` is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times, `count` is the previous value of `count` plus the number of '1's in the substring `temp` of `s` starting from index `i+1` and ending at index `i + len(s) + 1` modulo 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `temp` is the substring of `s` starting from index `i+1` and ending at index `i + len(s) + 1`**
