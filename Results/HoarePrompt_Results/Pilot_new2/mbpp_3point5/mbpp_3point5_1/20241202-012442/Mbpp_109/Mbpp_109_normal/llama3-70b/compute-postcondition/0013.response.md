The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. The binary string `s` is a string containing only '0' and '1', while the non-negative integer `n` represents the length of the substrings to be considered. The function calculates the sum of the counts of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `n`, and returns this sum modulo 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the sum of the counts of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `n` modulo 2.
