Correctness: **False**

The given program does not completely follow the problem description. The issue lies in the line that concatenates the parts of the string before and after the first and last occurrences of the given character. The program should remove both the first and last occurrences of the character, but the concatenation includes the character at the first occurrence. This results in only removing the first occurrence and not the last occurrence as intended.

Example where the program does not work correctly:
Input: s = "banana", c = "a"
Expected Output: "bnana"
Actual Output: "bnna"
