Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The function should remove the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. However, the code has an issue in the line `s[first_occ + 1:last_occ]`, as it should actually be `s[first_occ + 1:last_occ - 1]` to exclude both the first and last occurrences of the character. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the character only appears once in the string, as it only checks if both occurrences exist before removing the characters in between. Thus, the code is incorrect.
