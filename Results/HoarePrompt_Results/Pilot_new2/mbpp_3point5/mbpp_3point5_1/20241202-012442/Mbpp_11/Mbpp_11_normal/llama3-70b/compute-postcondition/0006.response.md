The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, a string `s` and a character `c`. The parameter `s` is a string and `c` is a character. In Case_1, the program returns the string `s` with the characters between the first and last occurrences of character `c` removed. In Case_2, the program simply returns the string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, and based on the presence of character `c`, it either returns the original string `s` or removes the characters between the first and last occurrences of character `c`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`. It returns the string `s` with characters between the first and last occurrences of character `c` removed in Case_1, or the original string `s` in Case_2.**
