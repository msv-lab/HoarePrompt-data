Example Answer:
`first_occ` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of character `c` in string `s` using the `find` method. The value of `s` is a string and the value of `c` is a character. If `c` is found in `s`, `first_occ` will be the index of its first occurrence, otherwise, it will be -1. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`**
