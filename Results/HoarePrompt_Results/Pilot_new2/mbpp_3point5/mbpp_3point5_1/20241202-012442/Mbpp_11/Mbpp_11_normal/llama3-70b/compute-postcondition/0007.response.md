Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`. It returns the string `s` with the characters between the first and last occurrences of character `c` removed if both occurrences exist. Otherwise, it returns the original string `s`. **

Note: The annotations state that the function removes characters between the first and last occurrences of character `c`, but there is no handling mentioned in the annotations for cases where either the first or last occurrence of `c` does not exist. To cover potential edge cases, the functionality should also mention that if either the first or last occurrence of `c` is not found, the function will return the original string `s`.
