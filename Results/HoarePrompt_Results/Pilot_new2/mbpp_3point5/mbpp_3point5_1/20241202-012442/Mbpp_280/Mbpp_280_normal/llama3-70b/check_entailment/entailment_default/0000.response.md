Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` which takes in an array `arr` and an element `elem`. It then iterates over the array using `enumerate` to check if any element matches `elem`. If a match is found, the function returns a tuple containing True and the index `i` of the first occurrence of `elem`. If no match is found, it returns a tuple containing False and -1. This logic perfectly aligns with the problem description provided. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the output hints also confirm that the code performs as expected.
