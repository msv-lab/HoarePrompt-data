According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `arr` and the variable `i`. If the list `arr` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list and not equal to `elem`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `i` should be 2, and `x` should be the third element in the list and not equal to `elem`.
State: **`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in the list and not equal to `elem**`.
