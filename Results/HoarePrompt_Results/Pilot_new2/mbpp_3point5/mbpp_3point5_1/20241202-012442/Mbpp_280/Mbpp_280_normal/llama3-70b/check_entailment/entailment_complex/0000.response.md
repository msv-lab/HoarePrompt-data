Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `arr` and an element `elem`, then iterates over the list to find if any element matches `elem`. If a match is found, it returns True along with the index of the first occurrence of `elem`. If no match is found, it returns False and -1. This behavior perfectly aligns with the problem description, which requires the function to return a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element. The program covers all potential cases where the element can be found at different indexes in the list, making it correct.
