Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in an array `arr` and an `element`. It iterates through the array to find the `element`. If the `element` is found, it returns True along with the index of the element. If the `element` is not found, it returns False and index -1. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, where the function is required to return a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if not found). The program handles both cases as specified in the problem description, making it correct.
