According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `arr` list is not empty. The loop will iterate through each element in the list. Before the loop starts, the `arr` list must have at least 1 element to execute the loop. At the beginning of the loop, `i` will be the index of the first element in the list, and `x` will be the first element itself.
State: **`arr` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0 (index of the first element), `x` is the first element in the list**
