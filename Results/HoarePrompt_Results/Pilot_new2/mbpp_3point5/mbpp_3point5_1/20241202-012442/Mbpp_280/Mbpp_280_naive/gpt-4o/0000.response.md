Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the input array using enumerate and checks if the value is equal to the target element. If it finds a match, it returns a tuple containing True and the index of the element. If no match is found, it returns False and -1. The provided test cases cover different scenarios such as finding the element at the beginning, middle, or end of the array, ensuring that the function works correctly in all cases.
