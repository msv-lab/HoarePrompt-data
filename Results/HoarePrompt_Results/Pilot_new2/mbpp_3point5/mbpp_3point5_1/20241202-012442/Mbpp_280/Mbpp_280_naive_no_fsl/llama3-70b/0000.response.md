Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program iterates through the array using `enumerate` and checks if the current element `x` is equal to the target element `elem`. If a match is found, it returns a tuple `(True, i)` where `i` is the index of the element in the array. If no match is found, it returns `(False, -1)`. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making the program correct.
