Correctness: True

Explanation: The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to track both the index and value of each element. If the value matches the element being searched for, it returns a tuple with True and the index. If the element is not found after iterating through the entire array, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The provided test cases cover various scenarios such as finding the element at the beginning, middle, and end of the array, as well as when the element is not present in the array. The function correctly handles all these cases and returns the expected output.
