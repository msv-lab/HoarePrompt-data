Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes two lists as input and divides the elements of the first list by the elements of the second list element-wise. The program then returns a new list with the result of the division. The provided test cases cover various scenarios such as dividing integers, floating-point numbers, and handling different list lengths. In all the test cases, the program produces the expected output, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description.
