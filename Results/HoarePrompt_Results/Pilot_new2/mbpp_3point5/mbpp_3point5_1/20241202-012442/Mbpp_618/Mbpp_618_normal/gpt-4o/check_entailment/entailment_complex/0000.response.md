Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as input. It then creates a new list by dividing the elements of `list1` by the corresponding elements of `list2`, using list comprehension and the `zip` function.

The program is correct as it exactly follows the problem description by dividing two lists element-wise and returning a new list with the results. The annotations also clarify that both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers with the same length, which meets the requirements of the problem description. The program does not explicitly handle division by zero, but this is mentioned in the annotation.
