Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, extracts the digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, and then converts them to form the maximum number x that Masha can make. The program accounts for the fact that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa. All possible cases are covered in the logic provided, and the output is as expected based on the problem description.
