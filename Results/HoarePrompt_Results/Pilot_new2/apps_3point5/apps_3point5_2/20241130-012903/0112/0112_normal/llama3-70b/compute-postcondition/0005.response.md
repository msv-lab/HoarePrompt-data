According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If there are more lists in the `cubes` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a 2D list containing n lists of integers, and `digits` is a set containing the individual digits of all the integers in the `cubes` list. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least n+1 lists in the `cubes` list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a 2D list containing at least n+1 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing the individual digits of all the integers in the `cubes` list**
