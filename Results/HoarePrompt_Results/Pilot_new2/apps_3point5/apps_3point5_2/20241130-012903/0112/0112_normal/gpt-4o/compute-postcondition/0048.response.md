According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num` is an integer greater than 0
- `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`
- `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False)
- `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`
- `found` is False
- `i` is 0
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
