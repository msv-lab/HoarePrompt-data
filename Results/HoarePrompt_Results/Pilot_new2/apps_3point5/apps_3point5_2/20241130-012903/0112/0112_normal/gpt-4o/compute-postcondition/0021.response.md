Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the last digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True if at least one cube was found for the corresponding digit in `digits`, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `digits` and checked for each cube face in `cube_faces`. If `found` is False after the loop execution, then no cube was found for any digit in `digits`.***
