According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If there are more lists in the cubes list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a 2D list containing at least n+1 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing the individual digits of all the integers in the `cubes` list after updating with additional digits from the `cube` list. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must contain at least n+2 lists.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a 2D list containing at least n+2 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing the individual digits of all the integers in the `cubes` list after updating with additional digits from the `cube` list**
