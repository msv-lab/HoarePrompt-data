According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`, and the conditions related to `used_cubes` and `digit`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are:
- `num` is an integer greater than 0, 
- `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num` with at least 1 element, 
- `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where all elements are set to False except for the element at index i which is set to True, 
- `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, 
- `found` is set to True, and 
- `used_cubes[i]` is True.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `used_cubes[i]` needs to be False
- `digit` needs to be in `cube_faces[i]`

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num` with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where all elements are set to False except for the element at index i which is set to True, `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is set to True, and `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
