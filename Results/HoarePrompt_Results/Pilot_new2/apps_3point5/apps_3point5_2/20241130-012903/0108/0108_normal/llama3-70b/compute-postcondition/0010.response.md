According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` has the character `char` replaced with the next character in `alphabet` and the next character in `alphabet` is present in `s` added to it. For the loop to execute one more time, the character after the next character in `alphabet` should also be present in `s`. 
State: **`res` has the character `char` replaced with the next character in `alphabet` and the next character in `alphabet` is present in `s` added to it, the character after the next character in `alphabet` is also present in `s`**
