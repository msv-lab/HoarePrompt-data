According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` now contains the character that comes after `char_next`, and `res` is a string consisting of all characters from `alphabet` up to `char_next` in order with an additional character `char` replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet, and `res` is appended with the new character that comes after `char`. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `char` is in `s`.
State: **`s` now contains the character that comes after `char_next`, `res` is a string consisting of all characters from `alphabet` up to `char_next` in order with an additional character `char` replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet, and `res` is appended with the new character that comes after `char`, and `char` is in `s`**
