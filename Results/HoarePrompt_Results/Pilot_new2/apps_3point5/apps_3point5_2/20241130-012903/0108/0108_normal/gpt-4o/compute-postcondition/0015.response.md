Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of target, `i` must be less than the length of `s` + 3, and `j` must be less than `target_len`. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.***
