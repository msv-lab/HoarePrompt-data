According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `alphabet`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` does not contain the character `char`, `res` is a string consisting of all characters from `alphabet` up to `char` in order. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next character `char` must not be in `s` and `res` should include the next character in `alphabet`.
State: **`s` does not contain the character `char_next`, `res` is a string consisting of all characters from `alphabet` up to `char_next` in order**
