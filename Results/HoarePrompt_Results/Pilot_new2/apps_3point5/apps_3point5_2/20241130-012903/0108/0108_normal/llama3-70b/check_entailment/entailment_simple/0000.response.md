Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It then iterates through each character of the English alphabet and replaces each occurrence of that character in `s` with the next character in alphabetical order. This process is repeated until all characters in the English alphabet have been found in `s`. If at the end, `res` contains all characters of the English alphabet in order, it prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints -1.

This program follows the problem description accurately. It ensures that the final result contains all characters of the English alphabet in order by replacing characters from `s` with the next character in order. It correctly handles the case when it is impossible to form the English alphabet as a subsequence and prints -1 in that case.
