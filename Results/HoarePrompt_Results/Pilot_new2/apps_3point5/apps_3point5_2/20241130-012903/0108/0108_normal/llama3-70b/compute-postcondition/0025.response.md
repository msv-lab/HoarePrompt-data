According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `alphabet` and `char_next`. If the character `char_next` is not present in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` does not contain the character `char_next`, and `res` is a string consisting of all characters from `alphabet` up to `char_next` in order with all characters in `s` replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must still not contain the character `char_next`, and `res` should include the next character in the alphabet after `char_next`.
State: **`s` does not contain the character `char_next`, `res` is a string consisting of all characters from `alphabet` up to the next character after `char_next` in order with all characters in `s` replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet**
