Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input string and iterates through the alphabet while replacing characters in the input string to form the alphabet sequence. If the resulting sequence has a length of 26, it means that the alphabet sequence is a subsequence of the original string, and it will be printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. The program correctly follows the problem description by replacing characters with the next alphabetical character and checking if the resulting sequence contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The logic is sound and covers all possible cases.
