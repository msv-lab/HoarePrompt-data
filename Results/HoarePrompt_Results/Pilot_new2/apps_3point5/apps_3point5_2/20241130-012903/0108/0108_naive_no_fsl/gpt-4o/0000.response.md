Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string and iterates through it to check if the characters form the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' as a subsequence. If it does, it prints the target string, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program is accurate and covers all potential cases as per the problem description. The program will output the correct result for all valid inputs.
