Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. 
1. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0 (c == 0), then the program checks if the first element is Vasya's favorite number. If they are equal, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This covers the case where c is 0.
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is not 0, the program checks if the difference between Vasya's favorite number and the first element is divisible by c and whether the division result is non-negative. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This covers the other cases where c is not 0.

Since the program logic correctly handles all possible scenarios based on the problem description, the correctness is True and the code is considered correct.
