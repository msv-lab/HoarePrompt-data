The function takes three integers a, b, and c as input. It compares b and a, if they are equal, it prints 'YES'. If b and a are not equal, it checks if c is 0, in which case it prints 'NO'. If c is not 0, it verifies if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
