Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It checks if the difference between Vasya's favorite number b and the first element of the sequence a is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements c. If this condition is met and the result is non-negative, it prints "YES", indicating that b appears in the sequence. Otherwise, it prints "NO". This logic is consistent with the problem description for all potential cases.
