The function `func_2` accepts parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the program calculates the total sum of all numbers in the range from `l` to `r` where each number satisfies `func_1(num, k)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the total sum of all numbers in the range from l to r that satisfy func_1(num, k). 
Functionality: **The program returns the total sum of all numbers in the range from l to r where each number satisfies func_1(num, k).**
