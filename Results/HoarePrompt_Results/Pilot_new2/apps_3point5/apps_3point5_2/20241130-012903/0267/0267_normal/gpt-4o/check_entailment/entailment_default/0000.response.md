Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The program does not handle the case when the input numbers l and r are negative.
2. The function func_1 only checks if the count of unique digits in the string representation of a number is less than or equal to k. It does not consider the case where the number itself should be made up of at most k different digits.
3. The function func_2 calculates the total sum of all numbers from l to r, but it does not take into account the condition of having at most k different digits in each number.
4. The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. For example, for the input (10, 50, 2), the expected output is 1230, which is not achieved by the given program.
