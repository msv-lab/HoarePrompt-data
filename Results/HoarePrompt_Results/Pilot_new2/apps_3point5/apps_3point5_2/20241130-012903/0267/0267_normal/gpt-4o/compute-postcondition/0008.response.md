According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is (num + 1), `r` is r, `k` is k, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `num` should be considered, which is (num + 1) + 1 = num + 2. 
Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`l` is (num + 2), `r` is r, `k` is k, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + (num + 1)) % MOD**.
