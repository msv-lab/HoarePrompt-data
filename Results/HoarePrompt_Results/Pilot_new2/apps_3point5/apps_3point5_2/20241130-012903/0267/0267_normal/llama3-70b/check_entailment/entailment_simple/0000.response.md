Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by using dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the sum of numbers from l to r that contain at most k different digits. The count function calculates the total count of such numbers, and the func_1 function computes the required sum by taking the difference between the count of numbers in the range [l, r] and the count of numbers in the range [1, l-1]. The program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.
