Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears by finding the minimum of the possible number of compotes that can be made with each type of fruit, based on the ratio of 1:2:4. It then calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the minimum number of compotes with the respective ratio (1, 2, or 4) for each fruit. This ensures that the compote is made with whole fruits and in the correct ratio as specified in the problem description. The program covers all possible cases and accurately calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to cook the compote.
