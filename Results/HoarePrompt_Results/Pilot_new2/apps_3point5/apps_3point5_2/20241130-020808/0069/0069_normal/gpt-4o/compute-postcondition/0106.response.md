Postcondition: ***prefix_balances is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values, `i` is equal to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, each element in prefix_balances is the sum of the previous element and 1 if the corresponding element in string s is '0', otherwise it subtracts 1 from the previous element, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is increased by 3, `b` is equal to `n`, and if (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, the program continues.***
