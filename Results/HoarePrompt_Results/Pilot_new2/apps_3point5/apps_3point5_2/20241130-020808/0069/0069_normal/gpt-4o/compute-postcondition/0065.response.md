Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the program variables are in the following state: `x` is obtained from the value of `data` at index 1, `T` remains greater than 0, `index` is equal to 6 plus `n`, `results` contains the appended values of `count`, `n` is obtained from the value of `data` at index 0, `s` is a string obtained from the value of `data` at index 2, `balance` is equal to the count of '0' in `s` minus the count of '1' in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values after the loop finishes execution, `count` variable has been appended to the `results` list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `T` remains greater than 0, `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is either 0 or 1, and `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element. Additionally, the value of `x - b` is divisible by `balance` and the result is non-negative.***
