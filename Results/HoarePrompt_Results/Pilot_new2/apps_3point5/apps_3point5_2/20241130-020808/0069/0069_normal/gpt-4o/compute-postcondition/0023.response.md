Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing 0, `n` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 0, `x` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 1, `s` is a string obtained from the value of `data` at index 2, `balance` is the result of counting '0' in `s` minus counting '1' in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with correct values after the loop finishes execution. In addition, after entering the if condition and going to the else block, the current value of `balance` remains 0, and `x` is not in `prefix_balances.**
