For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `data` is a list of strings with at least 3 elements
- `T` is greater than 0
- `index` is 0
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 0
- `x` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 1
- `s` is a string obtained from the value of `data` at index 2
- `balance` is correctly calculated
- `prefix_balances` is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values after the loop finishes execution
- `n` is greater than 0
- `balance` is not equal to 0
- `count` is 0

State: **`data` is a list of strings with at least 3 elements, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 0, `x` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 1, `s` is a string obtained from the value of `data` at index 2, `balance` is correctly calculated, `prefix_balances` is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values after the loop finishes execution, `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0**
