Postcondition: ***prefix_balances is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values, i is equal to n, n is the total number of elements in prefix_balances list, each element in prefix_balances is the sum of the previous element and 1 if the corresponding element in string s is '0', otherwise it subtracts 1 from the previous element. If balance is 0, and x is in prefix_balances, the results list now contains -1 at the end. If x is not in prefix_balances, the results list contains a single element with the value 0. After the else block execution, count will be equal to the number of times the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied for each b in prefix_balances. The values of prefix_balances, i, n, balance, x may have changed based on how many elements in prefix_balances satisfy the condition in the loop. If no elements in prefix_balances satisfy the condition, count will remain 0. results.append(count)***
