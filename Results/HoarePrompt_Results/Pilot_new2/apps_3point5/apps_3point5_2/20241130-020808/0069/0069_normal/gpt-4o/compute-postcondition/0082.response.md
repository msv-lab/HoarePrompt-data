According to the code, the loop will execute for values of i from 1 to n (inclusive). Since the loop starts with i = 1 and goes up to n, the prefix_balances list should have n+1 integers in it with correct values at the start of the loop. The other variables should remain the same as described in the initial state.

State: **Output State: prefix_balances is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values, `i` is 1, `n` is the total number of elements in prefix_balances list**
