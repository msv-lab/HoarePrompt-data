Postcondition: ***`data` is a list of strings with at least 3 elements, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 0, `x` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 1, `s` is a string obtained from the value of `data` at index 2, `balance` is correctly calculated, `prefix_balances` is a list of n+2 integers with the correct values, `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is increased by 1,  if ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0), then the current state of the program variables satisfies the if condition and `count` is increased by 2.***
