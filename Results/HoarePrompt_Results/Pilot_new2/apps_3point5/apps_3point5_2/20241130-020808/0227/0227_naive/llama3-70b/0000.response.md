Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program reads the input values, sorts them in ascending order, and then iterates through the list to determine the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables required according to the problem description, considering the condition that each number in the sequence should be distinct. The logic of checking if a[i] is equal to a[i-1] * 2 ensures that the sequence of operations can be performed as described. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
