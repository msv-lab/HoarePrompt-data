According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added, `assigned` is not empty and contains the element `a[i]`, `m` is 3, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `can_form` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added, `assigned` is not empty and contains the element `a[i]`, `m` is 3, `i` is 3, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `can_form` is False**
