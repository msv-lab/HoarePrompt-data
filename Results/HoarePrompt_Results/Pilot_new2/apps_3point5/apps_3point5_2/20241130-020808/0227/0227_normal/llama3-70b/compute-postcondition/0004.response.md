According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. The loop will iterate from 1 to n-1. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order does not affect the execution of the loop, so it remains the same. The value of `m` is not used in the loop, so it also remains the same. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1**
