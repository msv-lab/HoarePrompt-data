Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned contains the last element of list a, m is 1, i is 1, can_form is True, and x is the last element of list a. If a[i] - x is in assigned, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. can_form is False***
