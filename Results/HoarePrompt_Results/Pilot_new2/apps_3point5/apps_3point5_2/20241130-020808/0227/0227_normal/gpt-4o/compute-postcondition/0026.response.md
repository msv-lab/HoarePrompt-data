According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values in the list 'assigned'. Since we are iterating over 'assigned', it must have at least one element for the loop to execute. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in 'assigned'. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added, assigned is not empty, m is 2, i is 2, x is the last element of list a, can_form is False**
