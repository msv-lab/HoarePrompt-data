The function `func_1` takes two parameters:  `n`, a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a`, a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It then sorts the list `a`, iterates through the elements, and calculates the maximum number of times `can_form` was False. Here, `can_form` is True if the difference between the last element of `a` and another element in `a` is present in the list. The function returns this maximum count.
