#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23) and a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    assigned = set()
    assigned.add(a[0])
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        
        if not can_form:
            m += 1
        
        assigned.add(a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers with all elements added, assigned contains all elements of list a, m is the maximum number of times `can_form` was False, i is n, x is a[n-1], can_form is True if a[n-1] - x is in assigned
    return m
    #The program returns the maximum number of times `can_form` was False, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers, x is the last element of list a, and can_form is True if the difference between a[n-1] and x is in the list a
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters:  `n`, a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a`, a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It then sorts the list `a`, iterates through the elements, and calculates the maximum number of times `can_form` was False. Here, `can_form` is True if the difference between the last element of `a` and another element in `a` is present in the list. The function returns this maximum count.
