Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function that reads in a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list and iterates through it to count the number of times an element is not exactly double the previous element. The final count `m` is printed unless it exceeds 23, in which case -1 is printed. This logic correctly determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations as per the problem description. The program covers all potential cases and outputs the correct result based on the given requirements.
