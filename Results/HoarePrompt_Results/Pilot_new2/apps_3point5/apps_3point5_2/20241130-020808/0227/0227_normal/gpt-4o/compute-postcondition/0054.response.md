Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n+1 distinct positive integers with the last element added, `assigned` is not empty and contains the element `a[i+1]`, `m` is 3, `i` is 4, `x` is `a[i+1]`, `can_form` is True if a[i+1] - x is in assigned. If a[i] - x is in assigned, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
