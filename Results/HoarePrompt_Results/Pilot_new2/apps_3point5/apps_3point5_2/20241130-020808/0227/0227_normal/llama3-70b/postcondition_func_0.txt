The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list and iterates through it to count the number of times an element is not exactly double the previous element. The final count `m` is printed unless it exceeds 23, in which case -1 is printed. The function does not explicitly return a value but provides output based on the calculated count `m`.
