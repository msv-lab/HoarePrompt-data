According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is within the range `(1, k + 1)`. The loop will run from 1 to k (inclusive). Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` must be assigned integer values where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`. Since `seen` is an empty set, there is no specific adjustment needed for it. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `seen` is an empty set**.
