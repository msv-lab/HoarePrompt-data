According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, `seen_remainders` needs to be updated with the new remainder, and `remainder` should be calculated for the new `i`.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is less than `n`; `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainder of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` ≤ `k`; `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`. The remainder of `n` modulo `i` is not in `seen_remainders`.**
