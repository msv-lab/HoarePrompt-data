Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two integer inputs `n` and `k` and checks if all remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. It uses a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders seen so far and returns 'No' if a duplicate remainder is found. If no duplicates are found, it returns 'Yes'. Additionally, the code correctly handles the edge case where `k` is equal to 1, as it returns 'Yes' without entering the loop to avoid division by zero. 

The output hints also agree with the code and further confirm that the function is correctly implemented. Therefore, based on the code logic, the description, and the output hints, the code is correct for all potential cases.
