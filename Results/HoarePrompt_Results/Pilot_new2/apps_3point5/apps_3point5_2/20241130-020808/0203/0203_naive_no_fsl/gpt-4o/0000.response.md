Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It simulates the voting process between the depublicans and remocrats by maintaining two queues for each faction. It then iterates through the queues, moving the employee's index based on the comparison of their indices until only one faction has employees left. The program then prints the outcome correctly based on the remaining queue. The code covers all possible cases and follows the rules of the voting procedure described in the problem statement.
