Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `fractions` composed of characters 'D' or 'R'. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' characters in the string. If the count of 'D' is greater than the count of 'R', it prints 'D'. Otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function processes the input character sequence based on the specified constraints. However, the function lacks explicit return values and handles input processing and comparison logic only. **
