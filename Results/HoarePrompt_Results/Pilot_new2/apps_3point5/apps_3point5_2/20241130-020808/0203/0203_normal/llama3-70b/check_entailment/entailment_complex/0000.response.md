Correctness: **True**

The program reads the number of employees `n` and their corresponding fractions as input. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats) in the fraction string. Finally, it compares the counts and prints 'D' if depublicans have more votes, and 'R' if remocrats have more votes. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, where the program is required to predict the outcome of the vote based on the fractions of the employees and the order of their statements. The program iterates through the employees and correctly determines the final outcome of the vote. Therefore, the program is correct.
