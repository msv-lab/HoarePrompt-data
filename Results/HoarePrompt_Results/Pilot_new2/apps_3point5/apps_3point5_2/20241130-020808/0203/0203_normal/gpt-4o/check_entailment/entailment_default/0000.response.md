Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The implementation accurately simulates the voting process where each employee makes a statement, denies others from voting, and continues until only one employee is left to vote. The code maintains separate queues for 'D' and 'R' employees, pops indices from the queues, and adds them back with an offset of `n`. The condition to check which queue to process next ensures the correct outcome of the vote. The code handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement.
