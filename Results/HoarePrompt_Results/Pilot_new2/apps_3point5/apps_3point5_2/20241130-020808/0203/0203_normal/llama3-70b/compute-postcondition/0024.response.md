The function `func` does not accept any explicit parameters. The function is responsible for processing a sequence of input characters, either 'D' or 'R', based on the specified constraints. The function should handle a positive integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, representing the length of the input character sequence.

The functionality of the function `func` is to process the input character sequence of length `n`, consisting of only 'D' or 'R', and perform a specific operation based on the sequence. The function does not explicitly return any value, as the processing of the input characters is the main objective of the function.
