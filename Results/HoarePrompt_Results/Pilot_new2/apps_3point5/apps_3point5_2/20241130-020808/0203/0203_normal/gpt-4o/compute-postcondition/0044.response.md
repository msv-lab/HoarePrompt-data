Postcondition: ***n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string. After the loop executes, d_queue and r_queue are empty. The loop will execute as long as both d_queue and r_queue are not empty. After the loop finishes, d_index and r_index will contain the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters respectively in the order they appeared in the input string. If d_index is less than r_index, a new element will be added to d_queue which is equal to the previous d_index plus n. If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, r_queue will have r_index + n appended to it. If d_queue is not empty, the code snippet prints 'D' but does not affect any other variables. If d_queue is empty, the program will not enter the loop and the output state remains unchanged.***
