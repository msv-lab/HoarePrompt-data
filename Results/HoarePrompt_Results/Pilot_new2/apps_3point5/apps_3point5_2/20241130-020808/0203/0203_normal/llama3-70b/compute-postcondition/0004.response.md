According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `fractions`. If fractions is a non-empty string, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, depublicans is 0, and remocrats is 0. To ensure the loop executes, fractions must be a non-empty string, and the loop will start with the first fraction in the string.
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, fractions is a non-empty string, depublicans is 0, remocrats is 0, fraction is the first fraction in the string**
