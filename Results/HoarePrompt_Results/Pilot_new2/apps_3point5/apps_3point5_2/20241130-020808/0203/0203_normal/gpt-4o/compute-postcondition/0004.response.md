According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `votes` string. Since `votes` is a string obtained by stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces from the input, it means it must have at least one character. 

For the loop to execute, the `votes` string must not be empty, and the loop will start at the first character of the `votes` string.

State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string, d_queue is an empty list, r_queue is an empty list, i is 0, v is the first character of the `votes` string**
