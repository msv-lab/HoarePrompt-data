According to the code, the loop execution depends on the length of the `votes` string. If there are more characters to process, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the index of the next character to be processed. We need to adjust the state for the next iteration by incrementing `i` and checking if there are more characters left in the string to process.
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string with more characters, i is the index of the next character to be processed + 1**
