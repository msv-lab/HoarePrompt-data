Postcondition: ***n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string, d_queue has a new element added which is equal to d_index + n, r_queue contains the result of appending the value of r_index + n. If d_index < r_index, a new element is added to d_queue which is equal to the sum of the previous value of d_index and n. Otherwise, r_queue contains the result of appending the value of r_index + n.***
