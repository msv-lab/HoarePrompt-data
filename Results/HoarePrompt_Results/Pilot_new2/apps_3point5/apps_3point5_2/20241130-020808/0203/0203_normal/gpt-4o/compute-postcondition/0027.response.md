According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. For the loop to execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` need to still contain elements at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string, d_queue and r_queue are not empty.**
