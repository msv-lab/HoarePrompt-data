#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: n, m, k, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. a and b are distinct numbers.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n, m, k, a, b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. a and b are distinct numbers. block_a is the block number of location a, floor_a is the floor number of location a. block_b is the block number of location b, floor_b is the floor number of location b. If floor_a == 1, time_to_exit is 0. Otherwise, time_to_exit is equal to 10 + (floor_a - 1)

    #The program returns the total time taken to move from location a to location b, considering all the given conditions and calculations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters `n, m, k, a, b`, where `n, m, k, a, and b` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. Additionally, `a` and `b` are distinct numbers. The function calculates the total time taken to move from location `a` to location `b`, considering the floor and block numbers of the locations, as well as walking times and exit times. The total time includes the time to exit, minimum walk time between blocks, and time to reach the target floor.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: apartment is an integer representing the apartment number where Edward or Natasha live.**
def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #The program returns the block number and the floor number where Edward or Natasha live, calculated based on the given formula
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `get_location` accepts an integer parameter `apartment` representing the apartment number where Edward or Natasha live. It then calculates and returns the block number and the floor number where Edward or Natasha live based on a given formula. The function accurately computes the block and floor numbers as described in the annotations.
