Output State: **`min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is equal to the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then the current value of `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`.**
