Postcondition: ***Output State: `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i` are increased by 1, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i` are increased by 1, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
