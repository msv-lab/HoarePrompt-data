According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and the current value of `wait_time`. `chosen_route` is updated to `i` + 1 if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`. All other variables remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`min_wait_time` is updated, `chosen_route` is updated if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `i` is increased by 1, all other variables remain unchanged**
