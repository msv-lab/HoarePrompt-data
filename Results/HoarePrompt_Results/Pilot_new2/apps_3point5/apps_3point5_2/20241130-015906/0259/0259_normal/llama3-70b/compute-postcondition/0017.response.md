Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `buses` list contains bus routes with arrival time `s_i` and interval `d_i` for each route, `s` and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input for the last iteration of the loop, `min_time` is equal to the current value of `time`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `time` is the result of `(t - s) % d` calculation where the current value of `time` is less than `min_time`.**
