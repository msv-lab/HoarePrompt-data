Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates through the list of bus routes and calculates the minimum wait time for each route based on the input time `t`. It then determines the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time and returns that index starting from 1. The function aims to assist Serval in choosing the bus route with the shortest wait time. However, the code does not handle scenarios where two bus routes have the same minimum wait time. It selects the first encountered route in such cases.
