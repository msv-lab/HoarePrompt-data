Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input for the number of bus routes, the specific time Serval goes to the station, and the arrival times and intervals for each bus route. It then calculates the time until the next bus arrives based on the input time and bus schedules, and prints the index of the bus route with the shortest waiting time. The logic implemented in the program matches the requirements specified in the problem description for determining which bus route Serval will use. The program correctly outputs the index of the bus route that Serval will get on based on the provided input.
