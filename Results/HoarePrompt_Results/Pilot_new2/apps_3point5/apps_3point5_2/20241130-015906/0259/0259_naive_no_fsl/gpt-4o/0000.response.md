Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the waiting time for each bus route based on the input time `t` and the arrival time and interval of each bus route.
2. It then selects the bus route with the minimum waiting time, which is in line with the problem description.
3. The program reads the input correctly, processes it, and outputs the correct bus route number according to the problem statement.
4. The logic of the program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that the correct bus route is selected.
