Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer input between 0 and 99 and converts it into its word representation. It correctly handles all cases mentioned in the problem description, such as printing the word representation of the ones place if the input is less than 10, printing the word from the 'teens' list if the input is between 10 and 19, and printing the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the ones place value if applicable for numbers between 20 and 99. The program follows the problem description accurately for all cases.
