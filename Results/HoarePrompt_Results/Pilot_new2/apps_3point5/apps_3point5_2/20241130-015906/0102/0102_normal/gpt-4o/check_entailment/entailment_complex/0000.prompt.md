You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

You can find all you need to know about English numerals in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99.**
def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven',
    'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy',
    'eighty', 'ninety']
    if (0 <= n <= 9) :
        return ones[n]
        #The program returns the string representing the integer value of n in the list 'ones'
    else :
        if (11 <= n <= 19) :
            return teens[n - 10]
            #The program returns the string from the 'teens' list at index n-10, where n is an integer such that 11 <= n <= 19
        else :
            if (10 <= n <= 99) :
                if (n % 10 == 0) :
                    return tens[n // 10]
                    #The program returns the string from the 'tens' list at the index n//10, where n is an integer between 10 and 99 inclusive and n % 10 equals 0
                else :
                    return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
                    #The program returns the combination of the string in the 'tens' list at index n // 10 and the string in the 'ones' list at index n % 10, separated by a hyphen '-'
            #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones is a list containing the strings 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'; teens is a list containing the strings 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen'; tens is a list containing strings 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety'. The value of n is not between 11 and 19, and n is not between 10 and 99
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones is a list containing the strings 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'; teens is a list containing the strings 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen'; tens is a list containing strings 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety'. The value of n is not between 11 and 19, and n is not between 10 and 99
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones is a list containing the strings 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'; teens is a list containing the strings 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen'; tens is a list containing strings 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety'. The value of n is not between 11 and 19, and n is not between 10 and 99
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` between 0 and 99. It then returns different strings based on the value of `n` as follows: 
- If n is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representing the integer value of n in the list 'ones'.
- If n is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string from the 'teens' list at index n-10.
- If n is between 10 and 99 inclusive and n % 10 equals 0, the function returns the string from the 'tens' list at the index n//10.
- If n is between 10 and 99 inclusive and n % 10 does not equal 0, the function returns the combination of the string in the 'tens' list at index n // 10 and the string in the 'ones' list at index n % 10, separated by a hyphen '-'.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
