Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer with a range of 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `k` is a non-negative integer with a range of 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The function calculates the positive integer x by multiplying n with a value derived from `k` and `n`, and returns this value. **
