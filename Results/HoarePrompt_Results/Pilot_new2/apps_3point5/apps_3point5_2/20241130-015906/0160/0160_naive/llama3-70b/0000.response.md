Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the list A after the given operations. 
1. The program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A.
2. Then, the program iterates up to the square root of the gcd and checks if the gcd is divisible by each number in that range, updating the max_divisor accordingly.
3. The program finally outputs the max_divisor, which is the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element in A.
4. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases within the constraints provided.
