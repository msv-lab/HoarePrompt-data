Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the elements of A and then finds the divisors of the sum of A. It checks if there exists a divisor such that it divides every element of A after the operations. If such a divisor is found, it prints it and breaks out of the loop. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem description.
