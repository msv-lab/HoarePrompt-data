Correctness: **True**

The program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list A. Then, it iterates over all numbers up to the square root of the gcd and finds the maximum divisor that can divide the gcd. This approach ensures that the program finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
