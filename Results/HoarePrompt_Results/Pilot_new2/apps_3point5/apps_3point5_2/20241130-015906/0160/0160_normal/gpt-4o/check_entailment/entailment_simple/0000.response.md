Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(lst)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of integers. This is useful in determining the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The function correctly calculates the gcd of the list of integers given as input and returns it.
2. `func_2(x)`: This function calculates the divisors of a given number and returns them in reverse order. This is useful in determining all possible divisors of x, which is needed to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The function correctly calculates the divisors of x and returns them in reverse order.

The functions align with the problem description and provide the necessary functionality to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
