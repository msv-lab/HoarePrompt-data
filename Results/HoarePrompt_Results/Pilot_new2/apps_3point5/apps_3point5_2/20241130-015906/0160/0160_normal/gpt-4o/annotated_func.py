    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `gcd_result` is equal to the greatest common divisor of all elements in `lst`, `lst` must have at least one element
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list 'lst', where 'lst' must have at least one element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list 'lst' and calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list. The list 'lst' must have at least one element for the function to work correctly. The function uses the math module to find the greatest common divisor.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a list of N integers, N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500. Each element of A is an integer between 1 and 10^6. K is an integer between 0 and 10^9.**
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` is a list of N integers, N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, each element of `A` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `x` is greater than or equal to 1. After the loop finishes executing, `divisors` contains all the divisors of x.
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of all divisors of x in reverse order
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_2` takes a parameter `x`, which is a list of N integers (2 <= N <= 500) where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6. It also accepts an integer `K` (0 <= K <= 10^9). The function computes all the divisors of `x` and returns them in a sorted list in reverse order.

Note: The code correctly computes the divisors of `x` and returns them in reverse order as specified in the annotations. The edge cases of negative numbers for `x` or `K` are not explicitly handled in the annotations or code.
