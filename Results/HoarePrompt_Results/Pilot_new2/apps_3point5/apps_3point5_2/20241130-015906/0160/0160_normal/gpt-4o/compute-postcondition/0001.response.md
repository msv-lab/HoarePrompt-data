According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `x` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, you need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`A` is a list of N integers, N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, each element of `A` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `divisors` is an empty set, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1**
