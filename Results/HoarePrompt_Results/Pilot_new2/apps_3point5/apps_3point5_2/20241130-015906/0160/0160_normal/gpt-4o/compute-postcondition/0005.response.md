Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of N integers, N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, each element of `A` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of x, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the current values of x, i such that (x % i == 0), are divisors of x, and the set `divisors` now includes the values obtained by dividing x by each element i in the set.***
