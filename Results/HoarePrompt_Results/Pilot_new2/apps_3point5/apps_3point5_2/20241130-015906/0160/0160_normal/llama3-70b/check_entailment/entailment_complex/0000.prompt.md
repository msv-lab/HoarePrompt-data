You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N.
You can perform the following operation between 0 and K times (inclusive):
 - Choose two integers i and j such that i \neq j, each between 1 and N (inclusive). Add 1 to A_i and -1 to A_j, possibly producing a negative element.
Compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Here a positive integer x divides an integer y if and only if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 500
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_{N-1} A_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3
8 20

-----Sample Output-----
7

7 will divide every element of A if, for example, we perform the following operation:
 - Choose i = 2, j = 1. A becomes (7, 21).
We cannot reach the situation where 8 or greater integer divides every element of A.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer greater than or equal to 2, K is an integer greater than or equal to 0, A_i are positive integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i.**
def func():
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    gcd = A[0]
    for i in range(1, N):
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, A[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is an integer greater than or equal to 2, K is an integer greater than or equal to 0, A_i are positive integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, N and K are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces, A is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, gcd is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list A.
    max_divisor = gcd
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1):
        if gcd % i == 0:
            max_divisor = max(max_divisor, i)
            if i * i != gcd:
                max_divisor = max(max_divisor, gcd // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes executing, N, K, A_i are positive integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i. N is an integer greater than or equal to 2, K is an integer greater than or equal to 0. A is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces. gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list A. The square root of gcd is at least 1. i will be equal to the square root of gcd. After the if else block executes for each valid i, max_divisor is updated to the maximum of its current value and gcd divided by i.
    print(max_divisor)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two integers N, K and a list A of N positive integers. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. After that, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to its square root and prints it. The function does not directly return any value, but it effectively calculates and outputs the maximum divisor of the gcd based on the input values.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
