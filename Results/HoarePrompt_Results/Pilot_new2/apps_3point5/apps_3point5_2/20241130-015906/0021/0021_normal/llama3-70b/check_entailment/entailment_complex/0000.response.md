Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, then calculates the maximum possible distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list. This is achieved by finding the positions of 1 and `n`, calculating the distance between them, and considering the distance from the ends of the list. Finally, the program prints the maximum of these two distances.

The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases as it ensures that the minimum and maximum elements are as far as possible from each other after exactly one swap, thus maximizing the distance between them.
