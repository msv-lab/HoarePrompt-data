Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` to the input values obtained by splitting the input string; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in list `a`; `dist1` is the absolute value of 0 minus `max_pos`; `dist2` is the absolute value of `n - 1 - max_pos`; `dist3` is the absolute value of 0 minus `min_pos`; `dist4` is the absolute value of `n - 1 - min_pos`; `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, `dist4`. `max_distance` is printed.**
