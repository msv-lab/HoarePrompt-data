Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum positions of the elements 1 and n in the permutation. It then calculates the distances between these elements and the first and last positions in the list. Finally, it outputs the maximum distance that can be achieved by performing one swap. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
