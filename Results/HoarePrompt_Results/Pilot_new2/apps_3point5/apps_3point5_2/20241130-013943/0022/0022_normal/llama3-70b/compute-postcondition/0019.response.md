Functionality: ** The function `func` takes user input for a string `s`, checks if `s` is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome, otherwise prints 'NIE'. The function operates on a string `s` of length at least 1 and at most 1000, consisting of only English letters. If `s` is a palindrome, it sets `is_spalindrome` to True, otherwise False, and outputs the result accordingly.**
