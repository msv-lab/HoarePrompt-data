Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if a given string is "s-palindrome" by iterating through the string and comparing characters at symmetric positions. It returns True if all characters at symmetric positions are equal, indicating that the string is a "s-palindrome", and False otherwise. The program handles both the cases when the string has an odd or even length, accurately identifying palindrome strings. The program also correctly handles the case when the string is empty.

Although the program does not explicitly mention handling non-English letters or special characters, it does not affect the correctness in the context of the provided problem description since the problem statement only specifies English letters. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and correctly determines if a given string is "s-palindrome".
