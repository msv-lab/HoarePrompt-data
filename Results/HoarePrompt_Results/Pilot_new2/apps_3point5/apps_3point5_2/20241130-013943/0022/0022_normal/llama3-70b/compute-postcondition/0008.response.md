According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a palindrome string, `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_palindrome` is True. If `s[i] != s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_palindrome` is set to False. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`s` is a palindrome string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is incremented by 1**
