Postcondition: ***`s` is a string containing only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1. The characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in string `s` are equal. If the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in string `s` are not equal, the function returns False. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
