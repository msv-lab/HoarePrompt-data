Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly defines the function func_1(s) that checks if the given string is an "s-palindrome" by comparing characters from the start and end of the string. It returns True if the string is symmetric about the middle and False otherwise. The function is then called with the input string s and prints "TAK" if the string is an "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it handles all cases where the given string is either symmetric or not symmetric about the middle.
