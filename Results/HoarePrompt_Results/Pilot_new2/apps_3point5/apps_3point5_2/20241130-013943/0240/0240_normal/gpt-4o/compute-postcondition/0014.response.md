The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. `chars` is a string representing a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, while `sub` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `chars`. The function generates all possible numbers that can be formed by the digits in `chars` that contain the substring `sub`. The function then returns a list of these possible numbers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. It generates all possible numbers that can be formed by the digits in `chars` that contain the substring `sub`, and returns a list of these numbers.**
