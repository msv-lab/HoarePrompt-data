The function is_valid_number accepts two parameters, num_str and sub, both representing very large integers with possible leading zeroes. It returns True if sub is a substring of num_str and the length of num_str is equal to n_len. However, the annotation mentions n_len, which is not defined in the function. This could potentially lead to an error or unexpected behavior since the variable n_len is not present within the function. Additionally, it does not handle cases where num_str or sub are empty strings. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to check if sub is a substring of num_str, assuming n_len is a predefined variable and not accounting for empty string cases.
