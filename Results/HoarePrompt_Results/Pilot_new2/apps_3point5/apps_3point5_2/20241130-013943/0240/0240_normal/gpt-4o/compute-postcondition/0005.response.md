According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `chars` and `perm`. If there are more permutations left to be generated, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` represents the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string obtained by joining the first permutation of `chars`. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` represents the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string obtained by joining the next permutation of `chars`. If the current `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number` with `sub`, then the `candidate` has been yielded.**
