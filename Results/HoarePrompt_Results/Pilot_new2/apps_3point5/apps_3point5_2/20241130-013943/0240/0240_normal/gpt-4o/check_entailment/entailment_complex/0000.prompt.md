You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of digits and sub is a substring of s.**
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes executing, `s` is a string of digits, `sub` is a substring of `s` with at least 1 character, `n_len` is the difference between the length of `s` and the length of `sub`, `s_counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each digit in the string `s`, `sub_counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each digit in the substring `sub`. The loop subtracts the count of occurrences of each digit in `sub_counter` from the corresponding count in `s_counter`.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the smallest number in the list of `possible_numbers`, which has been updated to reflect the new smallest_number value
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `s`, a string of digits, and `sub`, a substring of `s`. It then calculates the difference in lengths between `s` and `sub`, updates the counts of characters in `s` using Counter objects, generates possible numbers from the remaining characters after subtracting the counts of `sub_counter` from `s_counter`, and finally returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers. The function does not handle cases where the input `s` or `sub` is empty or contains non-digit characters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a string representing a very large integer and sub is a substring of num_str. Both num_str and sub can contain leading zeroes.**
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if sub is a substring of num_str and the length of num_str is equal to n_len
#Overall this is what the function does:The function is_valid_number accepts two parameters, num_str and sub, both representing very large integers with possible leading zeroes. It returns True if sub is a substring of num_str and the length of num_str is equal to n_len. However, the annotation mentions n_len, which is not defined in the function. This could potentially lead to an error or unexpected behavior since the variable n_len is not present within the function. Additionally, it does not handle cases where num_str or sub are empty strings. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to check if sub is a substring of num_str, assuming n_len is a predefined variable and not accounting for empty string cases.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a string representing a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, sub is a string representing a non-empty substring of chars.**
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: chars is the original non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, sub is the original non-empty substring of chars, all permutations of chars have been iterated through, and all valid numbers with respect to sub have been yielded as candidates
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a string representing a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, and `sub`, a string representing a non-empty substring of `chars`. It generates all possible numbers by permuting the digits in `chars` and yields those numbers that contain the substring `sub`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
