Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string containing the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are present in `t_set` along with the next character `c`, `c` represents the next character in `s`. If the next character `c` in `s` is in the set `t_set`, the next character `c` is concatenated with `n`.***
