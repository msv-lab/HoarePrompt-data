Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` represents the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string obtained by joining the next permutation of `chars` where `candidate` equals ''.join(perm), and the next permutation of `chars` is yielded and `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub**.
