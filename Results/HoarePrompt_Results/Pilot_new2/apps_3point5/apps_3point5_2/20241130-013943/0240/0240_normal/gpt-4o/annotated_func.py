#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of digits and sub is a substring of s.**
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes executing, `s` is a string of digits, `sub` is a substring of `s` with at least 1 character, `n_len` is the difference between the length of `s` and the length of `sub`, `s_counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each digit in the string `s`, `sub_counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each digit in the substring `sub`. The loop subtracts the count of occurrences of each digit in `sub_counter` from the corresponding count in `s_counter`.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the smallest number in the list of `possible_numbers`, which has been updated to reflect the new smallest_number value
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `s`, a string of digits, and `sub`, a substring of `s`. It then calculates the difference in lengths between `s` and `sub`, updates the counts of characters in `s` using Counter objects, generates possible numbers from the remaining characters after subtracting the counts of `sub_counter` from `s_counter`, and finally returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers. The function does not handle cases where the input `s` or `sub` is empty or contains non-digit characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a string representing a very large integer and sub is a substring of num_str. Both num_str and sub can contain leading zeroes.**
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if sub is a substring of num_str and the length of num_str is equal to n_len
#Overall this is what the function does:The function is_valid_number accepts two parameters, num_str and sub, both representing very large integers with possible leading zeroes. It returns True if sub is a substring of num_str and the length of num_str is equal to n_len. However, the annotation mentions n_len, which is not defined in the function. This could potentially lead to an error or unexpected behavior since the variable n_len is not present within the function. Additionally, it does not handle cases where num_str or sub are empty strings. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to check if sub is a substring of num_str, assuming n_len is a predefined variable and not accounting for empty string cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a string representing a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, sub is a string representing a non-empty substring of chars.**
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: chars is the original non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, sub is the original non-empty substring of chars, all permutations of chars have been iterated through, and all valid numbers with respect to sub have been yielded as candidates
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a string representing a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, and `sub`, a string representing a non-empty substring of `chars`. It generates all possible numbers by permuting the digits in `chars` and yields those numbers that contain the substring `sub`.
