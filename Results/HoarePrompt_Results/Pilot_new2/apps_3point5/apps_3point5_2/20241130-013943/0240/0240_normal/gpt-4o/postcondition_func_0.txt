The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `s`, a string of digits, and `sub`, a substring of `s`. It then calculates the difference in lengths between `s` and `sub`, updates the counts of characters in `s` using Counter objects, generates possible numbers from the remaining characters after subtracting the counts of `sub_counter` from `s_counter`, and finally returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers. The function does not handle cases where the input `s` or `sub` is empty or contains non-digit characters.
