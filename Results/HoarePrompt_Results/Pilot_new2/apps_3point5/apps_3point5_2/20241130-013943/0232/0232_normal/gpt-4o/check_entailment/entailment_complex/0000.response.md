Correctness: **True**

The program properly implements the logic required to determine if an interval with the prescribed color counts exists. It correctly initializes `desired_counts` and `current_counts`, updates the counts of each color in `current_counts` as it iterates through the list of colors, and checks if the conditions for a valid interval are met. The program returns 'YES' if an interval with the prescribed count exists, otherwise it returns 'NO'.

The program follows the problem description by ensuring that the counts of each color in the selected interval match the desired counts specified in the input. It covers all possible cases where a valid interval with the prescribed color counts may exist.
