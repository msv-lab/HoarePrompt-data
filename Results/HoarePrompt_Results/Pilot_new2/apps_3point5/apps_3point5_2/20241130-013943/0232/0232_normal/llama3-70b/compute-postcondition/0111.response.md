Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `found` remains True, `window_counts` contains counts of each color equal to their corresponding targets, `i` is incremented by the total number of colors, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is the total number of colors, `color` is the last color in the list `colors`, and `window_counts[color]` is equal to the count of the last color in the list `colors` if it was not present in the `window_counts` dictionary. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets, the loop or if statement is exited.**
