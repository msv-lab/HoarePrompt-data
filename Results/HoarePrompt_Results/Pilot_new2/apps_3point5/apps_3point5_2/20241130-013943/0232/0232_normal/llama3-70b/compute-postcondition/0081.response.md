Output State: **After the loop executes, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of each color matches the values in the list `counts`. `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the total number of colors, `color` is the last color in the list `colors`, `found` variable is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
