Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors list contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} and is not empty; counts list is populated with integers obtained from splitting the input; color_counts is a dictionary containing color with a count of 0 if color is not in color_counts. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
