Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the values specified in the list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values initialized to 0, `left` is decreased by 1 to the previous value + 1, `right` is in the range of 0 to `n-1`, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` has been incremented by 1. At least one color has a count less than its desired count. If all colors have counts equal to their desired counts, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not have a defined output.**
