Postcondition: ***After the loop executes and `found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of each color matches the values in the list `counts`. `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the total number of colors, `color` is the last color in the list `colors`, and the `break` statement is executed causing the program to exit the loop or if statement.***
