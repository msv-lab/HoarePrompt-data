Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors list contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} and is not empty; counts list is populated with integers obtained from splitting the input; color_counts is an empty dictionary; color is the first color in the colors list. If color is not already in color_counts, then color_counts now contains color and its count is 1.***
