Postcondition: ***min_upvotes is equal to x. max_upvotes is equal to x + z. min_downvotes is equal to y. max_downvotes is equal to y + z. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false, meaning max_upvotes is greater than or equal to min_downvotes. No changes occur in the state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block.***
