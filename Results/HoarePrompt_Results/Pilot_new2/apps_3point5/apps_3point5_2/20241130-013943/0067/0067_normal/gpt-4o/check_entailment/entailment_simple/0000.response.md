Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes Nauuo could receive based on the given input values x, y, and z. Then, it checks if the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, in which case it prints "-", indicating more downvotes. If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, it prints "+", indicating more upvotes. Otherwise, it prints "?" to indicate an uncertain result.

The program handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for each case.
