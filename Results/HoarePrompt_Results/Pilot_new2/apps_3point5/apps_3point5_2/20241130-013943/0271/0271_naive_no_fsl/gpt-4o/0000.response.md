Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the remainder when dividing n by 10 to determine how far n is from the nearest integer ending in zero. It then rounds n to the nearest integer ending in zero based on the value of the remainder. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description provided, and for every possible input, the program outputs the correct result.
