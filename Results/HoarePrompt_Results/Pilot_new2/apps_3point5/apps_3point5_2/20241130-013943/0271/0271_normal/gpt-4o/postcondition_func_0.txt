The function `func` reads an input integer `n`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and then based on the value of the remainder, adjusts `n` to a number that is either lower than or equal to `n` if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, or higher than `n` if the remainder is greater than 5. The function then prints the resulting value. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, it operates under the assumption that `n` is a non-negative integer.
