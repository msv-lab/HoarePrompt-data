Correctness: **True**

The program takes an input integer `n` and rounds it to the nearest integer ending with 0. It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 and then based on the value of the remainder, it rounds `n` to the nearest integer ending with 0. The program correctly follows the problem description as it ensures that the result is always an integer ending with 0, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
