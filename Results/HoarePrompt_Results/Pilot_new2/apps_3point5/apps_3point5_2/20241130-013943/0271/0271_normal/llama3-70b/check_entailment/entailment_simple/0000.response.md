Correctness: **True**

The program correctly rounds the given integer to the nearest integer that ends with 0, as described in the problem. If the input number is already divisible by 10, it remains the same. If the input number is not divisible by 10, it rounds it to the nearest multiple of 10 either by subtracting or adding depending on the modulo result.

The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
