Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two integers `x` and `y` as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the absolute difference between the two side lengths and prints the result, which represents the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` from the triangle of side length `x`. The logic of calculating the absolute difference is correct according to the problem description, and the program handles all potential cases as specified.
