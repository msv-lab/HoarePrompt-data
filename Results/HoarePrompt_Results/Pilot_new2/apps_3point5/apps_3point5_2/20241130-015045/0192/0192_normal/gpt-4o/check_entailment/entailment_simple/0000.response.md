Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y starting from the equilateral triangle of side length x. 

The program first reads the input integers x and y. Then, it calculates the minimum number of seconds required by using the formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2), which is derived from the observation that by decreasing a side length of the triangle by 2, Memory reduces the overall side length by 1. 

This logic is consistent with the problem description as it ensures that the sides of the triangle remain integers and that the triangle remains non-degenerate. The program works for all potential cases within the given constraints and provides the correct output.
