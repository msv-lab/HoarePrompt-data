Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly reads two integers `x` and `y`, then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting equilateral triangle of side length x. The calculation ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2) accounts for the steps needed to transition from the starting triangle to the ending triangle.

The program follows the problem description as it ensures that at any moment of time, the length of each side of the triangle is an integer and the triangle remains non-degenerate. It correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for the transformation and prints the result.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.
