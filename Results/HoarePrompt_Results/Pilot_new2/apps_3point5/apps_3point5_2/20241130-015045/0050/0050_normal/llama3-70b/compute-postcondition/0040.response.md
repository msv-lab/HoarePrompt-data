Postcondition: ***Shares contain the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the updated value of r based on the prices of shares in the list s. i is m+1, m must be greater than 1. If shares > 0, r is increased by the product of shares and b[i], shares become 0. If shares <= 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
