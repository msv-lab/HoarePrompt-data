Postcondition: ***Shares contain the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the updated value of r based on the prices of shares in the list s. i is m-1, m must be greater than 0. If shares > 0, then r is increased by shares multiplied by b[i] and shares is set to 0. If shares <= 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
