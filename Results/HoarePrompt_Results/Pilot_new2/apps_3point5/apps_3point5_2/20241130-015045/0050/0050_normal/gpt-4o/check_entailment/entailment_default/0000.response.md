Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately follows the problem description by reading the input values for the number of shares, prices of shares, and initial investment. 
- It correctly calculates the maximum profit that can be obtained from buying and selling the shares based on the given parameters.
- If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints the initial investment, which aligns with the problem description.
- It calculates the total profit by determining the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial investment, the remaining amount after buying shares, and the total profit from selling the bought shares, which is also in line with the problem description.
- The code handles cases where there are opportunities to buy and sell shares, and ensures the maximum profit is achieved based on the given constraints. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality.
