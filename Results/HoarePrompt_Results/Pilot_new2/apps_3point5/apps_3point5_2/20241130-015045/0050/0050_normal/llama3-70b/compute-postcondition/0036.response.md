According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is m, m must be greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, i is increased by 1 so i becomes m+1. Therefore, m+1 must be less than m for the loop to execute again.

State: **Shares contain the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the updated value of r based on the prices of shares in the list s. i is m+1, m must be greater than 1.**
