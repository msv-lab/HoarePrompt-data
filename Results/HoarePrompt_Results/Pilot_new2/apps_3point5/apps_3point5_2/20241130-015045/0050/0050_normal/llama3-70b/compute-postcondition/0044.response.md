Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `r`, a list of share prices `s`, and a list of share values `b`. It then calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial value of `r` based on the share prices in list `s`. After that, it updates the value of `r` based on share values in list `b`. The final value of `r` is printed as output. The function does not return a specific value and operates within the given constraints.**
