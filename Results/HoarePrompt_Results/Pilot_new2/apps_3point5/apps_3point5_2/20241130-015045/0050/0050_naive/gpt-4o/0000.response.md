Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening based on the given inputs. It considers the scenario where it's optimal not to take any action if the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price. It then calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining bourles after buying shares, and finally computes the total bourles after selling the shares. The logic covers all potential cases and the program outputs the correct result for the provided inputs.
