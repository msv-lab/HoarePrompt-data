The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. It calculates the remainder of the division of the numerator by (10^6 + 3) and the denominator by (10^6 + 3), where the numerator is the product of (total_days - i) for i from 0 to k-1, the denominator is the product of total_days for i from 0 to k-1, and total_days is 2 raised to the power of n.
