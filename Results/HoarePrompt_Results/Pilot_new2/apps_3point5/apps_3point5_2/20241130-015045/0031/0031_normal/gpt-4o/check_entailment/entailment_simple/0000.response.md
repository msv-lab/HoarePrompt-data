Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly follows the problem description. It correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in Udayland given the number of days in a year and the number of people interviewed.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and `func_2` which calculates the probability values as described in the problem.

The program first checks if the number of people interviewed is greater than the total days in a year, in which case it returns 1, 1 as per the problem description.

Then it proceeds to calculate the numerator and denominator for the probability fraction based on the provided formula. It then calculates the probability of not sharing the birthday, total probability, and probability of sharing the birthday. After calculating these values, it reduces them to their simplest form by finding the GCD.

Finally, it prints the reduced values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3 as required.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
