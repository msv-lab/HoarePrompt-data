Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers `n` and `k` as input, representing the number of days in a year and the number of people to be interviewed, respectively.
- The `func_1` function calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in `n` days long year, given `k` people are interviewed.
- The function correctly computes the numerator and denominator by multiplying appropriate values based on the problem description.
- It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) between the numerator and denominator, and divides both by the gcd.
- Finally, it returns the remainders of the division of numerator and denominator by (10^6 + 3) as A and B.
- The code outputs A and B correctly after calling `func_1`.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description and correctly computes the probability as required.
- There are no edge cases identified that the code does not handle, and the output hints also agree with the code's functionality.
