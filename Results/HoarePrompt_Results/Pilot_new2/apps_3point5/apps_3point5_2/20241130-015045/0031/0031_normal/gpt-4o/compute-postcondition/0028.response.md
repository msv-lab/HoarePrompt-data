Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k, shifts k left n times, and returns the resulting value. The MOD value is equal to 1000003. However, there is a missing functionality in the annotations regarding the calculation and printing of the values for A and B. These values are obtained based on the shared and total probabilities, and a function func_1 is used in this calculation. The missing logic here is related to the actual computation of A and B, and their proper handling.**
