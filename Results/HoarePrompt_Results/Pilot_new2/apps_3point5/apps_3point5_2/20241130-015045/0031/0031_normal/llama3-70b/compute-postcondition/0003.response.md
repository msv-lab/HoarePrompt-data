Since the loop is iterating over the range of k, it is necessary that k is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Given the constraints of 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, it is guaranteed that k will always be greater than 0. However, the initial state does not mention anything about the loop variable i, so it needs to be adjusted to i is 0 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days = 2 to the power of n; numerator = 1; denominator = 1, i is 0**
