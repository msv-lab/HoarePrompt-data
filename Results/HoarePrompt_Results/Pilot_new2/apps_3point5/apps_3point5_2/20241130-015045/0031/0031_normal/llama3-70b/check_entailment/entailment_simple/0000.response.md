Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday. The program calculates the probability of no two people having the same birthday, which is not what the problem description asks for. The numerator should be calculated as total_days * (total_days - 1) * ... * (total_days - k + 1) to represent the number of ways in which no two people share the same birthday.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
