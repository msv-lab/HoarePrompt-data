According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to be 2, and `k` must be greater than 2. Additionally, the denominator needs to be updated by multiplying it by total_days.

State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is 2 to the power of n; numerator is (total_days - i)^2; denominator is 2 to the power of n multiplied by total_days; i is 2**.
