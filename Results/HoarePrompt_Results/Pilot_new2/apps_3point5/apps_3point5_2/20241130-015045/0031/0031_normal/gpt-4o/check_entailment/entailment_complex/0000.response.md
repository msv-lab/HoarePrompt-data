Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the Birthday Paradox problem as described in the problem statement. It calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in a group of k people in a year with 2^n days. The code handles the edge cases where k is greater than 2^n and provides the correct output in irreducible fraction form modulo 10^6 + 3. The annotations also align with the logic of the code and provide additional insights into the Euclidean algorithm used to find the greatest common divisor. Overall, the code works as expected for all potential cases based on the problem description and the provided examples.
