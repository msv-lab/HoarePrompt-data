Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland based on the input values of n and k. The program uses the given formula and efficiently calculates the numerator and denominator modulo 10^6 + 3 to find the irreducible fraction A/B. Additionally, the program handles the edge case where k is greater than 2^n by outputting 1 1. 

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
