Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the original values of `n` and `k` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns that value. The function correctly handles the case where one of the input integers is 0 due to the nature of the algorithm, resulting in the function returning the non-zero input value as the greatest common divisor.**
