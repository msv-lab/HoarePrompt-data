According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is k - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to k - 2.
State: **Output State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, min_sum is assigned the value of k * (k + 1) // 2 and is less than or equal to n, d is assigned the value n // (k * (k + 1) // 2), remainder is assigned the value n - d * min_sum - 1, sequence is a list containing elements d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd + 1, i is k - 2**
