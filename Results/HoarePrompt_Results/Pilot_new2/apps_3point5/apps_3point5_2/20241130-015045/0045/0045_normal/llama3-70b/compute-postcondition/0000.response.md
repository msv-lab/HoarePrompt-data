According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the condition `b` evaluates to True. Right before the loop, the only information provided is that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. Since there is no specific information about `b`, we cannot determine what adjustments are required to ensure the loop executes one more time. Therefore, the state remains the same.

State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10**
