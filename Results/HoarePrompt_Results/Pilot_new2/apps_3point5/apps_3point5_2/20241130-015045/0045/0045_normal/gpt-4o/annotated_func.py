    return sequence
    #The program returns a list 'sequence' where each element is d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd, all elements incremented by 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

- Case 1: If the calculated `min_sum` (k * (k + 1) // 2) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.
- Case 2: The function then computes the value of `d` as n // min_sum, calculates the remainder, and generates a sequence list where each element is d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd, with all elements being incremented by 1. The function returns this list as the final output.
