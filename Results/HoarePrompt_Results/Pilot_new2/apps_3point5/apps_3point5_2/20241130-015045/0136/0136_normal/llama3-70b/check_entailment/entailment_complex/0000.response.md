Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description by reading two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and comparing them. It removes any leading zeros from the input integers and then compares them. It prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if they are equal. The annotations provided also accurately describe the behavior of the program.
