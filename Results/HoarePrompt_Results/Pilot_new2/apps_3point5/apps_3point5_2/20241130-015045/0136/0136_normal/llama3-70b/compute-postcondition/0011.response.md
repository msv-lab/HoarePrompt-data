The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses variables `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits. The function returns a value based on the operations performed using these variables `a` and `b`. Since no specific operations or conditions are provided, the exact return value cannot be determined without further information.
