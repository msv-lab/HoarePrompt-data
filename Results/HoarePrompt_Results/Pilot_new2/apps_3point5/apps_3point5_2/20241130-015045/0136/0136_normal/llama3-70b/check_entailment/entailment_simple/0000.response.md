Correctness: **True**

The program takes two very large integers as input and compares them correctly. It removes any leading zeros from the input integers and then compares them. It outputs "<" if the first integer is less than the second, ">" if the first integer is greater than the second, and "=" if they are equal. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
