Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes an integer input `s` in the range 0 to 99 and returns the English word representation of the input number based on its digits. It handles cases where `s` is less than 10, between 10 and 19, and 20 or greater, as described in the problem description. The output is in lowercase letters and uses hyphens as required. The function itself is well-annotated and explains the logic used in each case.
