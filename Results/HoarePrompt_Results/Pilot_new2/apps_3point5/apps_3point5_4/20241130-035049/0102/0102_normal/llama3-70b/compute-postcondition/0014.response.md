Functionality: **The function accepts user input integer `s` in the range 0 to 99. It then prints the English word representation of the input number based on its digits. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word representation from 'one' to 'nine'. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word representation of numbers 'ten' to 'nineteen'. For `s` greater than or equal to 20, it prints the word representation of tens place value followed by the ones place value if non-zero, with a hyphen in between.**
