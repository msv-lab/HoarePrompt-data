Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A, then iterates through all the divisors of the gcd to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it handles all potential cases within the constraints provided. Hence, the program is correct.
