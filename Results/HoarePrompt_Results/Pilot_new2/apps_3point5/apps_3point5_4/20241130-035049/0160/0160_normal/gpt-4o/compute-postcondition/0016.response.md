The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. Parameter constraints are: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all 1 <= i <= N. The function returns all the divisors of the perfect square x in sorted order in descending order, including 1 and x. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, which is a perfect square. It returns all the divisors of x in sorted order in descending order, including 1 and x.**
