Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, gcd is a positive integer, max_divisor is a positive integer equal to max(max_divisor, gcd // i), i is 1. The current value of i divides gcd evenly. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum of the previous max_divisor and gcd divided by i.***
