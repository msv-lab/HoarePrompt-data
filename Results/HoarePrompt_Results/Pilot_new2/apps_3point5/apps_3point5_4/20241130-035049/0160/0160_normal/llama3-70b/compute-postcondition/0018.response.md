According to the loop statement, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 2, `gcd` is a positive integer, `max_divisor` is a positive integer equal to max(max_divisor, gcd // (i-1)), `i` is 1. 

To execute one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `N` remains at least 2
- `gcd` remains a positive integer
- `max_divisor` becomes the maximum of the previous max_divisor and gcd divided by `(i-1)`
- `i` is increased by 1

State: **N is at least 2, gcd is a positive integer, max_divisor is a positive integer equal to max(max_divisor, gcd // (i-1)), i is 2**
