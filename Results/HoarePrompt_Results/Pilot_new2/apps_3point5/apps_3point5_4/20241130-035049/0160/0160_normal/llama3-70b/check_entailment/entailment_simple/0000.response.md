Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input values for N, K, and the list of integers A. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A. After that, it finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A by iterating through all the divisors of the gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor found.

The program follows the problem description accurately as it correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It satisfies the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
