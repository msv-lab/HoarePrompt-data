According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `x` is such that the square root of `x` is an integer. Before the loop starts, you need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all 1 <= i <= N, divisors is an empty set, x must be a perfect square**
