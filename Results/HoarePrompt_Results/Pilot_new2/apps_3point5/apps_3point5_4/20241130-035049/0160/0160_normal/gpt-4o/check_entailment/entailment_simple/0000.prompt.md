You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N.
You can perform the following operation between 0 and K times (inclusive):
 - Choose two integers i and j such that i \neq j, each between 1 and N (inclusive). Add 1 to A_i and -1 to A_j, possibly producing a negative element.
Compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Here a positive integer x divides an integer y if and only if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 500
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_{N-1} A_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3
8 20

-----Sample Output-----
7

7 will divide every element of A if, for example, we perform the following operation:
 - Choose i = 2, j = 1. A becomes (7, 21).
We cannot reach the situation where 8 or greater integer divides every element of A.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer greater than or equal to 2, K is an integer greater than or equal to 0, A_i values are positive integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and all input values are integers.**
def func_1(lst):
    gcd_result = lst[0]
    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is an integer greater than or equal to 2, K is an integer greater than or equal to 0, A_i values are positive integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, gcd_result is equal to the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list lst.
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all positive integers in the list lst, where N is an integer greater than or equal to 2, K is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and A_i values are positive integers between 1 and 10^6

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all 1 <= i <= N.**
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all 1 <= i <= N, x is a perfect square. The set divisors contains all the divisors of x, including 1 and x.
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns all the divisors of the perfect square x in sorted order in descending order, including 1 and x.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
