    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all positive integers in the list lst, where N is an integer greater than or equal to 2, K is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and A_i values are positive integers between 1 and 10^6
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `lst`, where the first element of the list is considered as the initial greatest common divisor. It then iterates through the remaining elements of the list, updating the greatest common divisor accordingly. The function returns the final greatest common divisor calculated from all positive integers in the list `lst`. The function assumes `lst` contains at least two positive integers, and the values in the list are valid positive integers between 1 and 10^6.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all 1 <= i <= N.**

The set divisors contains all the divisors of x, including 1 and x.
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns all the divisors of the perfect square x in sorted order in descending order, including 1 and x.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts a parameter x, which is a perfect square. It calculates and returns all the divisors of x in sorted order in descending order, including 1 and x. The function correctly identifies the divisors of a perfect square x.
