Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first reads the input values correctly.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the waiting time for each bus route based on the given conditions and chooses the route with the minimum waiting time.
3. The program then prints the chosen route correctly.
4. The logic in the code follows the problem description accurately, considering the scenario where the first bus of a route arrives after the time Serval goes to the station and handling the intervals between buses correctly.
5. The program iterates through all bus routes and calculates the waiting time for each, ensuring that the chosen route has the minimum waiting time.
6. The output of the program is the bus route that Serval will use, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
