Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least `i + 2` elements with tuples `(s, d)`, `min_time` is updated to the current value of `time`, `ans` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is the index of the next tuple in `buses`, `s` and `d` are the values from the next tuple in `buses`, `time` is updated to `(t - s) % d`, if `time` is less than `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to the current value of `time`, `ans` is equal to `i + 1`.***
