According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i+1, s_(i+1), d_(i+1)` are positive integers. If the wait time is less than the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i+1` needs to be incremented by 1, and all the variables remain positive integers.
State: **All variables `n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i+2, s_(i+2), d_(i+2)` are positive integers. If the wait time is less than the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 2**.
