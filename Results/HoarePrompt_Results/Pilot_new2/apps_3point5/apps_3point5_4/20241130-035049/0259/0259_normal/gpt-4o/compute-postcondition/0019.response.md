Output State: **`n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i+1, s_(i+1), d_(i+1)` are all positive integers. After executing the code, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `bus_routes`. The `wait_time` variable is assigned the value of `s_i - t`.**
