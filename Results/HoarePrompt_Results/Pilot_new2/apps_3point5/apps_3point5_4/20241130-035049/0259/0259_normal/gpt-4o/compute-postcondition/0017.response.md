According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `n` and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i, s_i, d_i` are positive integers. To execute one more time, the loop needs to check the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i` to determine the `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` for the next iteration.

1. Since the loop is iterating over `i`, for the next iteration, `i` should be updated to the next positive integer value.
2. Depending on the conditions of `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`, the `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` may need to be updated accordingly.

State: **`n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i+1, s_(i+1), d_(i+1)` are all positive integers**.
