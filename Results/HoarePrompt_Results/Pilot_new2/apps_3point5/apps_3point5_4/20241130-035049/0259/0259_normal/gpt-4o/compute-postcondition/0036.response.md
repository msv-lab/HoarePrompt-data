Postcondition: ***All variables `n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i+2, s_(i+2), d_(i+2)` are positive integers. If the wait time is less than the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 2`. `s_i` is assigned the value of `s_i` of the `i-th` bus route, and `d_i` is assigned the value of `d_i` of the `i-th` bus route. If `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i < t`, and the condition `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0` is true, then `wait_time` is now 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. If `wait_time < min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`***
