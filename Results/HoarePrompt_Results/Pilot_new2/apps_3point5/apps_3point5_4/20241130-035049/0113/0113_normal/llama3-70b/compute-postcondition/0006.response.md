According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the remainder of `n` divided by `x` is not equal to 0. Since `n` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the next iteration will occur when the new value of `n` satisfies the condition. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be such that `n % x` is not equal to 0.
State: **`n` must be such that `n % x` is not equal to 0**
