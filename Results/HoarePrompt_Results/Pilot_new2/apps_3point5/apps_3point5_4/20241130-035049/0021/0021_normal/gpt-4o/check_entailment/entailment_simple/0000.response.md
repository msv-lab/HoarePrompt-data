Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and then calculates the distances between these elements and the ends of the array. It then determines the maximum distance possible and prints it, which is exactly what the problem description requires. The program performs exactly one swap to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements.
