Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer n from input and a list of n integers.
- It finds the positions of the integers 1 and n in the list.
- It calculates the maximum possible distance between these positions, excluding the endpoints.
- Finally, it prints this maximum distance.

The code logic seems to align with the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after performing exactly one swap. The code considers all scenarios where the minimum and maximum elements can be optimized for distance. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, reinforcing the correctness of the code.
