Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly takes input values for n and k, then iterates from 1 to k to populate the sequence list with strictly increasing numbers that sum up to n. It then checks if the length of the sequence list is equal to k, and if so, prints the sequence. The logic of the program seems to align with the problem description, and for all provided examples, the program produces the expected output.
