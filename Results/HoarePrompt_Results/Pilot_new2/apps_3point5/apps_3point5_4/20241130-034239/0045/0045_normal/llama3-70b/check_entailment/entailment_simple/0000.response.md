Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is essential for finding the greatest common divisor of the given sequence in the problem description.

The function correctly calculates the GCD of two positive integers `n` and `k` by repeatedly applying the Euclidean algorithm until one of the numbers becomes zero. This GCD is then used to ensure that the resulting sequence of positive numbers has the maximum GCD possible.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly calculating the GCD of `n` and `k`, which is essential for creating the desired sequence of positive numbers.
