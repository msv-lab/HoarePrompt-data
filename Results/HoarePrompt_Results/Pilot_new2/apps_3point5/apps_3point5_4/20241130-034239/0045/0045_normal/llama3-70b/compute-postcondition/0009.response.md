Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two positive integers a and b, calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, and returns the GCD. The function correctly determines the GCD of the input values a and b by iteratively swapping and calculating remainders until b becomes 0. The function does not handle edge cases where either a or b is zero or negative as specified in the annotations.**
