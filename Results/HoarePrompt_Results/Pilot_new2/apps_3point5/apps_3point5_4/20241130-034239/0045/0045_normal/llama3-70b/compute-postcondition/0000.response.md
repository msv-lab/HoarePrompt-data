According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `b`. Since the loop condition is `while b`, it indicates that as long as `b` evaluates to `True`, the loop will execute. Since there is no explicit condition based on `n` and `k`, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10**
