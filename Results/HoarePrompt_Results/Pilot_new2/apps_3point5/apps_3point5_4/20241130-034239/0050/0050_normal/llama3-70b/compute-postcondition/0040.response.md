Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `shares` > 0, `r` is updated to its previous value plus the product of `shares` and `b[i]` where `i` is `n`+1. All other variables remain unchanged except `i` which becomes `n`+2, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is <= 0, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to n+1, and `shares` is set to 0, and we break out of the innermost loop or if statement.***
