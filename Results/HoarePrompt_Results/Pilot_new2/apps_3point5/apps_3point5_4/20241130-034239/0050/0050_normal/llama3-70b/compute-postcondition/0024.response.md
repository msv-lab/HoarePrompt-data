According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the variables `n`, `r`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are given. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop, `i` is equal to n-1. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted such that `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged, and `i` is set to n-1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are unchanged, `i` is equal to n-1**
