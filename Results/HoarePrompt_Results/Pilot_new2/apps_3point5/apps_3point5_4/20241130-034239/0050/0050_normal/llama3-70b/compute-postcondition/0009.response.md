Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m`, `r` is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i], `s_i`, `b_i` are unchanged, `s` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is updated to the floor division of the sum of shares and r divided by s[i], `i` is 0. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], then the current state of the program is such that `r` is greater than or equal to s[i].**
