According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and become less than `m`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `r` is updated to its previous value plus the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to n, `shares` is set to 0**.
