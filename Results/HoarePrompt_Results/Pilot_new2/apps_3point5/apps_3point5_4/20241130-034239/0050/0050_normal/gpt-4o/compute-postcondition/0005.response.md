Postcondition: ***n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000. n, m, r are assigned values based on the input split by space, and s is a list of integers created by mapping the input split by space to integers. b is a list of integers created by mapping the input split by space to integers. min_buy_price is the minimum value in the list s. max_sell_price is the maximum value in the list b. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the current value of max_sell_price is less than or equal to min_buy_price.***
