Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is updated accordingly, `r` is either the remainder of `r` divided by the element at index `i` in the sorted list `s` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, or `r` is updated based on the conditions above. `s_i`, `b_i` remain unchanged, `s` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is updated, `i` is 2 if the loop continues, and we either continue the loop or break out of the most internal loop or if statement based on the conditions.***
