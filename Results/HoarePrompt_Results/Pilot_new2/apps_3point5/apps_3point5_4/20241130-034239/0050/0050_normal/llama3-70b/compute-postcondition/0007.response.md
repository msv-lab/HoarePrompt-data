Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m`, `r`, `s_i`, `b_i` are unchanged, `s` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], then the current state of the program is such that `r` is greater than or equal to s[i].***
