Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the number of bourles the person holds. It then reads the prices for buying and selling shares. The code correctly calculates the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price. It checks if the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, and if so, it prints the initial value of bourles. Otherwise, it calculates the total bourles by determining the maximum number of shares that can be bought at the minimum price, the remaining bourles after purchasing those shares, and then adding the profit from selling those shares at the maximum price. The logic of the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that the code gives the correct output.
