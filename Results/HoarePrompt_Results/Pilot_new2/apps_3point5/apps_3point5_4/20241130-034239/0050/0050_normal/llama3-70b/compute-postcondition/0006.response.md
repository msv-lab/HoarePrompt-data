According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, shares is 0 which does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m`, `r`, `s_i`, `b_i` are unchanged, `s` is sorted list of integers in ascending order, `b` is sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0**
