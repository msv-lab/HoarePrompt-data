Postcondition: ***n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000. s and b are lists of integers created by mapping the input split by space to integers. min_buy_price is the minimum value in list s. max_sell_price is the maximum value in list b. If max_sell_price <= min_buy_price, r is printed. Otherwise, total_bourles is the product of max_shares and max_sell_price added to remaining_bourles.***
