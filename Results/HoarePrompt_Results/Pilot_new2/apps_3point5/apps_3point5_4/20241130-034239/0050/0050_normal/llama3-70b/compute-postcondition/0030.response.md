Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If shares > 0, `r` is updated to its previous value plus the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to n-1, and `shares` is set to 0. If shares <= 0, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
