Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It considers all the opportunities to buy shares in the morning, sorts them in ascending order, and iterates through them to buy as many shares as possible. Then it sorts the opportunities to sell shares in descending order and iterates through them to sell all the shares bought in the morning. The logic of buying and selling shares based on the prices and the number of shares available is implemented correctly. The final output is the maximum number of bourles the user can hold after the evening, which is the expected result according to the problem description.
