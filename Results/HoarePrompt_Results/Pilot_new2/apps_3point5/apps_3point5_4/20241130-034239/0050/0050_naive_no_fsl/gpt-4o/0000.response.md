Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of ways to buy, sell, and the initial bourles, as well as the prices for buying and selling shares.
2. It calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price correctly.
3. It then checks if it is not profitable to buy and sell shares based on the prices, in which case it simply prints the initial bourles.
4. If it is profitable, the program calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining bourles after buying these shares, and then calculates the total bourles after selling all bought shares at the maximum sell price.
5. Finally, it prints the total bourles correctly, which represents the maximum bourles that can be held after the evening. 

The program covers all possible scenarios as per the problem description and provides the correct output for each case, making it correct.
