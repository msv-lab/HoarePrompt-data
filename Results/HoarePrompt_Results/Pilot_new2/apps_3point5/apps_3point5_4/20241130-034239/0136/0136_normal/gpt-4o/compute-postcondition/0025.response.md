Postcondition: ***'a', 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is either less than the length of 'b' or greater than or equal to it. If the length of 'a' is less than the length of 'b', no change occurs in 'a' and 'b'. If the length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b', and 'a' is less than 'b', no change occurs in 'a' and 'b'. If 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b', 'a' and 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False and 'a' is not greater than 'b'.***
