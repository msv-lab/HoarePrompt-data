Postcondition: ***a, b are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0' (string representation of zero), then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. Otherwise, no change in the values of 'a' and 'b' occurs. `a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0' (string representation of zero), then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. Otherwise, no change in the values of 'a' and 'b' occurs. The current value of 'a' has a length less than the length of 'b'.***
