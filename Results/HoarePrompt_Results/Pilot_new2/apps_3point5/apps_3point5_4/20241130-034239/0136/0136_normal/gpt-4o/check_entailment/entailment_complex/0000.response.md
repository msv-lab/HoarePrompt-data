Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads two non-negative integers, removes leading zeros, and compares the values of a and b as described in the problem description. The program outputs the correct symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison of a and b. The annotations also explain the flow and logic of the program, which align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
