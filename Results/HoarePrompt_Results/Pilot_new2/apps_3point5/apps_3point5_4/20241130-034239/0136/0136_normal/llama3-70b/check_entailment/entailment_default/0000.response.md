Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, each containing no more than 10^6 digits, and compares their values after removing leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is not equal to `b` and not less than `b`, it prints '>'. The code handles the cases where inputs have leading zeros or differ in length, as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code functionality, reinforcing the correctness of the program.
