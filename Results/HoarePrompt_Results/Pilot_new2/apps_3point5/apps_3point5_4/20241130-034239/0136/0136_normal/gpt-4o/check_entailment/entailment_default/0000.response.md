Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` from input and removes leading zeros from both `a` and `b`. If `a` is '0', it is converted to the integer 0. If `b` is '0', it is also converted to the integer 0. Then it compares the values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. The code correctly handles the comparison logic as described in the problem statement. The code seems to cover all potential cases as per the problem description and all the provided examples.
