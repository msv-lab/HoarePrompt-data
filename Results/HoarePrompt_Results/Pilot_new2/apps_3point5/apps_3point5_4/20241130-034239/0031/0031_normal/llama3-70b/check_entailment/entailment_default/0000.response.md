Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly takes input for `n` and `k`.
- The `func_1` function calculates the probability of at least two out of `k` people having the same birthday in a year with `2^n` days.
- It calculates the numerator and denominator according to the given formula.
- Then, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator and updates them accordingly.
- Finally, it returns the remainders of numerator and denominator divided by (10^6 + 3).
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code follows the problem description.
- The code is able to handle edge cases such as when there are only 2 days in Udayland and 3 people, and the probability is guaranteed to be 1.

Overall, the code is correct as it meets the problem description and handles the given scenarios appropriately.
