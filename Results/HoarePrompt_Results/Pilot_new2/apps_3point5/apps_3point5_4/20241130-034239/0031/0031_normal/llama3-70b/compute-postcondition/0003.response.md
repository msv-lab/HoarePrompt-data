According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total_days is equal to 2 raised to the power of n does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, total_days is 2 raised to the power of n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
