Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of two functions that work together to calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland. The `func_2` function takes the input parameters `n` and `k` and calculates the probability based on the given conditions. It correctly handles the cases where `k` exceeds the number of days in the year, as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor needed in the probability calculation.

The code considers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, such as the number of days in Udayland (`total_days`), the probability calculations, and printing the irreducible fraction modulo 10^6 + 3. Additionally, the code annotations provide insights into the program's logic and the state of the program at different stages.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases appropriately, making the correctness **True**.
