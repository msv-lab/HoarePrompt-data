Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It calculates the probability using the formula for permutations and combinations. Additionally, it reduces the fraction to its irreducible form by finding the greatest common divisor of A and B. The code handles the edge case where k is greater than 2^n and outputs 1 1 in such cases as mentioned in the problem description. The modulo operation is also correctly applied to handle large numbers. Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
