Correctness: **True**

The program takes two integers x and y as input, where x is the initial side length and y is the desired side length of the equilateral triangle. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x based on the given formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2).

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required by subtracting the desired side length from the initial side length, dividing by 2, and then adding the remaining side if the subtraction is not divisible by 2. This approach ensures that Memory can change the side lengths in such a way that they remain integers and the triangle remains non-degenerate. The program covers all potential cases and outputs the correct result.
