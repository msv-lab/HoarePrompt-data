ou have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the while loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. 
In the information given, the output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 
The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the while loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times:  n must initially be greater than 0, `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` must have been greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` must have been  had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and fac will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 then the loop wont execute and fac will remain 1, which is indeed the factorial of 0 , and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `fac` is the factorial of the original value of `n`, 'n' is 0.
Output State: **n` is 0, `fac` is the factorial of the original value of 'n' **

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students', inital value of students must have been greater than 0
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students', initial value of students must have been greater than 1
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students', initial value of students must have been greater than 2

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in the end students will be 0. if students is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **'students' is 0, if students was initially greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of students, if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**
Your Task:

Initial State: n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty. d_queue contains the indices of employees who voted 'D' in the order they appear in the string, r_queue contains the indices of employees who voted 'R' in the order they appear in the string.
Code of the loop:
```
while d_queue and r_queue:
    d_index = d_queue.pop(0)
    r_index = r_queue.pop(0)
    if d_index < r_index:
        d_queue.append(d_index + n)
    else:
        r_queue.append(r_index + n)

```

The output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *n is a positive integer, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty. In the if part, d_queue has one more element than before, r_queue has the same number of elements as before, d_index is the value that was removed from the front of d_queue, r_index is the value that was removed from the front of r_queue, and d_index is less than r_index. The newly added element in d_queue is equal to the previous d_index plus n. In the else part, d_queue has one less element than before, r_queue has one more element than before, and the new element in r_queue is equal to the previous r_index plus n.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is a positive integer, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty, d_queue has the required number of elements, r_queue has the required number of elements, d_index is equal to the value popped from d_queue, r_index is adjusted (either popped from the beginning of r_queue or r_index + n depending on the condition), and both d_queue and r_queue have been updated accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. d_index has been appended to d_queue after adding n to it if the condition is true in the if part, otherwise r_queue contains the appended value of (r_index + n) in the else part.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is a positive integer, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty, d_queue has one less element, r_queue has the required number of elements, d_index is equal to the value popped from the beginning of d_queue, r_index is adjusted (popped from the beginning of r_queue), and both d_queue and r_queue have been updated accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. If d_index < r_index, d_queue has a new element which is equal to d_index + n. If d_index >= r_index, r_queue is appended with (r_index + n).

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state, after all the iterations of the loop have executed. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
If the state of some variables is dependant on earlier or the oginal value of some variable, make sure to seprate the original value from the current value.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
