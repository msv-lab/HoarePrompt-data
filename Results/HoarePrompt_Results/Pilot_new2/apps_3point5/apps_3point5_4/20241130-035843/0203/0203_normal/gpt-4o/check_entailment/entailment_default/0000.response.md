Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the described voting procedure where employees take turns making statements and denying others from voting. It keeps track of two queues, one for each fraction, and continuously compares the indices of the employees to determine who gets to vote next. The code correctly handles the scenario where an employee skips their turn if they have been denied from voting. The final decision is made based on which queue still has employees in it.

The output hints also align with the code, as it pairs employees who voted 'D' and 'R' based on their indices and prints 'D' if there are more employees who voted 'D', otherwise it prints 'R'.

Overall, the code seems to be following the problem description as well as the output hints, making it correct.
