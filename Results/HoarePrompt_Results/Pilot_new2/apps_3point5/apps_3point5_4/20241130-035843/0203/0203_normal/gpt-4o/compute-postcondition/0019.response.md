According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both d_queue and r_queue are not empty. Right before the loop, n is a positive integer, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty, d_queue contains the indices of employees who voted 'D' in the order they appear in the string, r_queue contains the indices of employees who voted 'R' in the order they appear in the string. To execute the loop one more time, both d_queue and r_queue need to have at least one element.
State: **n is a positive integer, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty, d_queue and r_queue must both have at least one element**
