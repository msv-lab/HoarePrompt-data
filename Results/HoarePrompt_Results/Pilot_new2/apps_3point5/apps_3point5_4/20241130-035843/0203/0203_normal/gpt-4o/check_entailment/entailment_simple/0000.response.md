Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It organizes the employees who belong to the 'D' fraction and 'R' fraction into separate queues based on their indices in the input string. It then simulates the voting process by pairing up employees from both factions, ensuring that the employee with the smaller index always votes first. This process continues until one of the queues is empty, indicating that all members of that faction have been paired up. The program then prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty, otherwise it prints 'R', as stated in the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases and correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on the described voting procedure.
