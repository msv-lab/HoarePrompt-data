Output State: **n is a positive integer, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty. After all iterations of the loop, either d_queue or r_queue will be empty. If d_queue is empty, then all employees who voted 'D' have been paired with employees who voted 'R' based on their indices. If r_queue is empty, then all employees who voted 'R' have been paired with employees who voted 'D' based on their indices. The specific pairing order may vary depending on the values of d_index and r_index in each iteration of the loop.**
