Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the described problem. It takes the input of the number of employees and their fractions, calculates the count of 'D' and 'R' fractions, and then determines the majority political party based on the counts. It prints 'D' if the count of 'D' fractions is greater than the count of 'R' fractions, and 'R' otherwise. This aligns with the problem description of predicting the outcome of the vote based on the fractions of employees. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
