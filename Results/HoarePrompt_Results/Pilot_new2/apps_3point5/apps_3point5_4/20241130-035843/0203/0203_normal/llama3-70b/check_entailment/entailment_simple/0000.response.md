Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the count of 'D' fractions and 'R' fractions in the input string. It then compares the counts and prints 'D' if there are more 'D' fractions or 'R' if there are more 'R' fractions. This aligns with the problem description where the outcome of the vote is based on the majority of fractions in the input string. 

The program follows the problem description as it determines the outcome of the vote based on the fractions of employees and prints the correct result ('D' or 'R').
