Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem. It maintains two queues, one for depublicans and one for remocrats, and then proceeds to simulate the voting process. It ensures that each employee who has made a statement and the ones denied the right to vote are skipped, and continues the process until only one faction is left. The program correctly outputs 'D' if depublicans win and 'R' if remocrats win as per the problem description. The code covers all potential cases and works as expected.
