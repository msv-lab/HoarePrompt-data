According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `m` is 2. Since the loop starts from 1, for it to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, the condition `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2` suggests that the values at index `i` and `i - 1` are not in the required relationship, so this condition needs to be satisfied for the loop to continue.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is 2. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1] * 2**.
