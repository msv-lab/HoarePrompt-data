Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i` are all positive integers. `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains a[0], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, the loop executes when n is greater than or equal to 2, and `can_form` is True. If a[i] - x is in assigned, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
