According to the code, the loop can execute if there is at least one element in the list `assigned`. However, since `can_form` is False, the loop will not execute. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute, `can_form` needs to be True. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains a[0], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, the loop executes when n is greater than or equal to 2, `can_form` is True**
