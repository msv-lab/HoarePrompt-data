Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the list of distinct positive integers in ascending order, and for each element, it checks if there exists a pair of elements in the `assigned` set such that their difference is equal to the current element. If not, it increments the count of `m` and adds the current element to the `assigned` set.

The program ensures that the sequence of operations can be performed with the minimum number of variables by checking if the current element can be formed by the sum of two previously assigned values in the `assigned` set. If such a sum exists, the `can_form` flag is set to True, and the loop continues to the next element.

The program correctly calculates and returns the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem statement.
