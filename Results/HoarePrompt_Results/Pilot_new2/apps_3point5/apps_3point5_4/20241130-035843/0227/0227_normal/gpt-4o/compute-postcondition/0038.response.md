Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is True, and there is at least one more element in `assigned` to iterate over. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
