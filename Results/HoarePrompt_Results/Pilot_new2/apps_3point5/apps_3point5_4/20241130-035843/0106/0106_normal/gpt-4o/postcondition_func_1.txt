Functionality: The `get_location` function accepts an integer parameter `apartment`, representing the apartment number where Edward or Natasha live. It then calculates and returns the `block` and `floor` where the apartment is located. The `block` is determined by the expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and the `floor` is calculated using the expression `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The function successfully calculates the location based on the input apartment number. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
