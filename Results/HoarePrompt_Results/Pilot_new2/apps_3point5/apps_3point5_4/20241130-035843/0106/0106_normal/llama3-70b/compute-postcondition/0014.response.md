Functionality: The function `func` reads input integers `n, m, k, a, b` satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. It then calculates `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time`, and `min_floor_time` based on these inputs. `min_block_time` is determined by the difference in blocks multiplied by 15. `min_floor_time` is set based on the difference in floors multiplied by 5 with an additional fixed time. The function then prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. The function does not explicitly return any value.
