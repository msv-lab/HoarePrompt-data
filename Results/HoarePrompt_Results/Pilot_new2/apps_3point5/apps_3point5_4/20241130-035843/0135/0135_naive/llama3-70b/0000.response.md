Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes input of two integers n and k, then iterates through the range from 1 to k+1 to calculate the remainder of n divided by i. It uses a set 'seen' to keep track of the remainders seen so far. If a remainder is already in the set, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set. If the loop completes without printing "No", it prints "Yes" indicating that all remainders are distinct.

The program follows the problem description for every potential case, ensuring that all remainders are distinct as required.
