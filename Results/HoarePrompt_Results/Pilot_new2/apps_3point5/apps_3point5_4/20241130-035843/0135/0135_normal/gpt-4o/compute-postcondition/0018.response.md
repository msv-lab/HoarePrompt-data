Postcondition: ***`n >= k+1`, `k < n+1`, `seen_remainders` is a set containing values of `n modulo i` where `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders` and `remainder` is the value of `n modulo i`, `i` is `k+1`, `remainder` is the value of `n modulo (k+1)`. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the program returns the string 'No'.***
