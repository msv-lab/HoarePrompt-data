Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `n` and `k` are assigned values obtained from splitting the input string into integers, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 1. If the current value of `remainder` is in `seen`, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
