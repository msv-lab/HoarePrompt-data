The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The program has multiple return points:

- Case 1: The program returns 'No'
- Case 2: The program returns the string 'No'
- Case 3: The program returns the string 'No'
- Case 4: The program returns the string 'No'
- Case 5: The program returns 'Yes'

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on certain conditions, return either 'No' or 'Yes' at different points in the program.
