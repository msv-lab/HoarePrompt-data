Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `T`, then for `T` test cases, it reads integers `n` and `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calculates the balance of 0s and 1s in the string, compares it to `x`, and based on the conditions prints different values. If the balance equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`, if a certain condition involving `x` and the balance holds, it prints -1, otherwise it performs a calculation and prints the result. The function does not explicitly return a value but prints the results based on the conditions. Missing functionality or edge cases are not explicitly handled based on the provided code. **
