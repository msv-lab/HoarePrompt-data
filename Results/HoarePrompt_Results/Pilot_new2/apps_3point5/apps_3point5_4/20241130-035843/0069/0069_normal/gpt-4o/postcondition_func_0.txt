The function `func_1` reads input data, processes it according to defined constraints, and calculates results based on the given conditions. It handles cases where the balance of '0's and '1's in the binary string `s` is equal to 0 and when it's not. For the former case, it checks if a specific value `x` exists in the cumulative sum list `prefix_balances` and appends -1 if it does, or 0 if it doesn't. In the latter case, it iterates through `prefix_balances` to count the occurrences where a certain condition is met and stores the counts in the `results` list. Finally, it prints each result. The function does not explicitly return any value but performs the specified calculations and operations based on the input parameters.
