Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input data for multiple test cases, calculates the balance of the given string, generates a list of prefix balances, and then calculates the number of prefixes with the desired balance. The logic seems to be correctly handling all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The program outputs the correct number of prefixes or -1 if there are an infinite number of prefixes. The implementation follows the problem description accurately.
