Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer increased by the number of times the loop executed, `x` is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length n, `input` is assigned the value sys.stdin.read, `T` is an integer value at index 0 of the list data and must be greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is the result of counting '0's minus '1's in binary string s, `prefix_balances` is a list of (n+1) elements where `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` for each index `i`. Additionally, the balance is not equal to 0.***
