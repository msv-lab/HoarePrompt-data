Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, `prefix_balances` list have at least two elements, `results`, `T`, and `count` remain the same. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
