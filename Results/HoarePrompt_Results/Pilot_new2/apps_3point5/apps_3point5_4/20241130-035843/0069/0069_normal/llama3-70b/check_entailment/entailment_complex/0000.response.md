Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values for `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` as described, calculates the balance of 0s and 1s in the string `s`, and then based on the conditions outlined in the problem description, it prints the correct values: `n + 1`, -1, or a calculated value. The program handles the cases where the number of prefixes with the desired balance might be infinite by checking the condition `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` and printing -1 accordingly. Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately for all potential test cases.
