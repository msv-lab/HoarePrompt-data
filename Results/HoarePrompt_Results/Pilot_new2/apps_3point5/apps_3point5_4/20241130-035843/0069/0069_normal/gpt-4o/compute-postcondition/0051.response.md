According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is assigned the integer value at index 8 of the list `data`
- `s` is assigned the integer value at index 10 of the list `data`
- `balance` is equal to the result of subtracting the count of '1's in `s` from the count of '0's in `s`
- `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`
- `i` is 2
- `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`
After running the code, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to be equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the `prefix_balances` list needs to be updated accordingly:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at index 8 of the list `data`, `s` is assigned the integer value at index 10 of the list `data`, `balance` is equal to the result of subtracting the count of '1's in `s` from the count of '0's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to be equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1**
