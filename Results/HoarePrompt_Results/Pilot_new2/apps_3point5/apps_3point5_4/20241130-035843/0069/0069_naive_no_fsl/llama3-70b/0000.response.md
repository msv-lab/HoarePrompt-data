Correctness: False

The provided code is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case where the balance is not equal to x and the difference between x and the balance is not divisible by the difference between the counts of 0s and 1s. In such cases, the code incorrectly calculates the number of prefixes.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 0
11
```
The expected output should be 1, but the code will output -1. This is because the code doesn't consider cases where the balance is not equal to x and the difference is not divisible by the counts of 0s and 1s.
