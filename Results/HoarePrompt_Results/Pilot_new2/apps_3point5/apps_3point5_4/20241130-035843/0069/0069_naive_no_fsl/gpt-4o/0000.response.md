Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where there are an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance. The program incorrectly assumes that if the desired balance exists in the prefix balances list, then there are an infinite number of prefixes with that balance, which is not always true.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 0
0
```
The correct output should be -1 since there are an infinite number of prefixes with balance 0. However, the program will output 1, as it checks if the desired balance exists in the prefix balances list and then assumes there are an infinite number of prefixes.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness False.
