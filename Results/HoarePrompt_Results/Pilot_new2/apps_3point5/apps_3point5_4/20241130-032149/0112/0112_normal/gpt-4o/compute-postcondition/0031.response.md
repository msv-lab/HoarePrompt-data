Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and digit is in cube_faces[i], then `used_cubes[i]` becomes True, `found` becomes True, `i` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
