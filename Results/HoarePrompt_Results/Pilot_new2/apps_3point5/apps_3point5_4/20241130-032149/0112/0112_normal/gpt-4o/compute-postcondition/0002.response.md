According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the digits list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, num is a list of n tuples, digits is a list of strings, and used_cubes is a list of n False values. To execute the loop, the digits list must have at least 1 element, and the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:
State: **num is a list of n tuples, digits is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, used_cubes is a list of n False values**
