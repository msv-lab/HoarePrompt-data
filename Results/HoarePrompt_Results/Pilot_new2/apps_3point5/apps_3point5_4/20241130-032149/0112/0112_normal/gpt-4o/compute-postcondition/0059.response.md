According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`**
