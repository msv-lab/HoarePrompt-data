According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num is a list of n tuples, digits is a list of strings with at least 1 element, used_cubes is a list of n boolean values with the ith element set to True if (not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]), found is True, i is 0, n is greater than 0. Since the loop is at the start, for the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **num is a list of n tuples, digits is a list of strings with at least 1 element, used_cubes is a list of n boolean values with the ith element set to True if (not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]), found is True, i is 1, n must be greater than 1**
