According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1 if the loop continues. If not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i], the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes[i+1]` is True, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `n`**
