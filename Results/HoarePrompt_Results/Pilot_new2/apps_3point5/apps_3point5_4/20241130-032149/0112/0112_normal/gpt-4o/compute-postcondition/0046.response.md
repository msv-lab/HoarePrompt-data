According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` has at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `found` is True if at least one element in `used_cubes` is True. Since the condition (not found) is False, at least one element in `used_cubes` is True. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the `digits` list.
State: **`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `found` is True if at least one element in `used_cubes` is True.**
