Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1 if the loop continues. If not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i], the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
