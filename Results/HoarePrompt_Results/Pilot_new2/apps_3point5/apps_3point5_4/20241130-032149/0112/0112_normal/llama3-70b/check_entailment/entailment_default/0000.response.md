Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program fails to account for the restrictions that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the code may provide incorrect results in scenarios where digits 6 and 9 are present on the cubes, as they cannot be interchanged. The output hints do not provide examples of this specific edge case, but based on the problem description, the code does not handle this restriction properly.
