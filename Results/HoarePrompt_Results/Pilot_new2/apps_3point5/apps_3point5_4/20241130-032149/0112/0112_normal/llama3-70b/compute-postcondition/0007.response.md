According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 3 inner lists (cubes), the loop will execute again for the third time. 

At the end of the last iteration, n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers entered by the user for the respective cube and must have at least 2 cubes. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must have at least 3 inner lists, and the loop will then iterate over the next cube in the list.

State: **n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers entered by the user for the respective cube and must have at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube and additional string representations of digits in the cube added using the `update` method**.
