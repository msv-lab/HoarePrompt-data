According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If there are more digits left in the list, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `found` is True, and the condition (not found) is false.

To execute the loop one more time, the next digit in the `digits` list needs to be considered. So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: *num is a list of n tuples, digits is a list of strings with at least 1 element (excluding the processed digit), used_cubes is a list of n boolean values, found is True, and the condition (not found) is false*
