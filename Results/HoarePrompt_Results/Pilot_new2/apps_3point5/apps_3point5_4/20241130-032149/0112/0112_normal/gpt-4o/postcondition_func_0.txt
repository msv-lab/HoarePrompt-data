The function func_1 accepts an integer n and a list of n lists, where each inner list represents the digits on the faces of the cubes. It iterates over the cubes to create a list of sets representing the unique digits on each cube face. Then, it incrementally increases the value of x until it satisfies the condition can_form_number(x + n), and finally returns the value of x.
