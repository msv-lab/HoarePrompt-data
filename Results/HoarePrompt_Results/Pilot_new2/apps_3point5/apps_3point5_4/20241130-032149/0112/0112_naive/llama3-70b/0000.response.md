Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, extracts all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, and then constructs the maximum number that Masha can make. This logic covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description. Additionally, the program does not violate any of the constraints specified in the problem.
