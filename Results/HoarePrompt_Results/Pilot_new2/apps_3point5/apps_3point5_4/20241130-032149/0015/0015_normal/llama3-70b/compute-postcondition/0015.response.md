Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers a, b, and c as input. If c is 0, it checks if a is equal to b and prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If c is not 0, it verifies if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly and operates solely based on user input.**
