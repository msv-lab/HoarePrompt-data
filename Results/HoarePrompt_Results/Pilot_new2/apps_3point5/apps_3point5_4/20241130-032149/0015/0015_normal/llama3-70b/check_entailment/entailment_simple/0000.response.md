Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether Vasya's favorite number appears in the sequence based on the input values of a, b, and c. It follows the conditions specified in the problem description and outputs "YES" if b appears in the sequence, and "NO" otherwise. The program handles both cases where c is 0 and when c is not 0, ensuring that the correct output is provided for each scenario. Hence, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
