Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the favorite number b appears in the sequence based on the values of a, b, and c provided as input. It handles the special cases where b is equal to a, c is equal to 0, or if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the result is non-negative. Therefore, the program is correct.
