Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the minimum of the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears available. It then calculates the total number of fruits by considering the ratio provided in the problem description. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and correctly outputs the maximum total number of fruits that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the code's functionality. Since there are no cases identified where the code fails to meet the requirements, the correctness is determined to be True.
