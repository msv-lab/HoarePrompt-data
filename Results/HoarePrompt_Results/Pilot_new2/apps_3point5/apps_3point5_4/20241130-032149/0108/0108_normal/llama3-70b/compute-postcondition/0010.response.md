According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` had its first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the alphabet, and `res` was updated with the value of `char` concatenated. This means for the loop to execute one more time, the new `s` must still contain `char`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the alphabet, `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, `res` is updated with the value of `char` concatenated**
