The function func_1 accepts three integers l, r, and k within the specified constraints and returns the result of a calculation involving these parameters and an empty dictionary dp. The calculation is (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD where count is a function that is expected to be defined elsewhere. However, the actual functionality heavily relies on the implementation of the count function, which is not provided in this code snippet. Therefore, the function func_1 acts as a coordinator for invoking the count function with the given parameters and computing the result based on the returned values.
