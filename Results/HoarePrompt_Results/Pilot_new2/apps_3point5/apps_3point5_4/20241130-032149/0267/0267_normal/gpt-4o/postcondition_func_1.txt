The function func_2 accepts three integer parameters l, r, and k satisfying specific constraints (1 <= l <= r < 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10). It iterates through the range [l, r] and for each number checks if func_1(num, k) returns true. If true, it updates total_sum by adding the number and taking the modulo MOD. The function then returns the updated total_sum, which represents the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] for which func_1(num, k) is true. If no numbers satisfy the condition, total_sum remains 0 after the calculation.
