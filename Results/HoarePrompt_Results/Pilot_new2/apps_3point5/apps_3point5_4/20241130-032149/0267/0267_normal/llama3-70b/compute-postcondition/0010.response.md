According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is greater than or equal to 10^k is already satisfied. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are k is greater than 1, i is 1, and dp[n, k] is 9.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10, k is greater than 1, i is 1, dp[n, k] = 9**
