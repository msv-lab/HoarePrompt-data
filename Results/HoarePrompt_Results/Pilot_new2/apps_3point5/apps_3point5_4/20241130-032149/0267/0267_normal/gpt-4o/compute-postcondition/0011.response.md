Output State: **After the loop executes, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of all numbers `num` in the range [l, r] such that `func_1(num, k)` is true, calculated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD` for each valid `num`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false for all numbers in the range [l, r], `total_sum` remains 0.**
