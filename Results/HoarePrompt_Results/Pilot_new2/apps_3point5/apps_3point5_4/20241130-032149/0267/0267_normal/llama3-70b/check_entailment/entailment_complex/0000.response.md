Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code implements two functions: func_1 and count, as described in the problem statement.
2. The func_1 function correctly calculates the sum of numbers from l to r such that each number contains at most k different digits, and returns the result modulo 998244353.
3. The count function correctly calculates the count of numbers within a range that contain at most k different digits, considering different scenarios based on the value of k.
4. The code structure aligns with the problem description and handles the constraints provided.
5. The code annotations provide additional insights into the state of the program before and after function calls, which align with the logic of the functions.

Overall, based on the code and annotations, the program appears to correctly solve the given problem and follows the problem description for every potential case.
