According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is less than k. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1 and k is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, i should be incremented by 1 to become 2.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10, k is greater than 1, i is 2, dp[n, k] = 9 and dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 * 10**
