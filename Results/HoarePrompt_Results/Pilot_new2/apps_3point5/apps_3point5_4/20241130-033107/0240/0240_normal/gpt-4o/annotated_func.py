#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing a very large integer, sub is a substring of s containing consecutive digits of s.**
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: s_counter[char] is decremented by the value of sub_counter[char] for each unique char in sub_counter until it reaches 0 for all chars present in sub_counter.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the smallest number from the list possible_numbers based on their integer values
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters, a string `s` representing a very large integer and a substring `sub` of `s`. It then calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters in `sub`. It generates possible numbers using the remaining characters and `sub`, then returns the smallest number from the list `possible_numbers` based on their integer values. If the code executes correctly, it accurately finds the smallest number from the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a string representing a very large integer, sub is a substring of num_str. Both num_str and sub can contain leading zeroes.**
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if substring 'sub' is found in 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to 'n_len', otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `is_valid_number` accepts two string parameters `num_str` and `sub`. It returns True if the substring `sub` is found in the string `num_str` and the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`. If these conditions are not met, it returns False. The function does not account for cases where `n_len` is not defined, leading to potential errors. Additionally, it does not handle cases where `sub` is an empty string, which could potentially affect the validity check.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a string of digits with length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a string representing a substring of chars.**
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: chars is a string of digits with length at least 1, sub is a valid substring of chars, perm is the last permutation of chars, candidate is the string formed by joining the last permutation of chars, candidate is a valid number with the sub string, and all valid numbers with the substring have been yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. Here, `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`. The function generates all possible permutations of the characters in `chars` and yields those permutations that form valid numbers with the substring `sub`. The function does not have a specified return value. However, there seems to be a missing essential function `is_valid_number` that is mentioned in the annotation but not included in the code, which is crucial for the functionality described.
