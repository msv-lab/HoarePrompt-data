Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `t`, where `s` is a string representing a very large integer, and `t` is a substring of `s`. The function iterates through each character in `s`, checks if it exists in the set of characters in `t`, and appends it to a new string `n`. Finally, it concatenates `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of the resulting string. The function essentially filters out characters from `s` that are also in `t` and returns the integer formed by those characters plus the initial `t`.**
