Functionality: The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. Here, `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`. The function generates all possible permutations of the characters in `chars` and yields those permutations that form valid numbers with the substring `sub`. The function does not have a specified return value. However, there seems to be a missing essential function `is_valid_number` that is mentioned in the annotation but not included in the code, which is crucial for the functionality described.
