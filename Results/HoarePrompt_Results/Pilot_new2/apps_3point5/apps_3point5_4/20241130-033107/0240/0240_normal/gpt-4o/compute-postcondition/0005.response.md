According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more permutations of the `chars` string to generate. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining the first permutation of `chars`. The current value of the `candidate` is a valid number with the sub string. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated. This means adjusting the state to have the next permutation after the current one.

State: **chars is a string of digits with length at least 1, sub is a valid substring of chars, perm is the next permutation of chars, candidate is the string formed by joining the next permutation of chars. The current value of the candidate is a valid number with the sub string.**
