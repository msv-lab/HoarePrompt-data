Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description and logic provided. It calculates the nearest integer that ends with zero based on the input number n. The program covers all scenarios where the number n needs to be rounded to the nearest integer ending with zero. Additionally, the logic implemented handles both cases where the remainder is less than or equal to 5 and where it is greater than 5. All the given examples in the problem description are correctly handled by this program.
