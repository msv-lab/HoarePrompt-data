Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input and performs the following operations:
- If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints the value of `n`.
- If `n` is not divisible by 10, it checks if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5. If true, it prints `n - n % 10`. If false, it prints `n + (10 - n % 10)`.
The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
