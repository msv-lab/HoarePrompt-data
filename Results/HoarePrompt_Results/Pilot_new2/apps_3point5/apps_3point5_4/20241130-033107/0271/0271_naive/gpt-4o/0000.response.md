Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly rounds the input number n to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It determines the remainder of n when divided by 10 and then checks if the remainder is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it subtracts the remainder from n, otherwise it adds the difference of 10 and the remainder to n. This logic ensures the correct rounding behavior as described in the problem statement. The program accounts for all possible cases where the rounding may lead to a number ending in 0.
