Correctness: True

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description for all possible cases. It handles the scenarios where the result is certain (either "+", "-", or "0") and also correctly identifies when the result is uncertain by printing "?". The program follows the logic outlined in the problem description, making the correct comparisons and printing the appropriate results. Therefore, the program is correct.
