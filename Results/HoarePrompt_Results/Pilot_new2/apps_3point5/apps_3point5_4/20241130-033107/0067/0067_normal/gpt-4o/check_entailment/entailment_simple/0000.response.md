Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the input values of x, y, and z. Then, it checks if there are more upvotes or downvotes based on these calculated values. If there are more upvotes, it prints "+", if there are more downvotes, it prints "-", and if the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal or within the range of uncertainty, it prints "?". This aligns perfectly with the requirements stated in the problem description.
