Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. The current value of `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`. The code snippet simply prints the '+' symbol and does not affect the values of any variables.**
