Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length between 1 and 1000 consisting of only English letters. It iterates through the string and checks if the characters at index i and n - 1 - i are equal. If all characters satisfy this condition, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. **

Potential Missing Functionality: The current code does not handle the case when the input string is empty. If the input string is empty, the function should return True since there are no characters to compare.
