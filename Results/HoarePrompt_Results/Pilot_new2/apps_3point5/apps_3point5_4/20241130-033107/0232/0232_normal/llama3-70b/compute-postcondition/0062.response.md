Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean, `i`, `j`, `n` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1. All counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts` in a sorted manner. `color_counts` remain the same. `color` is the color at index 1 in the list `colors`. If the condition is satisfied, `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
