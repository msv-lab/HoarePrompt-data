Postcondition: ***Each color in current_counts must have a value greater than or equal to the corresponding desired count except for at least one color, `left` is incremented by the total number of iterations, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is increased by the total number of iterations plus 1, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by the total number of iterations plus 1, `right` is incremented by 1. Additionally, there exists at least one color where current_counts[color] is not equal to desired_counts[color]***
