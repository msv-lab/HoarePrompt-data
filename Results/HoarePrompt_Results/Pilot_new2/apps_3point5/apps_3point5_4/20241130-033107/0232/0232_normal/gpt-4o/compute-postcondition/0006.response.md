Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `m` (inclusive) and values as `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0 except `colors[right]` which is incremented by 1, `left` is 0, `right` will iterate from 0 to n-1, and at least one color in `current_counts` must be less than the corresponding `desired_counts`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, all colors in `current_counts` are equal to their corresponding values in `desired_counts`.***
