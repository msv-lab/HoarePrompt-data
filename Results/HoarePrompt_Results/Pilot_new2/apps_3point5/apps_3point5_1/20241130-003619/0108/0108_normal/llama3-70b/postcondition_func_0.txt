The function `func` reads a string input, iterates over the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', replaces each character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet, and constructs a result string containing all characters from the alphabet that were present in the input string before replacements. If the length of the result string is 26, it prints the result string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters.
