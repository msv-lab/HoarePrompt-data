Postcondition: ***`s` is assigned the input string provided by the user, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` may be equal to or greater than the length of string `s`, `j` may be equal to or greater than 26, both `i` and `j` have been incremented accordingly based on the condition `s[i] == target[j]`. If `j` equals `target_len`, the program has processed all elements of `target`. Otherwise, `j` does not equal `target_len` and no variables are affected by the code snippet `print(-1)`.***
