Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string `s` and iterates through it, trying to match the characters with the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If it successfully matches all characters in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' with `s`, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Otherwise, it prints -1. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, as it aims to find a subsequence of the input string that contains the English alphabet in order. The program covers all possible cases and correctly handles them.
