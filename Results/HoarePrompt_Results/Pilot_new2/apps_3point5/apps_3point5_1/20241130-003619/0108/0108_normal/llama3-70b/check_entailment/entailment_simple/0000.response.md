Correctness: **True**

The program takes an input string `s` and iterates through the lowercase alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character is present in the input string `s`. If it is, the program replaces that character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. The program then checks if the length of the resulting string `res` is 26 (the length of the alphabet). If it is, it prints out `res`, which will contain the English alphabet as a subsequence. If not, it prints -1.

The program correctly follows the problem description as it tries to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence by iteratively replacing characters in the input string `s` with the next character in the alphabet. It correctly handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence by checking the length of the resulting string `res`.
