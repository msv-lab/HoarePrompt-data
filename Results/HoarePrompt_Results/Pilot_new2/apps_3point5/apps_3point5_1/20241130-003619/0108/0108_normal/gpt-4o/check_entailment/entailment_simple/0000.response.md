Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string `s` from the user input and tries to match it with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It iterates through the string `s` and whenever it finds a character that matches the character at the current position in the target string, it increments the index `j`. At the end, if `j` reaches the length of the target string, it means that `s` contains the English alphabet as a subsequence and the target string is printed. Otherwise, if `j` does not reach the length of the target string, it means it is not possible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence and -1 is printed.

The program correctly follows the problem description as it checks for the presence of the English alphabet as a subsequence in the input string `s` and prints the target alphabet if it is possible. If it is not possible, it correctly prints -1.
