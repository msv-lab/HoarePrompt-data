Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where Masha cannot form any numbers from 1 to x using the provided cubes. The program should return 0 in such cases according to the problem description. However, the program does not check for this condition and will keep incrementing x indefinitely in the while loop.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is considered incorrect.
