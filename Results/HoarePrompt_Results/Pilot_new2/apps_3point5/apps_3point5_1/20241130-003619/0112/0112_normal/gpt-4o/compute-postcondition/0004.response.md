According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` being a positive integer and `digits` being a non-empty list ensure that the loop can execute. However, since `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to False, it needs to be adjusted so that all elements are True. Also, since `found` is False, it needs to be adjusted to True.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to True, `found` is True**
