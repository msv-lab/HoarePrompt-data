According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `n`. Before the loop starts, the given conditions indicate that the loop will execute if `n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to True, `found` is False, and there is at least one more digit left in the `digits` list. 

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to True, `found` is False, at least one more digit left in the `digits` list, `i` is within the range of `n`**
