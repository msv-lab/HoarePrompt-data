The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user. The input consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 3, followed by n lines, each containing 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes. Each digit on the face of the cube is an integer from 0 to 9.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read input from the user, which includes the number of cubes and the digits on the faces of the cubes.
