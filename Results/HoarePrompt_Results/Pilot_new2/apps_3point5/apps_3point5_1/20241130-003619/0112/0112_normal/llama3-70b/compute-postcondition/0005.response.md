According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 2 cubes, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, cubes has at least 1 list of integers, cube is the first list in cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must have at least 2 lists of integers, cube is the second list in cubes, and digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the second cube.
State: **Output State: n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes must have at least 2 lists of integers, cube is the second list in cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the second cube**
