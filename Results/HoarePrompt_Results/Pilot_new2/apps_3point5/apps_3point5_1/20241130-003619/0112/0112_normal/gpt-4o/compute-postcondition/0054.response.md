According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing at least one more digit, all elements in `used_cubes` are set to True, `found` is True, there are more digits left in the `digits` list, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited after the if condition is satisfied. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing at least one more digit, all elements in `used_cubes` are set to True, `found` is True, there are more digits left in the `digits` list, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited after the if condition is satisfied.**
