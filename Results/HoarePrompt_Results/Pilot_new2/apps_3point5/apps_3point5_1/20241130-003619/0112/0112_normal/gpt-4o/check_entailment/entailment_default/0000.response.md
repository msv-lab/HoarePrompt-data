Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully adhere to the problem description. The `can_form_number` function checks if each digit of a given number can be formed using the faces of the cubes, but it does not consider the constraint that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the code may incorrectly allow forming numbers that violate this constraint. In the provided test cases, the code might incorrectly allow forming numbers such as 69 or 96, which should not be allowed according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
