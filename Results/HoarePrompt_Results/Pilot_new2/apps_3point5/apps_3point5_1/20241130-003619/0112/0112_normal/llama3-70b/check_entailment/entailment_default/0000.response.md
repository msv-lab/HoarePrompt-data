Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input as described in the problem statement.
- It creates a set of unique digits excluding '0' from the cubes, which aligns with the requirement of using each digit only once.
- The code then finds the maximum number that can be formed by arranging these digits in descending order, which meets the condition of obtaining the largest natural x that Masha can make.
- Finally, it prints the calculated maximum number, satisfying the output requirement. 

Overall, the code appears to follow the problem description and output specifications for all potential cases.
