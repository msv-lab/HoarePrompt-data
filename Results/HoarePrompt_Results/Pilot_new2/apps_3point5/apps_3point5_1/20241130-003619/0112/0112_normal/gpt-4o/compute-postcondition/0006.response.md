Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to True, `found` is True. If the condition (not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]) is True, then the current value of used_cubes[i] is False and digit is in cube_faces[i. Now, used_cubes[i] is set to True.**
