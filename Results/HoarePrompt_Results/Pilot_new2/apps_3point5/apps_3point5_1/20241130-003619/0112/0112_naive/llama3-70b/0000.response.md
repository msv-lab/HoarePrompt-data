Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the input, extracts all unique digits from the cubes excluding '0', removes leading '0' if present, sorts the digits in reverse order, and then constructs the maximum number that Masha can make. The logic used in the program covers all potential cases and correctly outputs the maximum number x that Masha can make. The program handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description.
