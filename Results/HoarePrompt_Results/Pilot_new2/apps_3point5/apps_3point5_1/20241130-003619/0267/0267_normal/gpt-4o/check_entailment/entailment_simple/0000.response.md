Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of two functions. 

Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly checks if the number of unique digits in a given integer `n` is less than or equal to `k`.

Function 2 (`func_2`) correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` where each number contains at most `k` different digits. It iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r`, checks if each number satisfies the condition using `func_1`, and updates the total sum accordingly. The sum is computed modulo `MOD` as required.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description accurately and produces the correct output for all possible cases.
