#State of the program right berfore the function call: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the number of unique digits in the integer 'n' is less than or equal to the integer 'k', otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. It returns True if the number of unique digits in the integer 'n' is less than or equal to the integer 'k'. If the number of unique digits in 'n' exceeds 'k', the function returns False. The code accurately checks if the number of unique digits in 'n' is less than or equal to 'k' and returns True in that case. However, it lacks handling cases where 'n' has more unique digits than 'k', which should result in returning False.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l`, `r`, and `k` remain the same. `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD` for every `num` from `l` to `r` where `func_1(num, k)` is true.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns the updated value of `total_sum` after adding all numbers from `l` to `r` where `func_1(num, k)` is true and taking the sum modulo `MOD`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= 10. It iterates over numbers from `l` to `r`, calculates the total sum of numbers that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` is true, and returns the updated value of `total_sum` after taking the sum modulo `MOD`.
