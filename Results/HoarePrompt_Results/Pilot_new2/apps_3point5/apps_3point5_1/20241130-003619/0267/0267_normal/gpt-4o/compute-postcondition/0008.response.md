According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l`, `r`, and `k` remain the same. `total_sum` is updated according to the value returned by `func_1(num + 1, k) modulo MOD. So, for the next iteration, `num` needs to be incremented by 1. If `func_1(num, k)` is true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. 
State: **`l`, `r`, `k` remain the same. `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `num` is incremented by 1.**
