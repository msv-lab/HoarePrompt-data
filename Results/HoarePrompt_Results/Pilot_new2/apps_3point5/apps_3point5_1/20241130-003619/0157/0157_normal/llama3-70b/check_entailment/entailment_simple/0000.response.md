Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It calculates the minimum number of fruits based on the ratio given in the problem description and then computes the total number of fruits by multiplying the minimum number of each type of fruit with their respective ratios. This ensures that the fruits are used in the correct ratio of 1:2:4 as required by the recipe. The program handles all possible cases and outputs the correct result.
