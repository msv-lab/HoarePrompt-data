Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be obtained based on the constraints (minimum of the three ratios), and then calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum number of lemons with their respective values (1, 2, and 4). Finally, it prints the total number of fruits obtained.

The code aligns perfectly with the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote as whole fruits. The output hints also confirm that the code is in line with the problem description.
