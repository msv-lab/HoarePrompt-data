Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the given ratios in the problem description. It ensures that for each lemon, there are exactly 2 apples and 4 pears in the compote. The calculation of `max_lemons` ensures that the minimum of available lemons, apples divided by 2, and pears divided by 4 is taken into consideration. This guarantees that the fruits are used in the correct ratio.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases.
