Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If the favorite number b is equal to the first element a, then the program correctly outputs "YES".
2. If the difference between a and b is 0, and the sequence does not change (c=0), then the program correctly outputs "NO".
3. If the difference between a and b is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, then the program correctly outputs "YES".
4. If none of the above conditions are met, the program correctly outputs "NO" as per the problem description. 

Therefore, the program covers all potential cases and works correctly for each one.
