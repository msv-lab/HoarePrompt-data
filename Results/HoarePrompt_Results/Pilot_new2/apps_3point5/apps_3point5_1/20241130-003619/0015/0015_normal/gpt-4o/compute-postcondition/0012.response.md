Postcondition: ***a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The variables a and b are assigned values based on the input split operation, and b is not equal to a. If c == 0, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0), the program prints 'YES'. If either ((b - a) % c != 0) or ((b - a) / c < 0), the program prints 'NO'.***
