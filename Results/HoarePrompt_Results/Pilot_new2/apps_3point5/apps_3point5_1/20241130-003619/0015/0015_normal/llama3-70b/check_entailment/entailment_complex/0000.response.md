Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input and checks if `b` appears in the sequence as described in the problem. The program considers both cases where `c` is 0 and when `c` is not 0, ensuring that it covers all possible scenarios. The conditions specified in the if-else blocks align with the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
