Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. 
- If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, 'NO' otherwise. This covers the case where the difference between elements will always be 0.
- If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative, then prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This accounts for cases where there is a difference between elements and ensures a proper check based on the difference value. 

Given the code and the problem description, it appears that the code handles all potential cases as described. The output hints also agree with the code by providing clarity on the conditions to print 'YES' or 'NO'. Therefore, the code is correct.
