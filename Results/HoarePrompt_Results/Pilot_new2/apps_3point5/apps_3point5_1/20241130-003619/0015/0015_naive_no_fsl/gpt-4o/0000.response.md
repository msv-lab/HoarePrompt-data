Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. If the favorite number b is equal to the first element a, then the program correctly outputs "YES".
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0, then the program correctly outputs "NO" as there would be no sequence generated.
3. If the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the result is greater than or equal to 0, then the program correctly outputs "YES" as b appears in the sequence generated. Otherwise, it outputs "NO".
4. The program covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
