Functionality: The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` where 0 <= n <= 99 and returns the word representation of `n` based on the following conditions:
- If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the word representation from the 'ones' list.
- If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding value from the 'teens' list.
- If n is divisible by 10, it returns the string representation of the tens place digit from the 'tens' list.
- For all other cases, it concatenates the word representing the tens place of n and the word representing the ones place of n separated by a hyphen.
