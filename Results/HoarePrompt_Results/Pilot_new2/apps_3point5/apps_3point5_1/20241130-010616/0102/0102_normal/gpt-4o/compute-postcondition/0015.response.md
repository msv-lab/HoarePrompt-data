The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99. After executing the function body, the program returns different outputs based on the value of `n`:

Case 1: If `n` is between 0 and 9, the program returns the word representation of the integer `n` from the list 'ones'.

Case 2: If `n` is between 11 and 19, the program returns the corresponding value from the 'teens' list based on the index calculated as n - 10.

Case 3: If `n` is divisible by 10, the program returns the string representation of the tens place digit of the number `n` using the 'tens' list provided in the initial state.

Case 4: For all other cases, the program returns the concatenation of the word representing the tens place of integer `n` and the word representing the ones place of integer `n` separated by a hyphen.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `n` between 0 and 99 and return the appropriate word representation based on the specified cases.
