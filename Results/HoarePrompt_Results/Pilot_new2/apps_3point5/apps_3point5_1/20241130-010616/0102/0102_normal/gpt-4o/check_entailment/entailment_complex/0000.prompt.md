You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

You can find all you need to know about English numerals in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99.**
def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven',
    'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy',
    'eighty', 'ninety']
    if (0 <= n <= 9) :
        return ones[n]
        #The program returns the word representation of the integer n between 0 and 9 from the list 'ones'
    else :
        if (11 <= n <= 19) :
            return teens[n - 10]
            #The program returns the corresponding value from the 'teens' list based on the index calculated as n - 10, where n is currently between 11 and 19
        else :
            if (10 <= n <= 99) :
                if (n % 10 == 0) :
                    return tens[n // 10]
                    #The program returns the string representation of the tens place digit of the number 'n' which is divisible by 10. The string representation is based on the 'tens' list provided in the initial state.
                else :
                    return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
                    #The program returns the concatenation of the word representing the tens place of integer n and the word representing the ones place of integer n separated by a hyphen.
            #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']; teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']; tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']. n is not between 11 and 19. n is not between 10 and 99, or n is not an integer between 10 and 99.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']; teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']; tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']. n is not between 11 and 19. n is not between 10 and 99, or n is not an integer between 10 and 99.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']; teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']; tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']. n is not between 11 and 19. n is not between 10 and 99, or n is not an integer between 10 and 99.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` where 0 <= n <= 99 and returns the word representation of `n` based on the following conditions:
- If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the word representation from the 'ones' list.
- If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding value from the 'teens' list.
- If n is divisible by 10, it returns the string representation of the tens place digit from the 'tens' list.
- For all other cases, it concatenates the word representing the tens place of n and the word representing the ones place of n separated by a hyphen.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
