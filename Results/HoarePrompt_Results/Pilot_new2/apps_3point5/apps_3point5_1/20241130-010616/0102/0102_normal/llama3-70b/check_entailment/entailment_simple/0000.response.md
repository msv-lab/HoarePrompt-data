Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly converts an integer score into its English word representation, as specified in the problem description. The program handles cases where the score is between 0 and 9, between 10 and 19, and between 20 and 99, covering all possible inputs. The output of the program is always a string consisting only of English lowercase letters and hyphens, as required by the problem description. The program logic aligns with the problem description, making it correct.
