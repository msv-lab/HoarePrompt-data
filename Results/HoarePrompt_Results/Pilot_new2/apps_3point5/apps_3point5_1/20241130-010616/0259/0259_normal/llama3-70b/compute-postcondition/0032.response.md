The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it processes the bus routes data internally. 

The function `func` calculates the next `n` bus arrival times for each bus route based on the given time `t`, first bus arrival time `si`, and interval between buses `di`. The function returns a list of the next `n` bus arrival times for each bus route. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the next `n` bus arrival times for each bus route based on the provided data.
