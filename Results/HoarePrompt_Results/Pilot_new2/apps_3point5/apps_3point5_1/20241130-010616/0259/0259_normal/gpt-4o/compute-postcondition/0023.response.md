Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples, `min_wait_time` is calculated, `chosen_route` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple at index `i`, `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index `i`, `wait_time` is either `s_i - t` if `s_i >= t`, or 0 if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, otherwise it is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
