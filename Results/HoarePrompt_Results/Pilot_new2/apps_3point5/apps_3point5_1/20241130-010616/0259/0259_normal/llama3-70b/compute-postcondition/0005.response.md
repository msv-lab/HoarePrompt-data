According to the code, the loop will execute 'n' times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)` that was appended, `_` is 0, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from the input split. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` should be increased by 1, as the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)` that was appended, `_` is 1, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from the input split**
