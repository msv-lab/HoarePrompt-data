Output State: **The program returns the route with the minimum wait time, which is stored in chosen_route. The chosen_route consists of two elements: s_i and d_i, where s_i is the starting point and d_i is the destination point of the route. The wait_time is either equal to min_wait_time or the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions.**
