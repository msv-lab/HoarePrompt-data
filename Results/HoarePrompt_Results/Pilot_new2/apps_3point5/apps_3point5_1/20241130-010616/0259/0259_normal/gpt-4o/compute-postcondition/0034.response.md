Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is equal to 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple at index 2, `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index 2. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
