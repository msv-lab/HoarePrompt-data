Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in the 'buses' list. It then iterates through each bus route to calculate the time until the next bus arrives for each route. It keeps track of the minimum time and the corresponding bus route index. Finally, it prints the bus route that Serval will use based on the calculated minimum time. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description, and for all possible cases provided in the examples, the program outputs the correct bus route. Therefore, the program is correct.
