Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements in the array by finding their positions and taking the maximum distance possible by swapping either the minimum or maximum element with another element in the array.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and always outputs the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after exactly one swap. Hence, the program is correct.
