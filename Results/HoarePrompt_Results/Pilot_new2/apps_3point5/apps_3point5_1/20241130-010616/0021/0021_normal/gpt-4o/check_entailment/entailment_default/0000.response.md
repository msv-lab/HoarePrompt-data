Correctness: **False**.

The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the calculation of the distances `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. These distances are not correctly calculated based on the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4 5 1 3 2
```
In this case, the correct output should be 3. However, the code does not handle this case correctly, as it calculates the distances incorrectly.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
