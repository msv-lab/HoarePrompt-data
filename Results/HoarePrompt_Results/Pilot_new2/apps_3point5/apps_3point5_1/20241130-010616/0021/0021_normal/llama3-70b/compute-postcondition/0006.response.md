Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values after splitting them; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of value 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of value `n` in list `a`; `max_dist` is equal to the maximum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1 and `n` - 2; `min_dist` is equal to the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1 and `n` - 2. The code calculates the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n` - 1 - `min_dist` and prints it.**
