Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array, calculating the distances between these elements and the ends of the array, then finding the maximum distance possible by considering all four possibilities. The program then outputs this maximum distance which matches the requirements of the problem description. The program handles all cases where the minimum and maximum elements can be swapped to maximize their distance.
