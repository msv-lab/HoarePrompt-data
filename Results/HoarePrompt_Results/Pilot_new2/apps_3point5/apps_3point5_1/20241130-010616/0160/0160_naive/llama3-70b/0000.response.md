Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list A, then iterates through all possible divisors of the gcd to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Additionally, the program handles all constraints specified in the problem description. Since the program follows the requirements for every potential case based on the problem description and the provided constraints, it is considered correct.
