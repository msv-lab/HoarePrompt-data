Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in A and finds all the divisors of the sum of all elements in A. Then, it iterates through the divisors in descending order and checks if the divisor satisfies the condition for every element in A. If the condition is met, it prints the divisor and breaks out of the loop. This logic covers all possible cases and correctly follows the problem description.
