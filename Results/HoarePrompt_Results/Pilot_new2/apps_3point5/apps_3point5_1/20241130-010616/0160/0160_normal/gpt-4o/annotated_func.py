    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function func_1 accepts a list of integers 'lst' and calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list. The function iterates through the elements in the list using a for loop, updating the gcd_result by finding the greatest common divisor with each element. The final result returned is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list. The function assumes that the list 'lst' has at least 2 elements.

    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of divisors of x in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x`, calculates all the divisors of `x`, and returns a sorted list of these divisors in reverse order. The function correctly identifies divisors of `x` using a set to avoid duplicates. However, the code does not handle the case where x is less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior. It is expected that `x` should be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 for the function to work effectively.
