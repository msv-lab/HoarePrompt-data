According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `math.sqrt(x)` is calculated correctly. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the `divisors` list should contain the updated values after adding x divided by 2 and the new value of `i` added to it.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is an integer such that x >= 1, i is 3, math.sqrt(x) is calculated correctly, divisors contains the updated values after adding x divided by 2 and x divided by 2, and divisors has the new value of 2 added to it.**
