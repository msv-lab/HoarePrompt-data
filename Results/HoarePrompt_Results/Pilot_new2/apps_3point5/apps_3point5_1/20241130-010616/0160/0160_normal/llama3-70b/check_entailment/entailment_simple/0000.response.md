Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It does so by first calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A using the math.gcd function. Then, it iterates through all the divisors of the gcd (up to the square root of gcd) and updates the max_divisor to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd//i, where i is a divisor of gcd.

This approach ensures that the program finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations, as required by the problem description.
