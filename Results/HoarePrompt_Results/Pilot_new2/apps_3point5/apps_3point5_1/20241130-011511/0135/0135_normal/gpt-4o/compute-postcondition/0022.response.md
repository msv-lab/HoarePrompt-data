The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program returns different strings based on the values of `n` and `k`:

- Case 1: If the conditions for Case 1 are met, the program returns the string 'No'.
- Case 2: If the conditions for Case 2 are met, the program returns the string 'No'.
- Case 3: If the conditions for Case 3 are met, the program returns the string 'No'.
- Case 4: If the conditions for Case 4 are met, the program returns the string 'No'.
- Case 5: If the conditions for Case 5 are met, the program returns the string 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and return different strings based on the values of `n` and `k` according to the specified cases.
