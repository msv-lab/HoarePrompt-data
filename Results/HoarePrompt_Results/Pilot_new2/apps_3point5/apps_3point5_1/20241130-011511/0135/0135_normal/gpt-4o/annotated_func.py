def func_1(n, k):
    if (k >= n) :
        return 'No'

        remainder = n % i
        
        if remainder in seen_remainders:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, seen_remainders is a set containing the remainder of n divided by i for all i between 1 and k (inclusive). If there is a duplicate remainder in seen_remainders, the program returns 'No'.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters n and k, both between 1 and 10^18. It then iterates through the range from 1 to k (inclusive) and checks for duplicate remainders when n is divided by i. If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No'. If no duplicate remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes'. This means that the function aims to determine whether there are any duplicate remainders when dividing n by numbers from 1 to k.
