Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers n and k as input.
- It then iterates through the range from 1 to k (inclusive) and calculates the remainder when n is divided by i.
- If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No'.
- If no duplicate remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes'.
- This logic aligns with the problem description as it checks for distinct remainders when dividing n by numbers from 1 to k.
- The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implemented based on the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
