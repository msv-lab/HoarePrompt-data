Correctness: **True**

The annotated program is correct as it follows the problem description exactly. It reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, stores these remainders in a set `seen`, and checks if any remainder is repeated. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The program handles all cases where `n` and `k` are in the range 1 <= n, k <= 10^18 and ensures that the remainders are distinct. The program does exactly what the problem description asks for in all cases.
