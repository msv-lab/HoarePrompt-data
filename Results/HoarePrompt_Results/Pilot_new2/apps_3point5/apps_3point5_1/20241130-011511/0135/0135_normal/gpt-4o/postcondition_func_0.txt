The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters n and k, both between 1 and 10^18. It then iterates through the range from 1 to k (inclusive) and checks for duplicate remainders when n is divided by i. If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No'. If no duplicate remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes'. This means that the function aims to determine whether there are any duplicate remainders when dividing n by numbers from 1 to k.
