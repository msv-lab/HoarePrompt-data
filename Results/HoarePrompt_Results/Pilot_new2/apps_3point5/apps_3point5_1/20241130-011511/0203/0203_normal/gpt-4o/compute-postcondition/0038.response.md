Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` contains the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `r_queue` has been modified by removing the element at index 0. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has a new element appended which is `d_index` + `n`, and `r_index` is equal to the value that was removed from the beginning of `r_queue`. If `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, then `r_queue` has been modified by removing the element at index 0 and then appending `r_index + n`, `d_queue` has a new element appended which is `d_index` + `n`, and `r_index` is equal to the value that was removed from the beginning of `r_queue`.***
