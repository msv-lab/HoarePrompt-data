According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `fractions` list. So the `fractions` list must not be empty for the loop to execute. Additionally, since `depublicans` and `remocrats` are initialized to 0, they do not impact whether the loop can execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; fractions is a non-empty list of characters 'D' or 'R'; depublicans is 0; remocrats is 0**
