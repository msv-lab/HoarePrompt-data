Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000. `votes` contains the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. The current value of `r_index` is the first element from `r_queue` that has been removed. The current value of `d_index` is `r_index + n`, where the previous value of `d_index` was the first element removed from `d_queue` and was less than the previous value of `r_index`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_index` is updated to `r_index + n`. Otherwise, if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, a new element is appended to `r_queue` which is the previous value of `r_index` plus `n`.***
