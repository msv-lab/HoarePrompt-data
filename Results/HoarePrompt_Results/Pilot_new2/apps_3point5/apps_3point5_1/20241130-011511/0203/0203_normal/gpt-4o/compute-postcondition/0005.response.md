Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000; votes contains the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace and must have at least 1 element; d_queue is an empty list; r_queue is an empty list; `i` is 0, `v` is the first element in the votes list. After entering the if condition where v is equal to 'D', the program's state is such that the current value of v is 'D' and all other variables remain the same as before entering the if condition.***
