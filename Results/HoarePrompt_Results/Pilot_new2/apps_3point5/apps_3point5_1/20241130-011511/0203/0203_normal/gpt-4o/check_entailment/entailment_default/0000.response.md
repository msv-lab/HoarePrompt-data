Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to correctly follow the problem description. It categorizes the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters into separate queues, then processes these queues based on their indices, moving the indices by `n` positions if the 'D' index is smaller than the 'R' index. Finally, it prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty, otherwise 'R'. The code handles the scenario as described in the problem where employees make statements one by one and deny other employees the right to vote. It effectively simulates the voting process and determines the outcome based on the last remaining employee eligible to vote. The output hints also align with this logic, reaffirming the correctness of the code. Additionally, based on the provided examples and the problem description, the code appears to produce the correct outcomes.
