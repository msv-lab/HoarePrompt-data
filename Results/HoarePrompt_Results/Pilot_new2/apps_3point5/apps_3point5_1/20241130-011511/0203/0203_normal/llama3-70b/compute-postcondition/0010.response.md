According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If there are more fractions in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer representing the number of employees and fractions is a non-empty list. If the last fraction processed was 'D', depublicans is 1 and remocrats is 0. If not, depublicans is 0 and remocrats is 1. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more fraction in the list.
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; fractions is a non-empty list of characters 'D' or 'R'; if the last fraction processed was 'D', depublicans is 1 and remocrats is 0. If not, depublicans is 0 and remocrats is 1.**
