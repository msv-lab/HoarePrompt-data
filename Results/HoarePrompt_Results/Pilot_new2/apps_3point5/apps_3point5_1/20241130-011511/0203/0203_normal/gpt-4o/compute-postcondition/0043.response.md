Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains the same as the original input integer between 1 and 200,000. `votes` still contains the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. `d_queue` is empty. `r_queue` contains the elements that were not processed. `d_index` and `r_index` remain the same as the last values assigned to them during the loop execution. The if condition `(d_queue)` evaluates to false. The program prints 'R'.**
