Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for n, m, k, a, and b.
- It calculates the floor and block numbers for apartment a and apartment b accurately.
- It determines the minimum time required to move between blocks and floors based on the calculated values.
- Finally, it prints the sum of the minimum block time and the minimum floor time, which corresponds to the time taken for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
- The logic in the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that Edward can reach Natasha's apartment in the minimum time possible.
