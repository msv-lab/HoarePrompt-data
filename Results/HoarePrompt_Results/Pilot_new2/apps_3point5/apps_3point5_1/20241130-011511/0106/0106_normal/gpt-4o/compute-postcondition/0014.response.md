Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts 5 integer parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the total time taken to move from `block_a` to `block_b` considering floor transitions and walking time. The direct_walk_time is calculated as the absolute value of `(block_a - block_b) modulo n` multiplied by 15. The reverse_walk_time is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) modulo n` multiplied by 15. The min_walk_time is the minimum value between direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time. The time_to_target_floor is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The total_time is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.**
