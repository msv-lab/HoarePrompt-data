Output State: **direct_walk_time is equal to the absolute value of (block_a - block_b) modulo n multiplied by 15, block_a, block_b, floor_a, floor_b are assigned the return values of the functions get_location(a) and get_location(b). If floor_a is equal to 1, time_to_exit is set to 0. If floor_a is not equal to 1, time_to_exit is equal to 10 + (floor_a - 1), reverse_walk_time is equal to (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) modulo n multiplied by 15. min_walk_time is assigned the minimum value between direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time. time_to_target_floor is assigned the value of (floor_b - 1) * 5, total_time is equal to time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor**
