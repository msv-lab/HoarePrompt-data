Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the logic of the program implementation. The program counts the number of prefixes with a specific balance value by iterating through the prefix balances and checking if a certain condition is met. However, this logic is flawed and does not cover all possible cases.

For example, consider the test case:
```
Input
1
4 2
1010
Output
0
```
For this test case, the correct output should be 1, as the prefix "1010" has a balance of 2. However, the program incorrectly outputs 0.

Therefore, based on this example, we can conclude that the program is incorrect in handling all potential cases and does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
