Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the total number of times the if condition was true during the loop execution, if `x` is in `prefix_balances` then `results` contains the value -1, if `x` is not in `prefix_balances` then a new element 0 is added to `results`, after entering the if condition, `x` and `b` satisfy the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0). `results` has been appended with the value of `count`**
