The function `func` reads an input `T`, then iterates `T` times. Within each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, calculates the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, and determines the balance. Depending on the balance compared to `x`, different values are printed. If balance equals `x`, `n` is incremented by 1. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the function calculates and prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.
