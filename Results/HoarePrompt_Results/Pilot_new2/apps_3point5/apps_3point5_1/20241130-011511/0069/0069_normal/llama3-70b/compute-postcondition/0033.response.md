Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, n is updated, x is assigned the second input value, s contains the input value, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1 with adjustments. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, the code prints -1. Otherwise, the code prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1).***
