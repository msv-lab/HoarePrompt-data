Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, the length and balance for each test case, and the binary string. It then calculates the balance of the string and compares it to the desired balance. Based on the conditions specified in the problem description, it correctly determines the number of prefixes with the desired balance or prints -1 if there is an infinite number of such prefixes. The program follows the problem description for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
