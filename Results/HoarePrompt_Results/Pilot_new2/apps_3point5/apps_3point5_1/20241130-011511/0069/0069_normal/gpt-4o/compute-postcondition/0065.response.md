Postcondition: ***`balance` is calculated based on the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 with at least one element, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `s`, the balance is not equal to 0, `count` equals 1. After entering the if condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0), the current value of x and b satisfy the condition, and the balance is divisible by (x - b) with a non-negative quotient.***
