According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1 where the ith element is the sum of the ith element in the previous list and 1 if s[i - 1] is equal to '0' and -1 otherwise, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `n` should be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1 where the ith element is the sum of the ith element in the previous list and 1 if s[i - 1] is equal to '0' and -1 otherwise, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
