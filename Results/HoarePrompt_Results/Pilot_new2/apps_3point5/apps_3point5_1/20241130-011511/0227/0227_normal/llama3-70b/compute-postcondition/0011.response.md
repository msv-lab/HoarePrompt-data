According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 2. Since the loop starts from 1, the next value of `i` will be 3 for the loop to execute again. The condition given is that the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to twice the value of `a[i - 1]`. This means that at the next iteration, the value of `a[3]` should not be equal to twice the value of `a[2]`.
State: **n is at least 2, i is 3, a_k (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) are distinct positive integers, a is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, m is 3. The current value of a[3] is not equal to twice the value of a[2]**
