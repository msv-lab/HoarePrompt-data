    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `assigned` is a set containing all elements of list `a`, `m` is equal to the number of elements in list `a`, `i` is the index of the last element in list `a`, `can_form` is False, `x` is the last element in the set `assigned`
    return m
    #The program returns the number of elements in list 'a', which is represented by variable 'm'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a. It sorts the list a in ascending order, iterates through the elements of a to determine if each element can be formed by adding two elements from the list, and counts the number of elements that cannot be formed in such a way. It then returns the count of elements that cannot be formed, represented by variable m.
