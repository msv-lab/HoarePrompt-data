According to the code, the loop can execute if the set `assigned` is not empty. Since `assigned` now contains the last element of list `a`, it implies that `assigned` is not empty. Therefore, to make the loop execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `assigned` is a set containing all elements of list `a` and is not empty, `m` is 2, `i` is the index of the last element in list `a` plus 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is the last element in the set `assigned`**
