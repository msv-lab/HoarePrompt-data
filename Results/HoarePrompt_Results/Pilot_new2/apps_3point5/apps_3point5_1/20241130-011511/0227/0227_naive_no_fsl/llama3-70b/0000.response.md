Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence of numbers in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted list, checking if each number is double the previous number. If it's not, it increments the count of variables needed. Finally, it outputs the count of variables if it's less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it outputs -1.

This logic covers all potential cases as it ensures that each number in the sequence can be obtained by either assigning the value itself or summing up two other variable values. The program also handles the limit of 23 variables as specified in the problem description.
