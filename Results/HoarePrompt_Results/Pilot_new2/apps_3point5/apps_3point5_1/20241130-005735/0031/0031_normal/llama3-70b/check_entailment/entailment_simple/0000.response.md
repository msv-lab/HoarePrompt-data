Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It computes the probability as an irreducible fraction A/B, where A and B are coprime integers, and then returns the remainders of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3.

The program uses a loop to calculate the numerator and denominator of the probability fraction based on the number of people being interviewed and the total number of days in the year. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator and reduces the fraction to its irreducible form.

Finally, it returns the remainders of the reduced numerator and denominator modulo 10^6 + 3 as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and should work correctly for all valid inputs.
