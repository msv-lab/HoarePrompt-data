The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` within the specified constraints. If `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, the function prints '1 1' and exits. Otherwise, it calculates values for `numerator`, `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `p_shared`, `A`, `B`, and `g` based on the input parameters. The calculated values are then used to print `(A % MOD, B % MOD)`. In case the conditions specified in the annotations are not met, the functionality may deviate from what is described.
