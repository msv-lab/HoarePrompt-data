Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It handles edge cases and returns the GCD as required.
- The function `func_2` correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland. It correctly handles the cases where the probability is guaranteed to be 1, and it computes the irreducible fraction A/B. The output hints also align with the code implementation, and there are no cases identified where the program deviates from the problem description.
