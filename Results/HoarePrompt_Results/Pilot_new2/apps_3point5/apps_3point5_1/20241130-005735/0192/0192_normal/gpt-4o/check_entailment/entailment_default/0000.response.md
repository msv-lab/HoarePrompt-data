Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `x` and `y`, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. It then calculates the difference between x and y, and returns half of that difference rounded up. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. Additionally, looking at the provided examples, the code produces the correct output for each one of them. Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
