Correctness: **False**

The code provided only calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers `x` and `y`, but it does not actually implement the logic required to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x.

For example, if we consider the input (6, 3) as in the sample test case, the code will simply output the absolute difference between 6 and 3 which is 3. However, the correct minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length 3 from the equilateral triangle of side length 6 should be 4 as highlighted in the example.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and hence, the correctness of the code is **False**.
