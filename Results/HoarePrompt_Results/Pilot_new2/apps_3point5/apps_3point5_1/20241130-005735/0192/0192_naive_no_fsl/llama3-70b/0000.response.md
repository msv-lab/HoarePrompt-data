Correctness: False

The provided program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The program should find the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y, not just the absolute difference between x and y. 

For example, if x = 6 and y = 3, the correct minimum number of seconds required is 4 (as shown in the problem description), but the program would output 3 (|6 - 3| = 3) which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not work for all potential cases based on the problem description.
