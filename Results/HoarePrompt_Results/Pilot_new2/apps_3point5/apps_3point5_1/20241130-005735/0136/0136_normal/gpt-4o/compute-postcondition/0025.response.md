Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing the input values. `a` and `b` are strings with leading zeros removed. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is not less than the length of `b`, and `a` is not less than `b`, the program will not print anything. If `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is greater than `b`, the program will not print anything.***
