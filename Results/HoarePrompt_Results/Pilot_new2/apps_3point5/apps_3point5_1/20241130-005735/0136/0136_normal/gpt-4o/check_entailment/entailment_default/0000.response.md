Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and removes any leading zeros. 
- It then compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, it prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, it prints '>'. 
- If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, it compares the values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='.
- The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each one. 
- There are no edge cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
