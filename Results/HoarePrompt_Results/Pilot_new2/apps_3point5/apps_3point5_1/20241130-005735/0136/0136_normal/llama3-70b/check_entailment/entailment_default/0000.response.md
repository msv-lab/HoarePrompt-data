Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` with no leading zeroes. It then compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The code correctly handles the comparison of two very long integers and gives the correct output based on their values. The code also aligns with the problem description and the examples provided. The logic is simple and straightforward, making it easy to understand and verify.
