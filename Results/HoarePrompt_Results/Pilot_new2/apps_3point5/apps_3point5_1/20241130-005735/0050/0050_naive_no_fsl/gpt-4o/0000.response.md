Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price, then checks if it's profitable to buy and sell shares. If it's profitable, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining bourles, and the total bourles after selling the shares. The logic is sound and will provide the maximum profit based on the given opportunities to buy and sell shares.
