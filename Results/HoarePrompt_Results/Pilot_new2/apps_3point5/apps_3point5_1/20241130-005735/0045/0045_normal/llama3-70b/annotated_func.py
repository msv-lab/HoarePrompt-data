#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers.**
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `b` must be true or non-zero for the loop to execute, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is equal to the modulo of `n` and `k`
    return a
    #The program returns the previous value of `b`, which is equal to the modulo of `n` and `k`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, and calculates the greatest common divisor of `n` and `k` using the Euclidean algorithm. It then returns the calculated greatest common divisor.
