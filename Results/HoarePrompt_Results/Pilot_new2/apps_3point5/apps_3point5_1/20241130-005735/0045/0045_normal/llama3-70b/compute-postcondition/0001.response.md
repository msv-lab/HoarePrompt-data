Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected. The loop will continue to execute as long as `b` remains true or non-zero. 
Output State: **n and k are positive integers, `b` needs to be true or non-zero for the loop to execute, `a` and `b` have been swapped, and `a` is now equal to the modulo of its previous value and the previous value of `b`.**
