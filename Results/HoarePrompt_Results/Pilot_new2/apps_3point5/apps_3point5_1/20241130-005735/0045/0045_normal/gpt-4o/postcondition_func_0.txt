The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. It first calculates `min_sum` based on the formula k * (k + 1) // 2 and checks if `min_sum` is greater than `n`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate `d`, `remainder`, and generates a list `sequence` based on the given formula. The function then returns the list `sequence`. If the calculated `remainder` becomes 0 during the loop execution, the loop breaks. Therefore, the function either returns -1 or a list `sequence` with values calculated as `d` * (i + 1) for i in range(k).
