The function `func` takes user input as a non-negative integer `n` within the range of 0 to 10^9. It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 and based on the value of the remainder, it adjusts the result accordingly. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is computed as the difference between `n` and the remainder. If the remainder is greater than 5, the result is calculated as `n` plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. The function then prints the result.
