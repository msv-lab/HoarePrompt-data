Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly rounds the input number to the nearest integer that ends with 0, as specified in the problem description. If the input number is already divisible by 10 (ends with 0), it prints the input number itself. If the last digit of the input number is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from the input number. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the required amount to reach the next number that ends with 0. The code covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, the code is correct.
