Correctness: True

The program correctly rounds the non-negative integer n to the nearest integer that ends with 0, as required by the problem description. It calculates the remainder of n divided by 10 and then rounds n based on the value of the remainder. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from n. If the remainder is larger than 5, it rounds up by adding (10 - remainder) to n. This logic correctly implements the rounding process described in the problem description.
