Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. The list of colors of the lightsabers contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. The list of desired counts of lightsabers of each color contains m integers such that 1 ≤ ∑ ki ≤ n. colors is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input. counts is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input.**
