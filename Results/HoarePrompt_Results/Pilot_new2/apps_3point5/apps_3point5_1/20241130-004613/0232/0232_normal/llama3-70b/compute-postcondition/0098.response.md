Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `colors`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, and `j` are all incremented by 1. `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` and value `1`. `i` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, the `color` is not in `window_counts`, and `j` is less than `n`.***
