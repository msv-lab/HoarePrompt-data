Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, the program variables `n`, `m`, `colors`, `color`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `found`, `window_counts`, `i`, and `j` retain their initial conditions. Additionally, if `found` is True, then the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.***
