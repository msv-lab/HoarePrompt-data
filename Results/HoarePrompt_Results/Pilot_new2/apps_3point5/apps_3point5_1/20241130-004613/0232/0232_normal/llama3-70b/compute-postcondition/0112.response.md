Postcondition: ***After the loop finishes executing, `n`, `m`, `colors`, `color`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `j` are all incremented by 1. `window_counts` is a dictionary where the keys are the colors from the `colors` list and the values represent the frequency of each color within the window. If all the counts in `window_counts` match the target counts in `counts`, then `found` will be True. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `found` is True.***
