Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, the program output state will have `n` greater than or equal to 2, `m` as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n+1, `colors` as a list of integers with at least n+1 colors, `counts` as the list of integers, `color_counts` with updated values reflecting the number of occurrences of each color, `found` as True, `window_counts` as a dictionary where the color not in it has a count of 0, `i` less than n+1, `j` equal to `i + 1`, `color` equal to `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` updated to 0, and if color not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is now 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
