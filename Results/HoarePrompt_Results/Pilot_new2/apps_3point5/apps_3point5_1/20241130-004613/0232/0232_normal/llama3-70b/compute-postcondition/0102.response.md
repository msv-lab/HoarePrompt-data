Postcondition: ***All variables (`n`, `m`, `colors`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `j`, `window_counts`) are incremented by 1. `window_counts` remains a dictionary with key `color` and value `2`. `i` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color` is not in `window_counts`, and `j` is less than `n`. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding target counts in `counts`, then `found` is True and the inner loop or if statement is exited.***
