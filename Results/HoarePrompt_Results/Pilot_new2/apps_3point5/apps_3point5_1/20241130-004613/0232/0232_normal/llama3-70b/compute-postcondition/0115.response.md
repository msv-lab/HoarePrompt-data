Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers with at least n colors, `color` is the last color in the list, `counts` is the list of integers, `color_counts` contains the updated values with the number of occurrences of each color, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the targets in `counts`, `window_counts` contains the count of each color until index `n`. If `found` is True, then we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
