According to the code, the loop will execute as long as all colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`. Right before the loop, the conditions are already met for the loop to execute one more time. No states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: All colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`, program returns 'YES', `left` is increased by the total number of times the loop executed + 1, `right` is incremented by 1, the count of color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` is increased by 1**
