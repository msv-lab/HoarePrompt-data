Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in appropriate variables. It then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights and checks if the counts of lightsabers of each color match the desired counts. If such an interval is found, it sets the found flag to True and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints "YES" if a valid interval is found, otherwise "NO". The program covers all possible cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem description.
