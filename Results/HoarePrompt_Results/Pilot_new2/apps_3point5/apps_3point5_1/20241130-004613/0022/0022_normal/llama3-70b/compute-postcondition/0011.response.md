Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of string `s`, which is greater than or equal to 2; `is_spalindrome` is either True or False depending on the comparison of characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1`; `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
