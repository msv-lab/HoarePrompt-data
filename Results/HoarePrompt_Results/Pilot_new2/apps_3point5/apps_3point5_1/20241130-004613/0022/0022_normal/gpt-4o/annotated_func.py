#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string containing only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000.**
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the characters at positions i and n - 1 - i in string s are the same for all i from 0 to (n // 2) - 1, then the program returns True. Otherwise, the program returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True if the characters at positions i and n - 1 - i in string s are the same for all i from 0 to (n // 2) - 1, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string containing only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. The function iterates through the string to check if the characters at symmetric positions are the same. If all characters at symmetric positions match from the start to the middle of the string, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function correctly determines if the string `s` is a palindrome.
