Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of string `s` which must be greater than or equal to 2; `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, `is_spalindrome` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
