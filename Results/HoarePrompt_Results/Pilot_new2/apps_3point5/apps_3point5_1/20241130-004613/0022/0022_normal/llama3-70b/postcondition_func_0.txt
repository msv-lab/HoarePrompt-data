The function `func` reads a string `s` from the input, checks if `s` is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and then prints 'TAK' if `s` is a palindrome, and 'NIE' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters, but operates on the input string `s` of length between 1 and 1000, consisting only of English letters.
