Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- For the first example (3 7 0), if x > y + z, then it's guaranteed that the result will be '+', which is correctly handled by the program.
- For the second example (2 0 1), if x < y, the result will be '-', which is correctly handled.
- For the third example (1 1 0), if x == y and z == 0, the result will be '0', which is correctly handled.
- For the fourth example (0 0 1), there are two possibilities based on the unknown person's vote, so the program correctly outputs '?' to indicate uncertainty.
