Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description. It takes in three integers representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or are unknown. It then calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the unknown votes. Finally, it determines the result ('+', '-', or '?') based on the comparisons of the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes. The code covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming that it follows the problem description accurately.
