Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It determines the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the input values of x, y, and z. Then, it checks the conditions to determine if the result should be "+", "-", or "?". 

For all possible input cases within the given constraints (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 100), the program will output the correct result according to the problem description. It covers all scenarios where the result can be determined and where it is uncertain. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
