Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes in the string received by Kate and the substring Vasya remembers. It then iterates through the string and only keeps the characters that are present in the remembered substring. Finally, it appends the remembered substring to the filtered string and returns the smallest integer possible. The logic seems correct and based on the problem description, so the program is correct.
