Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program, along with all its functions, correctly implements the problem description. The code takes in a string representing a very large integer that has been appended with the number of digits in the integer, and a substring that Vasya remembers. It then calculates the smallest possible initial integer based on the remembered substring. The functions within the code handle the character frequency differences, generate possible numbers, and validate the numbers based on the substring. The program considers all permutations of the remaining characters after subtracting the remembered substring and yields the valid candidate numbers.

There are no cases identified in the problem description or the annotations that suggest the code does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
