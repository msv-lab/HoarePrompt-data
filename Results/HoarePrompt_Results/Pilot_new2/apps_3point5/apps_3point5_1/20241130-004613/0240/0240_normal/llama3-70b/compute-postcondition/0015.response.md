The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`, both of which are strings. After executing the function body, the program returns an integer that is obtained by concatenating all characters in string `s` that are also present in set `t_set`, followed by all elements of set `t_set`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, and return an integer that combines characters from `s` that are present in `t_set` with all elements of `t_set`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters s and t, returns an integer obtained by concatenating characters in s that are also present in set t_set, followed by all elements of set t_set.**
