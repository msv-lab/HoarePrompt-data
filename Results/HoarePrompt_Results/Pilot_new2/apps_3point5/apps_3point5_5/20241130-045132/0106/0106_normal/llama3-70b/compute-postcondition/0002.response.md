Example Answer:
`(a_floor)` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The value of `a` is obtained by mapping the input after splitting, so the value of `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `b` are not affected.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input. `a`, `b` are assigned the integer values obtained by mapping the input after splitting. `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`**
