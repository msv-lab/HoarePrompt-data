Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the problem description. It calculates the time for block transitions and floor transitions separately, considering the circular nature of the building and the different time constraints for moving between blocks and floors. It then prints the total minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. The program follows the logic defined in the problem description for all possible cases.
