Output State: **n, m, k, a, b are integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k. block_a is the block number where a is located, floor_a is the floor number where a is located, block_b is the block number where b is located, floor_b is the floor number where b is located. If floor_a == 1, the current value of floor_a is 1 and time_to_exit is 0. If floor_a is not equal to 1, time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1). direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15, reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)**
