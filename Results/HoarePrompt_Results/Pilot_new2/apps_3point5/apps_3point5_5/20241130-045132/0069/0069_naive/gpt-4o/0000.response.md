Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input correctly, calculates the balance of the string $s$, then creates a list of prefix balances. It then checks for each prefix if the difference between the desired balance $x$ and the prefix balance is divisible by the balance of the string and if the result is non-negative. If these conditions are met, it increments a counter to keep track of the number of prefixes with the desired balance. The program then outputs the count for each test case as specified. The implementation covers all possible cases and correctly calculates the number of prefixes with the desired balance or outputs -1 if there are an infinite number of such prefixes.
