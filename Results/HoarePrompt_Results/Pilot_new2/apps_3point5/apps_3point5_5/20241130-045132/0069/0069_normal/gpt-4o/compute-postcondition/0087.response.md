Output State: **index is increased by n + 2, balance is now equal to s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances is updated, T must be greater than 1, n is the integer value obtained from data at the index, x is the integer value obtained from data at index + 1, s is now equal to the string data[index + 2], balance is now equal to s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances[i] is updated, `i` is n + 3, `n` must be greater than n + 3, prefix_balances[i] is updated as per the given formula, prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**.
