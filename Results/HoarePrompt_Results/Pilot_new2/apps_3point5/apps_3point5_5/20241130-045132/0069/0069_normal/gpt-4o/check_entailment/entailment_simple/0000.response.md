Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ as described in the problem statement. It handles the case where an infinite number of prefixes exist by outputting -1. The logic for updating the `results` list based on the calculated values is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
