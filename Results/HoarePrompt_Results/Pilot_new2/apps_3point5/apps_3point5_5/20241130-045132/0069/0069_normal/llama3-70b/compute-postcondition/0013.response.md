Postcondition: ***Output State: balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1. All other variables remain the same. The balance is not equal to x. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), then the program remains in its initial state. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0), then balance is updated to cnt0 - cnt1, all other variables remain the same, and the print statement returns ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1).***
