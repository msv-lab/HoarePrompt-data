Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully follow the problem description. It calculates the balance of the input binary string correctly and creates a list of prefix balances. However, the logic for determining the number of prefixes with a specific balance is not correctly implemented.

The program should handle cases where the number of prefixes with a specific balance is infinite. The program currently does not address this and simply checks if the desired balance exists in the prefix balances list, which is incorrect.

The program should be updated to correctly handle cases where the number of prefixes with a specific balance is infinite based on the problem description.
