According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the prefix_balances list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, index is 1, balance is the second element in prefix_balances, prefix_balances has at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the prefix_balances list must have at least 3 elements, and the balance is the third element in the list.
State: **index is 1, balance is the third element in prefix_balances, prefix_balances has at least 3 elements, if (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, count is increased by 1**
