Postcondition: ***index is increased by n + 1, balance is the result of s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the differences in counts of '0' and '1' up to that index in the string s, starting from index 0. In the if part when balance == 0, the current value of balance is 0. If x is in prefix_balances, a new element -1 is appended to results. If x is not in prefix_balances, a new element 0 is appended to results. In the else part, index is the length of prefix_balances - 1, balance is the last element in prefix_balances, prefix_balances has at least index + 1 elements. If (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, count is equal to the number of valid conditions met during the loop execution. results now include the updated count.***
