Output State: **`n` is equal to the second element of the data list, `x` is equal to the third element of the data list, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is incremented by 3, `results` contains the value of `count`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n+1` where each element is the cumulative sum of the changes based on the condition in the loop, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0), `prefix_balances` has at least `n` elements and ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is true.**
