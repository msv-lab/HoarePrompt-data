Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly counts the number of employees in each fraction and prints 'D' if the number of depublicans is greater than the number of remocrats, and 'R' otherwise. It follows the problem description for every potential case as it accurately implements the voting procedure described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
