Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It counts the number of depublicans and remocrats and then compares them to determine the outcome of the vote. The program handles the scenario where employees deny others the right to vote and skips their turn accordingly. The output produced is in line with the expected result based on the input provided. Since the program works as expected for all potential cases, it is correct.
