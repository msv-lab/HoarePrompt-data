Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input, counts the number of employees in each fraction, and then determines the outcome of the vote based on the counts. It follows the problem description by simulating the voting process where employees can deny others the right to vote until only one employee is left to determine the outcome. The program always outputs the correct result based on the described voting process.
