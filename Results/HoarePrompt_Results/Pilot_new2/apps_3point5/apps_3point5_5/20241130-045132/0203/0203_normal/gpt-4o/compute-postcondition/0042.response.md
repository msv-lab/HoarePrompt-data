Postcondition: ***After not entering the if block and instead entering the else block, `n` is the original input integer, `votes` is the string with at least one character, `i` is equal to the total number of characters in the votes string minus 1. If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is empty. If `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` is empty, and `d_queue` is also empty.***
