Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply counts the number of depublicans and remocrats and declares the winner based on which fraction has more members. However, the code does not simulate the actual voting process as described in the problem description.

For example, consider the input `6` followed by `DDRRRR`. In this case, the code would output 'D' since there are more depublicans than remocrats. However, if we simulate the voting process according to the description, we would see that the final outcome would actually be 'R'. This discrepancy between the expected outcome as per the problem description and the output of the code highlights that the code is not correct.
