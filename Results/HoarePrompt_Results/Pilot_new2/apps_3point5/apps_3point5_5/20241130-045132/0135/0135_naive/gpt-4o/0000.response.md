Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if all the remainders of n divided by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far and returns 'No' if a duplicate remainder is encountered. It covers all potential cases as mentioned in the problem description.
