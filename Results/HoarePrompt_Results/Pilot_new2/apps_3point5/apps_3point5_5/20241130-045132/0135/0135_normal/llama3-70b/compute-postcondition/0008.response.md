Output State: **`n` is not involved in loop execution, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder` after executing the code, `remainder` is the value of `n` modulo `i`. If the remainder is in the set `seen`, then the condition is met, and `remainder` has been seen before in the set `seen`. The statement 'No' is printed.**
