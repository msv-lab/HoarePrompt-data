Output State: **`n` is not involved in loop execution, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the new value of `remainder` at the current iteration, `remainder` is the value of `n` modulo `i`, where `i` is the current value of `i` in the current iteration, the new value of `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, if `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No'.**
