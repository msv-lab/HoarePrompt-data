Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, and returns 'No' if that is the case. Then, it iterates from 1 to k and checks if the remainder of n divided by i has been seen before using a set. If a remainder has been seen before, it returns 'No'. If no duplicate remainders are found, it returns 'Yes'.

This implementation ensures that all remainders are distinct as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
