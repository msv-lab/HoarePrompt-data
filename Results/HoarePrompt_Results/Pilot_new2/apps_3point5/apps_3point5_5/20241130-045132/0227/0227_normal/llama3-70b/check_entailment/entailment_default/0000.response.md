Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
- It then sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
- It iterates through the list and counts the number of elements that are not twice the previous element.
- If an element is not twice the previous element, it increments the variable `m`.
- After the loop, it prints the final value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for all valid inputs.
