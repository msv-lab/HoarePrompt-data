Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is intended to find the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the list of distinct positive integers and then iterates through the list to find the number of unique differences between elements. However, it fails to consider all possible combinations of variables that can achieve the required sequence of operations. 

For example, if the input is:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The correct output should be -1, as it is not possible to perform the sequence of operations with any number of variables. However, the code incorrectly outputs 2, which indicates a flaw in handling certain edge cases.
