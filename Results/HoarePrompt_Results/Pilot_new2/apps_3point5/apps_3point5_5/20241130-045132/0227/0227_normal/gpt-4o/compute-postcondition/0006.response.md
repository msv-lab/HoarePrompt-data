According to the code, the loop will execute based on the elements in the set `assigned`. Since the set `assigned` contains the first element of list `a` and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, the loop will execute if there is at least one element in the set `assigned`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `assigned` should not be empty.

State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is a set containing the first element of list a and not empty, m is 1, i is 1, can_form is False**
