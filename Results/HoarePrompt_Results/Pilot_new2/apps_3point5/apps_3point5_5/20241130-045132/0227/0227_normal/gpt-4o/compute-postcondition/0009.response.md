Output State: n is greater than 1, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is a set containing the first element of list a and not empty, m is 1, i is 1, can_form is True. The current value of i is such that (a[i] - x) is in assigned and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
