Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. 
- Function `func_1` checks if the number of unique digits in a given number `n` is less than or equal to `k`, which is a valid condition as per the problem statement.
- Function `func_2` iterates over all numbers in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive), and for each number, it checks if it satisfies the condition of having at most `k` different digits using `func_1`. If the condition is met, the number is added to the total sum, and then the sum is taken modulo `998244353`.
- The program handles the constraints specified in the problem description for the input range `1 <= l <= r < 10^18` and `1 <= k <= 10`.

Based on the code and the problem description, the program seems correct and covers all potential cases.
