#State of the program right berfore the function call: **l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_1(l, r, k):

    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #The program returns the difference between the count of numbers divisible by k in the range from l to r (inclusive) and the count of numbers divisible by k in the range from 1 to l-1 (inclusive), modulo MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. It calculates the count of numbers divisible by `k` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and subtracts the count of numbers divisible by `k` in the range from 1 to `l-1` (inclusive). The result is then returned modulo MOD.

    #The program returns the value stored in dp[n, k] after updating it based on the conditions provided
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. It first checks if `k` is 0 and returns 0. Then, it checks if the pair `(n, k)` exists in the `dp` dictionary and returns the corresponding value if it does. If not present, it calculates the value based on the conditions provided. If `n` is less than 10 to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10 to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is updated with specific calculations involving `n`, `k`, and previous `dp` values. Finally, the function returns the updated value stored in `dp[n, k]`. The functionality covers cases where `k` is 0, the pair `(n, k)` exists in `dp`, and all other conditions for updating `dp[n, k]`.
