According to the code, the loop will execute if k is at least 2. Before the loop starts, n should be such that 10^k <= n <= 10^18, where k is an integer between 1 and 10. Also, the pair (n, k) should not be in the dp dictionary and (n >= 10 and dp[n, k] = 9. At the start of the loop, i is 1 and it iterates until k-1. 
State: **n is an integer such that 10^k <= n <= 10^18 (where k is an integer between 1 and 10), dp is a dictionary to store computed values, k is not equal to 0, (n, k) is not in dp, (n >= 10 and dp[n, k] = 9), i is 1**
