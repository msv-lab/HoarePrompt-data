Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes in the number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay has and calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be bought based on the ratios given in the problem description. It then prints the total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook the compote. The code correctly computes the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use for the compote according to the specified ratios. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code as they describe the purpose of the function and its functionality accurately. Since the code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints support this, the correctness of the code is deemed to be True.
