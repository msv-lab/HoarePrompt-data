Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It ensures that the fruits are in the ratio 1:2:4 by finding the minimum number of lemons, apples, and pears based on the available quantities. The formula used to calculate the maximum total number is also correct as it includes the correct multiplication factors for each fruit type. The program handles all possible cases where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook the compote by returning 0 in such scenarios. Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
