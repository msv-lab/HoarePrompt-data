According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has no occurrence of any character from the initial `alphabet`, `alphabet` is empty, `res` contains all the characters processed so far plus the values of all characters in `alphabet`, `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string, and `res` is updated to include the value of `char`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` has no occurrence of any character from the initial `alphabet`, `alphabet` is empty, `res` contains all the characters processed so far plus the values of all characters in `alphabet`, `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string, and `res` is updated to include the value of `char`, `char` must be in `s`**
