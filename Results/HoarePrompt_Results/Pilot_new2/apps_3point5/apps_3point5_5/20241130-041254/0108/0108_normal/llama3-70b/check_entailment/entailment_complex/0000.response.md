Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It takes a string `s`, iterates through the alphabet, and replaces each character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet order. If the length of the result string `res` is 26 after processing all characters, it means that all characters in the alphabet have been used as a subsequence, and it prints out the concatenated characters in alphabetical order. Otherwise, if the length of `res` is not 26, it prints -1 as it is not possible to obtain the required subsequence. The program always outputs the expected result as described in the problem.
