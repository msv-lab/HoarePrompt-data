Postcondition: ***`s` is an empty string, `alphabet` is an empty string, `res` contains all the characters in the alphabet string concatenated together, `char` is the last character processed from the alphabet string. If the length of `res` is 26, then all characters of the alphabet string are processed and the function terminates. If the length of `res` is not 26, the function prints -1 and does not affect any of the variables.***
