Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string 's' and iterates through it while checking if the characters match with the characters in the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If a match is found, it moves to the next character in the target string. If at the end of the iteration, all characters in the target string have been matched, it prints out the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The program logic is sound and covers all potential cases, making it correct.
