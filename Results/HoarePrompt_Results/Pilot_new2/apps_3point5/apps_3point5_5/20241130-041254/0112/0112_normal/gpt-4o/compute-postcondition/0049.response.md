Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `used_cubes` is a list where at least one element is True, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, there are more digits left in the `digits` list. If (not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]), then the current value of used_cubes[i] is False and digit is in cube_faces[i]***
