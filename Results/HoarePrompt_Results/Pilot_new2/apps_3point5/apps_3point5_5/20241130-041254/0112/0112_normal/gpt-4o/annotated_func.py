#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_1(n, cubes):
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]

    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1

    return x
    #The program returns the value of x which is 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts parameters `n` and `cubes`, creates a set of cube faces for each cube in the input list, iterates to find the maximum number x such that can_form_number(x + 1) returns True, and finally returns the value of x, which is 3.

def can_form_number(num):
    digits = list(str(num))
    used_cubes = [False] * n
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: At the end of the loop, `found` will be True, `used_cubes` will be a list where all elements are True, `i` will be equal to n-1, `n` is a positive integer, and there are no more digits left in the `digits` list.
    return True
    #The program returns True after the loop where 'found' is set to True, 'used_cubes' is a list with all elements being True, 'i' is equal to n-1 (where n is a positive integer), and there are no more digits left in the 'digits' list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_form_number` takes a non-negative integer `num` as input, which represents the maximum number that Masha can form using her cubes. It then iterates through the digits of `num`, checking if each digit can be formed using the available cube faces. If any digit cannot be formed, the function returns False. If all digits can be formed, it returns True. The function includes multiple return cases for different scenarios, ensuring that Masha's ability to form the number is accurately determined based on the cube faces available.
