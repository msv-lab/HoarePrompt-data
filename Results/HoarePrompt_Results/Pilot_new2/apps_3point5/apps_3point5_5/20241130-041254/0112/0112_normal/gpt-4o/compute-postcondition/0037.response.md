According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`, as well as the conditions related to `used_cubes[i]` and `digit` in `cube_faces[i]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `found` may or may not be True, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means we need to ensure that the conditions related to `used_cubes[i]` and `digit` in `cube_faces[i]` are properly set for the next iteration.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`found` may or may not be True, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**. Adjust conditions related to `used_cubes[i]` and `digit` in `cube_faces[i]` accordingly.
