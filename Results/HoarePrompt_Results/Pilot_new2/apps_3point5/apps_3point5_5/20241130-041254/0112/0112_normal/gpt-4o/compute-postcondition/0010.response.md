According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variables `n` and `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` that is not empty, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the current value at index `i` set to True, `digit` is the first digit in the list of digits, `found` is set to True, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `i` should be incremented by 1.
