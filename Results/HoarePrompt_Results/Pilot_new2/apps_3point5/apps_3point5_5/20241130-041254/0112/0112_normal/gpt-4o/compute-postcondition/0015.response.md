According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` that is not empty, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with the current value at index `i` set to True, `digit` is the first digit in the list of `digits`, `found` is set to True, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[i]` is set to True. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Additionally, the value at index `i` in `used_cubes` needs to be updated to True.

State: num is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes, digits is a list containing the individual digits of num that is not empty, used_cubes is a list of n elements with the current value at index i set to True, digit is the first digit in the list of digits, found is set to True, n must be greater than 1, i is 2, used_cubes[i] is set to True.
