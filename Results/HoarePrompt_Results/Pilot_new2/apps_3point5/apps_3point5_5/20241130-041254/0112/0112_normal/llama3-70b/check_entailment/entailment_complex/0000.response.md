Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads the input correctly, stores the digits from the cubes excluding '0', and then finds the maximum number that can be formed using these digits. It follows the problem description accurately and prints the correct output for the given problem scenario. The program correctly handles the case where there can be cubes with digits only from 0 to 9 and removes '0' if present in the digits set. Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.
