Based on the code and the problem description, the initial assessment is as follows:

1. The `can_form_number` function checks if Masha can form a given number using the available cube faces.
2. The `func_1` function iteratively finds the maximum number x that Masha can form using her cubes.

Now, let's analyze if the output hints are consistent with the code and if they depict any potential cases where the code might fail to follow the problem description.

Output hints for function1:
The function `func_1` returns the maximum number x such that `can_form_number(x + 1)` returns True. The output hint mentions the value of x as 3. However, it does not provide more specific details regarding the correctness.

Output hints for function2:
The function `can_form_number` checks if Masha can form a given number using the available cube faces. It iterates through the digits of the number and checks if each digit can be formed. The function includes multiple return cases for different scenarios to accurately determine Masha's ability to form the number based on the cube faces available.

Considering the problem description, the code appears to correctly determine the maximum number that Masha can form using her cubes. The iterative approach in `func_1` and the digit-checking mechanism in `can_form_number` seem to align with the requirements specified in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the analysis and understanding of the code and problem description, the Correctness is:

Correctness: **True**.
