The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function does not return any value but prints all the possible combinations of a cube with 6 faces containing digits from 0 to 9. The function adheres to the constraints that n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, representing the number of cubes. Each cube has 6 faces with a digit from 0 to 9. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to print all possible combinations of the cubes based on the constraints provided.
