Functionality: **The function reads three integer inputs, a, b, and c, and checks if b equals a. If b is equal to a, it prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it checks if c is equal to 0. If c is 0, it prints 'NO'. If c is not 0, it checks if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative. If these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
