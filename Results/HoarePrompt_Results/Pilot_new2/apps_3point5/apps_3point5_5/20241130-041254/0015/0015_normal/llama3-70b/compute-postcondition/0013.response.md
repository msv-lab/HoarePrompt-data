Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. If c == 0, then if a == b, the values of a, b, and c remain unchanged. Otherwise, if a != b, the code prints 'NO' and the values of a, b, and c remain unchanged. If c != 0, and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed.***
