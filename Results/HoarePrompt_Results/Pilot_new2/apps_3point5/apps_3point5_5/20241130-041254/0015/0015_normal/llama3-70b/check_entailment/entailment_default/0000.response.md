Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
- If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. This correctly handles the case where the favorite number `b` is equal to the first element of the sequence.
- If `c` is not 0, it verifies if `b - a` is divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This accurately determines if the favorite number `b` can appear in the sequence based on the difference `c` between elements.
