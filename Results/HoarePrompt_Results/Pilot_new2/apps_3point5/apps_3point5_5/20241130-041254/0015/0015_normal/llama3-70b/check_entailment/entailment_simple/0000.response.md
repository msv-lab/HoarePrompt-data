Correctness: True

The program correctly determines if Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence s based on the difference c between neighboring elements.
1. If c is 0, it checks if a is equal to b. If they are equal, it prints 'YES', indicating that b appears in the sequence. If they are not equal, it prints 'NO', indicating that b does not appear in the sequence.
2. If c is not 0, it checks if (b - a) is divisible evenly by c and if the result is non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program follows the problem description for all cases where -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9.
