Example Answer: 
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. 
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9**
