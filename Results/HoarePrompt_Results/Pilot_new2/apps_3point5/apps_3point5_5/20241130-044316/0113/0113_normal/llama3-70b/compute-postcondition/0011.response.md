Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where 1 <= n <= 10^9 and 0 <= k <= 8. It reads input values for `n` and `k`, calculates the value of x as 10 to the power of k, then increments `n` until it is divisible by x. Finally, it prints the adjusted value of `n`. The function lacks a return statement, so it does not explicitly return any value. **
