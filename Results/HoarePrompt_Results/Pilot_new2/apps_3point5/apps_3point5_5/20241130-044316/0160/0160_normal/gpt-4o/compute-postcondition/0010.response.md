According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: N, K, A_i, x, i+1, divisors.add(i), divisors.add(x // i) where x % i == 0. Since `i` increases by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted by adding 1.
State: **N, K, A_i, x, i+2, divisors.add(i+1), divisors.add(x // (i+1)) where x % (i+1) == 0**
