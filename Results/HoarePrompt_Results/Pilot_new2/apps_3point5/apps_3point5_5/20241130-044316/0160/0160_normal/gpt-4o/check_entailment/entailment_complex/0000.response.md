Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because function 2 is missing a check to handle the case where x is a perfect square. This check is necessary to ensure that the square root of x is not counted twice as a divisor. This means that for certain inputs where x is a perfect square, the program may not produce the correct output as per the problem description.
