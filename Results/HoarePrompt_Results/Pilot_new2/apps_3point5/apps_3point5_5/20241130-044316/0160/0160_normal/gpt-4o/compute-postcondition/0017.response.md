Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts an integer parameter x and calculates all the divisors of x. It then returns a set of these divisors sorted in reverse order. The function correctly identifies all divisors of x by iterating up to the square root of x and checking for divisibility. However, it seems to be missing a check to handle the case where x is a perfect square, ensuring that the square root is not counted twice.**
