Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements that can be achieved by performing exactly one swap. The program finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and maximum element (n) in the array, calculates the distances in all possible cases by considering swapping the minimum and maximum elements with the ends of the array, and then outputs the maximum distance. The logic implemented in the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and produces the correct output.
