Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input integers, finds the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the list, calculates the distances of these elements from the boundaries of the list, and then determines the maximum distance possible. Finally, it prints this maximum distance, which aligns with the requirements of the problem.

The program always performs the necessary calculations to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements by considering all possible positions for these elements. Hence, it satisfies the problem description for all potential cases.
