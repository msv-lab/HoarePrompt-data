Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer input `n`, followed by a list of integers. It then calculates the maximum distance of the indices of the first element `1` and the last element `n` in the list from the boundaries (`0` and `n-1`). Finally, it prints the maximum calculated distance. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
