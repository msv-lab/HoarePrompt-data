Correctness: **True**

The program takes an input integer between 0 and 99 and converts it to its word representation, following the rules outlined in the problem description. It correctly handles cases where the input number is less than 10, between 10 and 19, and greater than or equal to 20 by printing the corresponding word representation. The program uses predefined lists for ones, teens, and tens to build the word representation based on the input number, as specified in the problem description. Thus, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description.
