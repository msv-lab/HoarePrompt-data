Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` in the range of 0 to 99 and returns the string representation of `n` based on the specified cases:
- If `n` corresponds to a single-digit number, it returns the string representation from the 'ones' list.
- If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representation from the 'teens' list.
- If `n` represents a number in the tens place, it returns the string representation of the tens place digit.
- If `n` is a two-digit number, it returns the string representation where the tens place is obtained from the 'tens' list and the ones place is obtained from the 'ones' list, separated by a hyphen.

The code handles all these cases correctly, providing the appropriate word representation of the integer score `s` input by Tavas. The output hints also align with the functionality of the code, confirming that it accurately converts the numeric score to its word representation as required by the problem description.
