Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly handles the cases where the input integer corresponds to a single-digit number, a number between 11 and 19, a number in the tens place, and a two-digit number. The logic in the function `func_1` ensures that the correct string representation is returned for each case as specified in the problem description. The annotations provided in the code also clearly outline the different scenarios and how they are handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct and produces the desired output for all possible cases.
