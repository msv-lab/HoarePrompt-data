According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity and `chosen_route` is -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0**
