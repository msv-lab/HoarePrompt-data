Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s_i` is the source bus stop of route `i`, `d_i` is the destination bus stop of route `i`, and `s_i` is less than `t`. If the condition ((t - s_i) % d_i == 0) is true, `wait_time` is 0. If the condition is false, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
