Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer, buses contains at least i+3 tuples, min_time is equal to the current value of time, ans is i + 1 if time < min_time, otherwise it remains -1, i is 3, s and d are values from the (i+1)th tuple in the list, time is the result of the calculation (t - s) % d, and ans is equal to 4.***
