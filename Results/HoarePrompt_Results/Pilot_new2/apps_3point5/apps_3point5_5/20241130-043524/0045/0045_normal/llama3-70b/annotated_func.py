#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.**
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `n` and `k`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10, and calculates the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function achieves this by iteratively updating `a` and `b` until `b` becomes 0. It then returns the final value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor.
