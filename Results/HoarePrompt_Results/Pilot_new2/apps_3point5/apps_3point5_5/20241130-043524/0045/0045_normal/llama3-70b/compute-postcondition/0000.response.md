According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `b` evaluates to True. Right before the loop, the condition `b` is not specified, so we need to adjust the states of `n` and `k` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

To guarantee that the loop executes at least once, we can set the condition `b` to be True by adjusting `n` and `k` such that they are positive integers. Therefore, both `n` and `k` must be positive integers for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10**
