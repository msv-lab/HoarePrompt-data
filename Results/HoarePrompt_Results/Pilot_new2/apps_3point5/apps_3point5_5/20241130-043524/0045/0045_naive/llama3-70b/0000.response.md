Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes two inputs n and k, representing a positive integer number and the length of the sequence to be created. It then calculates the maximal sequence of positive numbers where their sum is equal to n and their greatest common divisor is maximal.

The program iterates through the numbers from 1 to k, and for each number, it checks if it can be added to the sequence such that the sum doesn't exceed n. If it can, the number is added to the sequence and n is updated accordingly. If the final sequence length is not equal to k, the program outputs -1. Otherwise, it prints the resulting sequence.

The program works correctly as it follows the problem description and generates a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers with the given constraints. Since all potential cases have been considered and tested in the program logic, the correctness is True.
