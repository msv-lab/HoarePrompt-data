According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` do not affect the loop execution directly. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
