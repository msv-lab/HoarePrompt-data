Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `r` contains the final remainder after the division is completed for all elements in `s`, `b[i]` is updated based on the previous iteration, `i` is incremented, `i` is less than `m`. If shares > 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. If shares <= 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
