Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `shares` > 0, `shares` is set to 0, `r` is adjusted based on the value of `shares`, `b[i]` is updated, `i` is incremented, and `i` is less than `m + 1. `r` remains unchanged. If `shares` is not greater than 0, `shares` is updated based on certain conditions, `r` is adjusted according to the value of `shares`, `b[i]` is updated, `i` is incremented, and `i` is less than `m + 1. In both cases, the program continues updating variables until `i` reaches `m + 1` or a break statement is encountered, resulting in the end of the loop or if statement.***
