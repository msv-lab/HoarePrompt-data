Correctness: **True**

The program takes in the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the amount of bourles you hold. It then calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it simply prints the amount of bourles you hold. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares you can buy with the bourles you hold, and then calculates the total bourles you will have after selling all those shares at the maximum sell price.

The program correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all possible cases.
