The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from the input. It then reads two lists `s` and `b` of integers. The function calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the total bourles by considering the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining bourles, and the maximum sell price. The function does not explicitly return any value.
