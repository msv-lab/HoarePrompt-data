Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, then `shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` and `s[0]`, and `r` is assigned the remainder of `r` divided by `s[0]`. If `r` is less than `s[0]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
