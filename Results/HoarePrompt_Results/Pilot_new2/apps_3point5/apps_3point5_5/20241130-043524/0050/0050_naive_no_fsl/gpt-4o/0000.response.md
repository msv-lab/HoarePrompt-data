Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum buy price, maximum sell price, and then determines whether it is profitable to buy and sell stocks. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it simply prints the current amount of bourles you have. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining bourles after buying those shares, and then calculates the total bourles after selling those shares. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem.
