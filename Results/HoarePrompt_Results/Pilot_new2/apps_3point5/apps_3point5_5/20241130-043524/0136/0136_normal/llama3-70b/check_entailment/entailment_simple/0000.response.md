Correctness: **True**

The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as input, each potentially with leading zeros. It then compares a and b, and prints "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b. The program correctly handles the cases where a is less than, greater than, or equal to b. It also handles the case where there are leading zeros in the input numbers by stripping them before the comparison.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for in every potential case.
