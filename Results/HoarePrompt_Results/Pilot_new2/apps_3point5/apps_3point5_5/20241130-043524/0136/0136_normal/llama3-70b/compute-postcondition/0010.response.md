Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer with at most 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer with at most 10^6 digits where `b` is the input string after removing any leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the program does nothing. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the program compares the values. If `a` is less than `b`, then the program prints '<'. Otherwise, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
