Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` with at most 10^6 digits as input.
- It then compares the values of `a` and `b`.
- If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='.
- If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'.
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints '>'.
  
The code correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. It handles the case where `a` is less than `b`, `a` is equal to `b`, and `a` is greater than `b`. The code effectively trims any leading zeroes in the input integers before comparison. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming its correctness.
