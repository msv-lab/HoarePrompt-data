Correctness: **True**

The program reads two non-negative integers represented as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares them to determine which one is greater, less than, or equal to the other. The program correctly handles cases where the numbers have different lengths and correctly compares the numbers. The program outputs "<" if the first number is less than the second, ">", if the first number is greater than the second, and "=" if they are equal. 

The logic in the program follows the problem description accurately and covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description. Hence, the program is correct based on the problem requirements.
