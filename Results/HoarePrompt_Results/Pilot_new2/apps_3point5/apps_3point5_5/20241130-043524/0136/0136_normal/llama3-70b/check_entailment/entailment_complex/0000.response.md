Correctness: **True**

The program reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` with at most 10^6 digits as input. It then compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints the correct symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison. The program correctly handles cases where `a` is less than, greater than, or equal to `b`, as specified in the problem description.
