Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days as described in the problem statement. It uses the formula to calculate the probability and then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form. The program also takes the modulo of the final answer to prevent any overflow errors. The logic and implementation seem correct for all potential cases.
