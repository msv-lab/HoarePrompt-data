Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday given the number of days in Udayland and the number of people being interviewed.
2. The program calculates A and B as required, ensuring that they are coprime before taking their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3.
3. The program uses the Euclidean algorithm in `func_1` to find the greatest common divisor of A and B efficiently.
4. The program handles all edge cases, such as when k is greater than the total number of days in Udayland, and prints the correct output as specified in the problem description.
