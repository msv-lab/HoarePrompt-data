The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the function returns the value of k shifted left by n with MOD assigned the value 10^6 + 3. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers n and k, and return the value of k shifted left by n with MOD as 10^6 + 3.
