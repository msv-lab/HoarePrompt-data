Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. The program computes the numerator and denominator values based on the input n and k, calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator, and then returns the remainders of these values divided by (10^6 + 3) as required. The program follows the problem description faithfully and provides the desired output in the required format.
