According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is at least 1. Given that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, the loop will always execute. Before the loop starts, the total_days is equal to 2 raised to the power of n, numerator is 1, and denominator is 1. 
So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `i` starts at 0.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is equal to 2 raised to the power of n; numerator = 1; denominator = 1; i is 0**
