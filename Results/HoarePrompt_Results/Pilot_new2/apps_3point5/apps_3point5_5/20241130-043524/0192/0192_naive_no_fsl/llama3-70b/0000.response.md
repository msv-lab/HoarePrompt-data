Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. It simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which represents the number of seconds needed to modify the sides of the triangle until it reaches the desired length. The program works as expected for all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
