Correctness: **True**

The program takes two integers x and y as input, where x is the starting equilateral triangle side length and y is the ending equilateral triangle side length. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from x following the rules provided in the problem description.

The formula used in the program: `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds needed. This formula works because each second, Memory can reduce the side length of the triangle by 2 units until it reaches the desired side length y. The `(x - y) // 2` part calculates the number of steps needed to reach y by decrementing 2 units each time. The `(x - y) % 2` part ensures that if the difference between x and y is odd, an extra step is added to reach the desired side length y.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
