Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting equilateral triangle of side length x. It follows the problem description by reading two integers x and y from input, ensuring that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and then calculating ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2) to determine the minimum number of seconds required. The examples provided in the description also align with the output of the code. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
