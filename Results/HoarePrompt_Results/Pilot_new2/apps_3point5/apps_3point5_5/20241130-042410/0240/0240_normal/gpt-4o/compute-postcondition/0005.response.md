According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the permutations of `chars`. If there are more permutations left, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of `sub`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more permutations left, so the next permutation needs to be generated. This means adjusting the state to consider the next permutation.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the next permutation of `sub`.**
