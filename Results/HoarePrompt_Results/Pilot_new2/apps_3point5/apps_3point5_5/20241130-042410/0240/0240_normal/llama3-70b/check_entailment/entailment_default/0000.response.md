Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes in two string parameters `s` and `t`.
- It iterates through string `s` and collects characters that are also present in substring `t` into a new string `n`.
- It then appends substring `t` to the end of `n` and returns the integer value of the resulting string `n`.
- The function handles cases where `s` and `t` can contain leading zeroes.
- The code aligns with the problem description as it accurately reconstructs the smallest possible initial integer `n` based on the provided substring `t` and string `s`.

The output hints also agree with the code in describing the functionality of the `func_1` function. The code performs as expected for all potential cases outlined in the problem description.
