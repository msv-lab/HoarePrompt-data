Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully match the problem description. The function `func_1` should check if the input string is a "s-palindrome" by comparing the characters from the first half of the string with the characters from the second half in a mirror fashion. However, the loop in the function only iterates through the first half of the string. This means that the function will not correctly handle cases where the input string is not symmetric about the middle. For example, if the input string is "oXoxoXo", the function will incorrectly return True because it only checks the first half of the string. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.
