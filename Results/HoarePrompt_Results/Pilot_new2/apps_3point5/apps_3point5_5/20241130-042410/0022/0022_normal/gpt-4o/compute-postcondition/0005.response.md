According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is at least 2, and the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in `s` are equal. Since the loop increments `i` by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least `2 + 2 = 4`.
State: **s is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, n is at least 4, i is 1**
