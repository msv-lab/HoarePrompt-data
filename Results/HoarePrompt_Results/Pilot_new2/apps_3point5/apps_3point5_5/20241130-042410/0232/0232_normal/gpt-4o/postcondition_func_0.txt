The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It creates a dictionary `desired_counts` mapping colors to their desired counts. It then iterates through the list of colors, updating the counts in `current_counts`. If the counts of all colors match the desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The program handles cases where the count of a color in `current_counts` is still greater than or equal to the desired count, and it increments the 'left' index by 2 in a specific case. The function conforms to the postconditions in cases where it returns 'YES' or 'NO'.
