Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `found` is either True if the condition is met or False if the condition is not met, `window_counts` is a dictionary where each color in `colors` is a key, and the value is the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list within the range of `i` to `n`, `i` is the last value in the range of the loop, `color` is the last color in the `colors` list. If `found` is True, then the condition is met, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Then, the program prints 'YES' if `found` is True, else 'NO'.**
