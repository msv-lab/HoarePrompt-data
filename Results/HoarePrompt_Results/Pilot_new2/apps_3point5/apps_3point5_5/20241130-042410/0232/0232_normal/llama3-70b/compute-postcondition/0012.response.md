Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `colors` still contains at least 1 color, `counts` is a list with mapped integers from the input split. If `color` is not in `color_counts`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` and value 0. After the code executes, the value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `color_counts[color]` becomes 1.**
