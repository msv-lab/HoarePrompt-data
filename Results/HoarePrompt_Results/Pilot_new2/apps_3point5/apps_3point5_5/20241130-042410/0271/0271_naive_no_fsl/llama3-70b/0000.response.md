Correctness: True

The provided Python program correctly rounds the given non-negative integer to the nearest integer that ends with 0, as described in the problem statement. The logic implemented in the program covers all potential cases, including when the input integer already ends with 0. The program checks if the input is divisible by 10, and if so, it directly prints the input itself. Otherwise, it calculates the nearest integer by rounding down if the last digit is less than or equal to 5, or rounding up if the last digit is greater than 5. Therefore, based on the problem description and the logic implemented in the program, it is correct for all cases.
