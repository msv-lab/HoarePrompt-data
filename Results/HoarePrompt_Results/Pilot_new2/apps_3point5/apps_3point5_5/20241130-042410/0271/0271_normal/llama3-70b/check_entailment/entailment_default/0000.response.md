Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly rounds the non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it adjusts `n` based on whether `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5, and then prints the adjusted value. The code handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement and gives the correct output for all provided examples.
