Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes an input integer `n`, and then rounds it to the nearest integer ending in 0. If `n` is already divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it adjusts `n` by subtracting `n % 10` if `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, or by adding `(10 - n % 10)` if `n % 10` is greater than 5. This logic is in line with the problem description and ensures that `n` is rounded to the nearest integer ending in 0.
