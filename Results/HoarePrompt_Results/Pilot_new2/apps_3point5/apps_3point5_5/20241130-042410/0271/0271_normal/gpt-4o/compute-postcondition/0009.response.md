Functionality: **The function reads an integer input n, calculates the remainder of n divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, it calculates a result. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is n minus the remainder; otherwise, the result is n plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. The function then prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any output.**
