Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a non-negative integer input `n`, calculates the remainder when divided by 10, and then rounds `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0 by subtracting or adding the remainder accordingly. The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
