Postcondition: ***x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. x is not greater than y + z is true. x is not less than y, x is greater than or equal to y, x is not greater than y + z. x is equal to y. If z == 0, then z remains 0. If z != 0, then z is updated to a non-zero value.***
