Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It considers all possible cases where the result could be "+", "-", or "?". It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the given input values and then compares those ranges to determine the result. It correctly identifies whether the result is certain or uncertain and prints the correct output accordingly.

The "if-else" structure correctly handles all scenarios as described in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct and follows the requirements stated in the problem description.
