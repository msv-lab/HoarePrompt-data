Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z as input and computes the minimum and maximum values for upvotes and downvotes. Then, based on the comparisons of these values, the code determines whether the result is '+', '-', or '?'. The code also considers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and help confirm that the code does indeed handle all scenarios as described. Thus, the code is correct for all potential cases.
