#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #The program returns the result of subtracting the count of numbers between l and r that are divisible by k from the count of numbers between 1 and l-1 that are divisible by k, and then taking the result modulo MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers l, r, and k, calculates the subtraction of the count of numbers between l and r that are divisible by k from the count of numbers between 1 and l-1 that are divisible by k. The function then returns the result modulo MOD. The function utilizes a dictionary dp for memoization. The code does not handle cases where MOD is not defined or where l or r are outside the specified range. It also assumes the existence of the count function to calculate the counts of numbers divisible by k within given ranges.

    if (n < 10 ** k) :
        dp[n, k] = n

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop finish, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `dp` contains the calculated result for dp[n, k], (n, k) is in dp with the value calculated from the loop code,  `i` is equal to k
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        dp[n, k] %= MOD

If n < 10^k, dp[(n, k)] = n. After the execution of the if else block, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, dp contains the calculated result for dp[n, k], (n, k) is in dp with the value calculated from the loop code, `i` is equal to k, and dp[n, k] is increased by 10 and then taken modulo MOD.
    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value of dp[n, k] after increasing by 10 and taking modulo MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `count` takes three parameters `n, k, dp`. `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 to 10^18 and 1 to 10 respectively. `dp` is a dictionary used to store previous results. The function handles three cases: 

Case 1: If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0.

Case 2: If the pair `(n, k)` exists in `dp`, the function returns the value stored for that pair in the dictionary.

Case 3: If the pair `(n, k)` does not exist in `dp`, the function calculates the value based on the conditions provided in the code. If `n` is less than 10^k, `dp[(n, k)]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, the value is calculated using a loop and then modified further before being returned. The return value is `dp[n, k]` after being increased by 10 and taken modulo `MOD`.

Overall, the functionality of the function `count` is to handle different cases based on the input parameters and return specific values accordingly.
