According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18. Given that `num` is equal to `l`, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next iteration would involve `num` being equal to (l + 1), `l` and `r` remain the same, `k` remains the same, and `total_sum` remains the same.
State: **l + 1 and r are integers such that 1 <= l + 1 <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, total_sum is an integer**
