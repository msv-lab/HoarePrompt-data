According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range from l to r inclusive has at least 1 number. So, for the loop to execute, the range from l to r must have at least 1 number, and at the start of the loop, num should be equal to l and total_sum should be 0.

State: **l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, total_sum is 0, num is equal to l**
