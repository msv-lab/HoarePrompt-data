Correctness: **True**

Initial Assessment:
The code seems to be calculating the sum of numbers from l to r, where each number contains at most k different digits. It utilizes two functions, func_1 and func_2, to check if a number satisfies the condition of having at most k different digits and then calculates the total sum accordingly. The code structure appears to align with the problem description.

Output Hint Analysis:
The output hints describe the functionality of func_1 and func_2 accurately. The hints provide a clear explanation of how the functions work and what they aim to achieve. They confirm that func_1 checks if the number of unique digits in a number is less than or equal to k, and func_2 calculates the sum of numbers from l to r that satisfy this condition. The hints do not present any conflicting information or edge cases that are not covered by the code.

Conclusion:
Based on the initial assessment and the agreement between the code and the output hints, it can be concluded that the code is correct. The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly calculates the sum of numbers from l to r with at most k different digits.
