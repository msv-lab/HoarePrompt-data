Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code consists of two functions, func_1 and count, which work together to calculate the sum of numbers from l to r such that each number contains at most k different digits.
2. The code correctly handles the cases where l, r, and k are within the specified ranges (1 <= l <= r < 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10).
3. The code uses memoization to store previously calculated results in the dp dictionary, improving efficiency.
4. The count function correctly calculates the count of numbers within the specified range based on the conditions provided in the code.
5. The func_1 function calculates the desired sum modulo 998244353 by subtracting the count of numbers between l and r that are divisible by k from the count of numbers between 1 and l-1 that are divisible by k.
6. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it accurately calculates the sum of numbers meeting the criteria specified in the problem statement.
