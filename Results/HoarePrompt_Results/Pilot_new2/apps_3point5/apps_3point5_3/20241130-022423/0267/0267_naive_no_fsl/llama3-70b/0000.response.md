Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The function uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the counts of numbers with at most `k` different digits.

The function then calculates the sum of numbers in the range `[l, r]` by subtracting the count of numbers less than `l` with at most `k` different digits from the count of numbers less than or equal to `r` with at most `k` different digits. The final result is returned modulo `998244353`.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the function can efficiently calculate the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits for any given range `[l, r]`. The modulo operation is applied to the final result to ensure that the output is within the specified bounds. Thus, the code is correct for all inputs.
