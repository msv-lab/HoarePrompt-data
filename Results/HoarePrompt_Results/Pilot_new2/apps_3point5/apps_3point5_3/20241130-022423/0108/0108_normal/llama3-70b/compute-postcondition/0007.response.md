According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being present in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is equal to its previous value concatenated with `char`, and `char` is a lowercase letter present in `s`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `char` to the next character after its current value in the alphabet.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is equal to its previous value concatenated with `char`, and `char` is a lowercase letter present in `s`, `char` must be adjusted to the character that comes after its current value in the alphabet**
