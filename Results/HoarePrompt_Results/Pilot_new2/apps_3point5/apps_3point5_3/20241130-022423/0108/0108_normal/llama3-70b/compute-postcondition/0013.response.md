The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is present in the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with all occurrences of `char` replaced by the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` contains all occurrences of `char` concatenated in the order they were replaced, and `char` is not present in `s` after all iterations of the loop have executed.**
