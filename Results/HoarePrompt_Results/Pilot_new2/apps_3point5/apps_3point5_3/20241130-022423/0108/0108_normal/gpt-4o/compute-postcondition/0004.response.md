According to the code, the loop can execute if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. 

Right before the loop, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, either `i` needs to be less than the length of string `s` or `j` needs to be less than the length of string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted to either `i` is less than len(s) or `j` is less than 'target_len'.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` must be less than len(s) or `j` must be less than 'target_len'**
