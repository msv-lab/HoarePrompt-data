Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and then iterates over the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character exists in the input string `s`. If found, it appends that character to the result string `res` and replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. Finally, if the length of `res` is 26, it prints out `res`; otherwise, it prints -1.

This program correctly follows the problem description because it aims to create a string that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence by transforming the given input string `s`. The program ensures that the output string `res` has the characters of the alphabet in order, and it prints the result if all characters are present. If not, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to achieve the desired result.
