Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the input string `s` and iterates over the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character exists in the input string `s`. If found, it appends that character to the result string `res` and replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. Finally, if the length of `res` is 26, it prints out `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The code correctly handles the scenario where it is impossible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence by returning -1 in such cases. The code also performs the necessary replacements to achieve the desired subsequence.
