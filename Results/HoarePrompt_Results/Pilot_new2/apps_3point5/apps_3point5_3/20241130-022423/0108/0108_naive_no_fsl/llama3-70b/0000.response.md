Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input string and iterates through the alphabet. It replaces each character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet until it forms the alphabet sequence. If the resulting string has a length of 26, it prints the string; otherwise, it prints -1. The program follows the problem description for every potential case, ensuring that the output is either the alphabet sequence or -1 if it's impossible to obtain the alphabet sequence.
