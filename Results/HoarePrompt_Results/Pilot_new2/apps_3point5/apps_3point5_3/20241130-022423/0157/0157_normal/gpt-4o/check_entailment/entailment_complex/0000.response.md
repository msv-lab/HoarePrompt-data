Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by calculating the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It ensures that the fruits are used in the ratio 1:2:4 as required. The program calculates the maximum number of lemons based on the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4, and then computes the total number of fruits accordingly. The output is the maximum total number of fruits that can be used, which aligns with the problem description. The program covers all potential cases and correctly handles the scenario where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote.
