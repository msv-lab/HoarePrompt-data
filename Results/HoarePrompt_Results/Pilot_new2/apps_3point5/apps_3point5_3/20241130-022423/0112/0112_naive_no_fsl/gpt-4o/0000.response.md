Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that checks if Masha can form a number with the given cubes. It then iterates to find the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes to satisfy the condition. The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement by iterating through all possible numbers and checking if they can be formed using the available cubes. The code also correctly handles the constraint that the number cannot contain leading zeros.

The program uses a brute force approach to find the maximum number x that Masha can make, and it covers all possible cases by checking each number from 1 to x. Since the provided examples also work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
