Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not correctly implement the problem description. 

1. In the `func_1` function, the logic to increment `x` while `can_form_number(x + 1)` is not defined properly. The function `can_form_number` is called but it is not defined within the scope of `func_1`. This will result in a NameError when the function is executed.

2. The `can_form_number` function also uses variables `n` and `cube_faces` which are not defined within its scope. This will result in a NameError when the function is executed.

3. There is no actual implementation of how to check if the cubes can form numbers from 1 to x in the provided code. The logic to compare the cube faces with the required numbers to form x is missing.

Due to these issues, the program does not correctly implement the problem description and would not produce the desired output.
