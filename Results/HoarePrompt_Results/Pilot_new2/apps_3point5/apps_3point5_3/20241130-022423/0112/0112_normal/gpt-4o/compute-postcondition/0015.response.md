According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True with `used_cubes[i]` being False for the new `i`, `found` is True, `n` must be greater than the new `i`, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `found` is True. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state accordingly:
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True with `used_cubes[i]` being False for the new `i`, `found` is True, `n` must be greater than the new `i + 1`, `used_cubes[i+1]` is True, and `found` is True**.
