According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 3 inner lists, the loop executes again for the third time. 
At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 inner lists, `cube` is the second inner list in the `cubes` list, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the `cube` list updated with string representation of digits in `cube`. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least 3 inner lists, `cube` should be the third inner list in the `cubes` list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 inner lists, `cube` is the third inner list in the `cubes` list, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the `cube` list updated with string representation of digits in `cube`**
