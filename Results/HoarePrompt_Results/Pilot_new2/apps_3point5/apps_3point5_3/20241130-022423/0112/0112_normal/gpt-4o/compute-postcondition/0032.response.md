According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True except for `used_cubes[i]` which is now False, `found` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 and all other states remain the same.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True except for `used_cubes[i]` which is now False, `found` is True, `n` must be greater than 1, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
