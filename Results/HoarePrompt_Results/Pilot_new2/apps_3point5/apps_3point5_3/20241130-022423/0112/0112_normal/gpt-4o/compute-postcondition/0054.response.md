According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True except for the element at index `i` which is now True, `found` is True, `n` is equal to `num`, `i` is an index, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

For the loop to be executed one more time:
- `num` remains an integer greater than 0
- `digits` remains a list containing at least 2 digits
- `digit` remains the second last digit in the list
- All elements in `used_cubes` remain True except for the element at index `i` which is now True
- `found` remains True
- `n` remains equal to `num`
- `i` should be incremented by 1 to continue the loop

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True except for the element at index `i+1` which is now True, `found` is True, `n` is equal to `num`, `i` is the updated index after increment**
