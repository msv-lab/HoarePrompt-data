According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. After all iterations of the loop, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, and `found` is False does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, and `found` is False.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, `found` is False, `n` must be greater than 0**
