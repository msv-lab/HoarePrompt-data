Correctness: **True**

The annotated program accurately follows the problem description. It correctly reads three integers a, b, and c from input and then determines whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the problem description. 

If c is 0, it checks if a is equal to b and prints 'YES' in that case. If c is not 0, it checks if (b - a) is divisible by c and the division result is non-negative to print 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 

The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and behaves accordingly, making it correct.
