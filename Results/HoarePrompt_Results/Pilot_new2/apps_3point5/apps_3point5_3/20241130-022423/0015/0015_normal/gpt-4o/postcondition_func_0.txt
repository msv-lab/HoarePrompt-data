The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks if `b` is equal to `a`, in which case it prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a`, it further checks if `c` is equal to 0, printing 'NO' if true. If `c` is not 0, it verifies whether the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) holds true. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Therefore, the function essentially determines relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c` and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
