    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two integers a and b, where b is not equal to 0. It then calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original values of a and b by iteratively applying the Euclidean algorithm until b becomes 0. The function returns the GCD of the original values of a and b.

    p_no_shared = numerator
    p_total = denominator
    p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD
    A = p_shared
    B = p_total
    g = func_1(A, B)
    A //= g
    B //= g
    print(A % MOD, B % MOD)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers. The function calculates p_no_shared, p_total, and p_shared based on the provided formulas. Then, it calls a helper function `func_1` with A and B as parameters to calculate g. After obtaining the value of g, it updates A and B accordingly. Finally, the function prints the values of A % MOD and B % MOD. The code does not return anything explicitly, contrary to the annotation that indicates a return statement after shifting 1 left by n places. The functionality also lacks handling the case when k is greater than 1 << n.
