The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers. The constraints for `n` are 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and for `k` are 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the function returns the value of k after shifting 1 left by n places. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, where n is the number of places to shift 1 left, and k is the number to be shifted. The function then returns the value of k after shifting 1 left by n places.
