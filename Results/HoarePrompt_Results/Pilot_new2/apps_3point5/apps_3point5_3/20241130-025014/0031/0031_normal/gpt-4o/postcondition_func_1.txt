The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers. The function calculates p_no_shared, p_total, and p_shared based on the provided formulas. Then, it calls a helper function `func_1` with A and B as parameters to calculate g. After obtaining the value of g, it updates A and B accordingly. Finally, the function prints the values of A % MOD and B % MOD. The code does not return anything explicitly, contrary to the annotation that indicates a return statement after shifting 1 left by n places. The functionality also lacks handling the case when k is greater than 1 << n.
