Output State: **The program returns the remainder of numerator divided by (10^6 + 3) and the remainder of denominator divided by (10^6 + 3), where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, total_days = 2^n, numerator = ((2^n - (k-1)) * (2^n - (k-2)) * ... * 2), denominator = 2^(k*n), gcd is the greatest common divisor of numerator and denominator, and numerator //= gcd, denominator //= gcd.**
