Correctness: **True**

The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, as specified in the problem description. `func_1` calculates the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. `func_2` calculates the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a year of 2^n days.

The program correctly calculates the probability as an irreducible fraction A/B and prints the values modulo 10^6 + 3.

The program correctly handles cases where k is greater than 2^n by returning 1 1. It also correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday using the given formula.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
