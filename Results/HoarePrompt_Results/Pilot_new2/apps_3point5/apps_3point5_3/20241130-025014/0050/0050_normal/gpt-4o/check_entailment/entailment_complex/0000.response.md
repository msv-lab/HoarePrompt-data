Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price, and then determines whether to buy and sell stocks based on these prices. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it simply prints the initial amount of bourles held. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining bourles, and the total bourles after selling the shares, and then prints this total amount.

The program covers all cases as stated in the problem description and correctly outputs the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening.
