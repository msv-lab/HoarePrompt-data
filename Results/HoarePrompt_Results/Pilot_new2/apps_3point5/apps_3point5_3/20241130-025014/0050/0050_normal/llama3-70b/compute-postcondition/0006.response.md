According to the code, the loop will always execute since `n` is a constant integer value between 1 and 30. Before the loop starts, `shares` is 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers in descending order, `shares` is 0**.
