Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are integers. `n` and `m` are between 1 and 30. `r` is between 0 and the maximum value of `s`. `s` is a list of integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers in descending order. `shares` is an integer. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` for each element in `s`. Otherwise, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged.***
