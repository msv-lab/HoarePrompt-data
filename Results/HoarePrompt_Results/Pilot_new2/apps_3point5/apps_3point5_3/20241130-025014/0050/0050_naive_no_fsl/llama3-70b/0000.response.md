Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the opportunities to buy shares in the morning and calculates the maximum number of shares that can be purchased with the available bourles. Then, it iterates through the opportunities to sell shares in the evening and calculates the maximum number of bourles that can be obtained after selling the shares. The program considers all possible cases and handles them appropriately.
