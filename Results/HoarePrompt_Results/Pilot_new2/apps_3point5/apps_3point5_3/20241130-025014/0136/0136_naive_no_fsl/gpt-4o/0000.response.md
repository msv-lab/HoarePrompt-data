Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads two very long integers a and b from input and removes any leading zeroes.
2. It then compares the lengths of a and b, if they are not equal, it correctly determines which number is greater based on their lengths.
3. If the lengths are equal, it compares the actual values of a and b and correctly determines which number is greater.
4. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output ("<", ">", "=") as required.
