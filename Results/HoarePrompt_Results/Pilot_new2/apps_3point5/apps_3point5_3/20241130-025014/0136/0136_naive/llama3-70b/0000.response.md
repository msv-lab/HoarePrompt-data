Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads two very long integers a and b without leading zeroes.
2. It compares the integers a and b and prints the correct symbol "<", ">", or "=" based on the comparison.
3. The program uses lstrip('0') to remove any leading zeroes which ensures that the comparison is done accurately.
