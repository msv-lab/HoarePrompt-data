Correctness: **True**

The program reads two very long integers a and b as strings, strips any leading zeroes, and compares them based on their lengths. It then compares the actual values if the lengths are equal and prints the corresponding output ("<", ">", or "=") as described in the problem description. The program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and outputs the correct symbols.
