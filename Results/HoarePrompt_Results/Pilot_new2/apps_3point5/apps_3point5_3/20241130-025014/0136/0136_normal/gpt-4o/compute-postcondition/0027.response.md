Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, each with no more than 10^6 digits. It then compares the values of `a` and `b` based on their lengths and actual numerical values. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, it prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, it prints '>'. If the lengths are equal, it compares the numerical values of `a` and `b` and prints '<', '>', or '=' accordingly. The function does not return any value.**
