Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads two non-negative integers a and b as strings, removes any leading zeros, and compares them as required by the problem description. It then prints "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b. The program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all cases.
