Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are non-negative integers with no leading zeroes. If `a` is '0', `b` is '0'. If `b` is not '0', `a` is False in a boolean context. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, after the execution of the if else block, the length of `a` remains greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is not greater than the length of `b`, then after the execution of the if else block, `a` is either greater than `b` or less than or equal to `b`.***
