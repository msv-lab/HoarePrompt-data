Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of the input string after removing any leading zeros. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, the value of `b` will be the same as `a` if `a` has no leading zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is the input string after removing any leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is the input string after removing any leading zeros**
