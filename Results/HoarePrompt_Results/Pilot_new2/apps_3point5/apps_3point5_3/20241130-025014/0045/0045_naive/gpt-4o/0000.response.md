Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum sum of the sequence (min_sum) and checks if it is greater than the given number n. If it is greater, it returns -1, which is in line with the problem description.
If the minimum sum is less than or equal to n, the program proceeds to calculate the factor by which the sequence should be multiplied to get the sum n.
It then distributes the remainder, if any, among the sequence elements to maximize the greatest common divisor.
The program outputs the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise, it outputs -1.
The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where it does not work as expected.
