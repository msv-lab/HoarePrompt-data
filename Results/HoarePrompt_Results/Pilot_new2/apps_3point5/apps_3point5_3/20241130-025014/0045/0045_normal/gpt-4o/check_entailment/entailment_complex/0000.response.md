Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It first calculates the minimum sum required for a sequence of length k. If this minimum sum exceeds n, it returns -1 as expected. Otherwise, it calculates a sequence starting from d and incrementing by d for each subsequent element in the sequence. It then adjusts the sequence based on the remainder left after forming the initial sequence. Finally, it returns the generated sequence.

The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and adheres to the requirements outlined.
