Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two positive integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This function can be used within the main program to calculate the greatest common divisor of the resulting sequence of positive numbers.

Since the problem description requires finding a sequence of positive numbers whose sum is `n` and whose greatest common divisor is maximal, the provided function can be utilized to calculate the greatest common divisor efficiently. The program can then find the sequence accordingly. 

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description by utilizing the provided function to calculate the greatest common divisor of the resulting sequence.
