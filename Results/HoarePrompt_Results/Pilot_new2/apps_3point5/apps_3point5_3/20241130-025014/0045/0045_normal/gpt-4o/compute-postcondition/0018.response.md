According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i` and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is k - 2 and the value of sequence[i] has been increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of i should be decremented by 1. Also, if the remainder is 0, the program breaks out of the loop.
State: **Output State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is equal to k*(k+1)/2 and less than or equal to n; d is calculated as the floor division of n by min_sum; remainder is equal to n - d * min_sum - 2; sequence is a list containing elements d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd, i is initialized to k - 3 and the value of sequence[i] is increased by 1 if remainder is not 0**
