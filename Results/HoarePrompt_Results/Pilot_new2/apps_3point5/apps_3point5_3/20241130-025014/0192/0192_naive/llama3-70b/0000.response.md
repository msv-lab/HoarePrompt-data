Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers x and y as input and calculates the absolute difference between them, which gives us the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y. 
For all potential cases such that y < x and x, y satisfy 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required. There are no missing edge cases or logic errors in the program.
