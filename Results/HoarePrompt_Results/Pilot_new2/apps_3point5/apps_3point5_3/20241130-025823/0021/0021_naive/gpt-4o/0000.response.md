Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly finds the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculates the distances between them and the ends of the array. It then calculates the maximum possible distance that can be achieved by swapping the minimum and maximum elements. The logic is sound and accounts for all possible cases, ensuring that the maximum distance is correctly determined after exactly one swap. The program handles the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
