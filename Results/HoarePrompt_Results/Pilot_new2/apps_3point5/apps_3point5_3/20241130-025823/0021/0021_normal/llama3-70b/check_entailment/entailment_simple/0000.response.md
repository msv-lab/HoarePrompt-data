Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by calculating the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array, then determining the maximum possible distance between them by considering the distance of the current positions and the distance if a swap is made. The program then outputs the maximum possible distance as required. The logic in the program is correct and will always provide the correct output based on the problem description.
