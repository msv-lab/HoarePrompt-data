Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array, calculating the maximum possible distance between them after one swap, and then outputting the result. The logic for determining the maximum distance is also correctly implemented. For all the given examples, the program produces the expected output, ensuring that the minimum and maximum elements are as far apart as possible after one swap. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
