Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.
2. The func_1 function calculates the greatest common divisor of a list of integers, which is a necessary step to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
3. The func_2 function correctly calculates all the divisors of a given integer and returns them in reverse order, which is essential for finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
4. Both functions handle the specified constraints and requirements of the problem description.
5. The code annotations describe the states of the program accurately and do not introduce any potential cases not covered by the code.
6. The provided sample input and output also match the expected behavior of the program, demonstrating that it correctly solves the problem.
