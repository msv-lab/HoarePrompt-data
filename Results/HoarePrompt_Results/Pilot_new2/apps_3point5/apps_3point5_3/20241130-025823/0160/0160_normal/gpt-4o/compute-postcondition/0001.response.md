According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and the calculation `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The loop will execute as long as the result of `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` is greater than or equal to 1. Given the constraints, it can be guaranteed that the loop will execute with the initial state provided.

State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, divisors is an empty set**
