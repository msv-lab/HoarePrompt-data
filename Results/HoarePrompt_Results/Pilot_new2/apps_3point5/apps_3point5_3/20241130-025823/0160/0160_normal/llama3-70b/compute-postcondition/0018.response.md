According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `gcd`. If the current value of `i` is less than the value of `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` % `i` is 0 and `i` * `i` is not equal to `gcd`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, A is a list of integers based on the input split, gcd is equal to the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list A, max_divisor is updated to be equal to the maximum value between the previous max_divisor and gcd // i, and int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1 is greater than or equal to 1. The current value of gcd % i is 0. The current value of i * i is not equal to gcd. Adjust `i` to the next value greater than the current `i`.**
