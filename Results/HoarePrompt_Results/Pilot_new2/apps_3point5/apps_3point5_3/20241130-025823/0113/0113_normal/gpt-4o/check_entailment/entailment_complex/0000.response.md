Correctness: **True**

The provided program, func_1, correctly calculates the k-rounding of n based on the problem description. It calculates the value of x by multiplying n with 10 raised to the power of k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10 raised to the power of k, which is exactly what is required for the k-rounding operation. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct for all potential cases.
