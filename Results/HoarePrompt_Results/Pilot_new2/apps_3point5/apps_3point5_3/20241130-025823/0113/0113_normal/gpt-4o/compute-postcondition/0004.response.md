Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two positive integers n and k. It calculates the value of x by multiplying n with 10 raised to the power of k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10 raised to the power of k. The function then returns the calculated value of x. It is important to note that the function assumes valid input for n and k, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8.**
