According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is incremented by 1, `s` and `d` are assigned the values of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces**
