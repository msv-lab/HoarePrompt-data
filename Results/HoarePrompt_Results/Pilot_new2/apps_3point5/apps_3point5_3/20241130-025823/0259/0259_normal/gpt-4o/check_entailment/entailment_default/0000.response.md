Correctness: **True**

The code seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and a list of tuples representing each bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for each route based on Serval's time and returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time + 1. This aligns with the problem description where Serval will choose the bus route with the minimum wait time. 

The code iterates through each bus route, calculates the wait time based on Serval's time and the schedule of the buses, and keeps track of the minimum wait time and the chosen route. If the wait time is zero, it means Serval can catch the bus right away. If there are multiple routes with the same minimum wait time, the function returns the first encountered route, which is acceptable as mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the code is correct for all potential cases.
