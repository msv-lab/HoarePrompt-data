Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route based on Serval's time and returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time + 1. If there are multiple routes with the same minimum wait time, the function will choose the first encountered route, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
