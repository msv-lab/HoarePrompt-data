According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 1 tuple, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being greater than 0 ensures the loop can execute. The variables `_`, `min_time`, and `ans` do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted such that `buses` contains at least 1 tuple and `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are assigned the values from the first tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `_` is incremented by `n`, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0**
