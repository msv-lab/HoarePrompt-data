According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `buses` is an empty list, so it must remain as is. To ensure the loop executes, `n` should be greater than 0, and `_` should be incremented by 1 for each iteration.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration**
