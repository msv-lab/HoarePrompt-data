Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly rounds the input number to the nearest integer that ends with zero. It checks the remainder when dividing the number by 10 and then determines whether to round down or round up accordingly. The logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For example, for input 5, it correctly outputs 0. For input 113, it correctly outputs 110. It also handles cases where the input number already ends with zero, as shown in the provided examples. Hence, the program is correct for all potential cases.
