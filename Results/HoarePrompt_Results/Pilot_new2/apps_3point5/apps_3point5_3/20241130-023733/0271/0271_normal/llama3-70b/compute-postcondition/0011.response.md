Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer from the user input and performs different operations based on the value of the integer. If the integer is divisible by 10, it prints the integer itself. If the integer is not divisible by 10, it rounds the integer down to the nearest multiple of 10 if the last digit is less than or equal to 5, otherwise, it rounds the integer up to the nearest multiple of 10. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
