The function `func` reads an integer input `n`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, adjusts `n` to be either rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10 or rounded up. The adjusted value is then printed as the result. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases or missing functionality include handling negative inputs, as the current annotation only specifies non-negative integers and not covering the case where the remainder is exactly 5.
