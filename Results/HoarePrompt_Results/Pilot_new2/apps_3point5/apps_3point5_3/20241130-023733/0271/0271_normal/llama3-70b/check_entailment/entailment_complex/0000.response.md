Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer `n`, and based on the value of `n`, it rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n % 10 == 0`, it prints `n` since it is already rounded. If `n % 10 <= 5`, it rounds down by subtracting `n % 10`. If `n % 10 > 5`, it rounds up by adding `(10 - n % 10)`. This logic covers all cases as described in the problem description, making the program correct.
