Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly takes the input strings, iterates over the characters in the first string and appends only those characters that are present in the second string to a new string 'n'. It then appends the second string 't' to 'n' and returns the integer value of 'n'. This logic is in line with the problem description and will work for all potential cases. No case has been identified where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is True.
