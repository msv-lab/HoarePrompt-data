The function func_1 takes two parameters, `s` and `sub`, where `s` is a string of digits and `sub` is a substring of `s`. It then decrements the character counts in `s_counter` based on `sub_counter`. It generates possible numbers from the remaining characters in `remaining_chars`, using `sub`, and returns the smallest number among them.
