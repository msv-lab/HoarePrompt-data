The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. `chars` is a string representing a set of characters, and `sub` is also a string representing a subset of characters from the `chars` string. The function returns a list of all possible numbers that can be generated by combining the characters in the subset `sub`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `chars` and `sub`, where `chars` is a string of characters and `sub` is a subset of `chars`. It returns a list of all possible numbers that can be generated by combining the characters in the subset `sub`.**
