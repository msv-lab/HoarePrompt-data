Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It takes a string `s` and a substring `t`, then it constructs the smallest integer `n` by taking only the characters from `s` that are present in `t` (in an arbitrary order) and appends `t` to the end. This ensures that the resulting integer `n` contains all the characters of `t` as remembered by Vasya. The program then returns this integer `n` as required by the problem description.

The program is correct because it strictly follows the instructions provided in the problem description to find the smallest possible initial integer `n`.
