Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully follow the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to return the smallest possible initial integer `n` based on the provided input. However, the code does not handle the case where leading zeroes are present in the output. This means that the code does not consider the case where the integer `n` has leading zeroes except when `n` is equal to zero itself. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
