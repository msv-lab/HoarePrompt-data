Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It checks if there is a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights that matches the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. The program iterates through the list of Jedi Knights, updating the counts of each color and checking if the desired counts are met. If the counts are met, it returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'. The program handles all potential cases and correctly determines if an interval with the prescribed color counts exists.
