Postcondition: ***The function will return 'YES' only if all colors in `colors` have the same count as in `desired_counts`. `left` and `right` variables will have their final values based on the loop iterations. The `current_counts` dictionary must have the same count for each color as in `desired_counts`. There exists at least one color in `colors` where the count in `current_counts` is not the same as in `desired_counts`.***
