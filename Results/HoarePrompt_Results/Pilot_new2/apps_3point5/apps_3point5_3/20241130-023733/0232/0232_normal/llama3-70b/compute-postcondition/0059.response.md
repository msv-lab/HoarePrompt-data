Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `i` + 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and the current value of `i` is `i` + 1, `j` is equal to `i` + 1, `window_counts` is a dictionary with key `color` and value 1, `color` is the value of `colors[i+1]` and `color` is not in `window_counts`. Additionally, all the values in the `window_counts` dictionary are equal to the corresponding values in the `counts` list after sorting.***
