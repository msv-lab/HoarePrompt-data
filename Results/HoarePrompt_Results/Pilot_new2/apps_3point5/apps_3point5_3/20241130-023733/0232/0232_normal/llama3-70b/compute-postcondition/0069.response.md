Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to i+4, i is i+1, j is i+3, window_counts is a dictionary with key color and value 2, color is the value of colors[i+2], color is not in window_counts, all values in window_counts are equal to the corresponding values in the counts list after sorting, found is True, color is the value of colors[j]. If color is not in window_counts, then the value associated with key color in window_counts is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
