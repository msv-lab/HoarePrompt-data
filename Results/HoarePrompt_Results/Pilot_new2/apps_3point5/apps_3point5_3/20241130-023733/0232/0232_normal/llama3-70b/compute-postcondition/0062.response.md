Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to `i` + 3, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i` + 2, `window_counts` is a dictionary with key `color` and value 1, `color` is the value of `colors[i+1]`, `color` is not in `window_counts`, all values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in the `counts` list after sorting, `found` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
