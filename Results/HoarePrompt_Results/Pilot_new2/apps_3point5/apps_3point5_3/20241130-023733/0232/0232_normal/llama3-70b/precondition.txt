n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n. The colors of lightsabers of Jedi Knights are represented by integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. The desired counts of lightsabers for each color are positive integers such that the sum of all desired counts is between 1 and n, inclusive.**
