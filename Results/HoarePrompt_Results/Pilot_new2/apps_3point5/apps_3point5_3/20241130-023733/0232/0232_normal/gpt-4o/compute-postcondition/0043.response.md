According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the count of each color in `current_counts` is greater than or equal to the count of each color in `desired_counts`. Right before the loop, the conditions for all colors to have the same count as in `desired_counts` need to be ensured. Therefore, the `current_counts` dictionary must be adjusted to have the same count for each color as in `desired_counts`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The function will return 'YES' only if all colors in `colors` have the same count as in `desired_counts`. `left` and `right` variables will have their final values based on the loop iterations. The `current_counts` dictionary must have the same count for each color as in `desired_counts`**
