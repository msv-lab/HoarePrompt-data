Postcondition: ***Output State: After the loop executes, the function returns 'YES' if all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]`. Otherwise, there exists at least one color such that `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color`. `left` has been incremented until this condition is met. `n` and `m` are positive integers with 1 <= `m` <= `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `desired_counts` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `m`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int) with keys from 1 to `m`. `right` is incremented by 1. `current_counts[colors[right]]` has been incremented by 1. `current_counts[colors[right]]` must be greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[right]]`. Additionally, there exists at least one color such that `current_counts[color]` is not equal to `desired_counts[color]`.***
