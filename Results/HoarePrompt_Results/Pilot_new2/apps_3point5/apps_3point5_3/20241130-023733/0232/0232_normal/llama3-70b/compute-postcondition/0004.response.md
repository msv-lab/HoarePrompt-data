According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the colors list. If the list has at least 1 color, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, the colors list should have at least 1 color and the color is the first color in the list. Additionally, the color_counts dictionary is empty at the start.
State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 1 color, color is the first color in the list, counts is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, color_counts is an empty dictionary**
