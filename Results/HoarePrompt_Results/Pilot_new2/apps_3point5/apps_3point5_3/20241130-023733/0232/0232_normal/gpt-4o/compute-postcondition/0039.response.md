Output State: **`left` is incremented by 1. `right` is incremented by 3. `current_counts` for colors at `right` is decremented by 1. The counts of colors at `right` in `current_counts` are still greater than or equal to the counts in `desired_counts`. If all the color counts in `current_counts` match the counts in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES'.**
