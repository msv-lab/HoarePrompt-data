Postcondition: ***`left`, `right` are incremented by 2. `current_counts[colors[right]]`, `current_counts[colors[left]]` are both incremented by 2. If all colors in `desired_counts` have the same count as in `current_counts`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
