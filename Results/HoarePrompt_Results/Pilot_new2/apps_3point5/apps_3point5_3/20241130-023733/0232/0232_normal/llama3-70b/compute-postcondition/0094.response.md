Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `j` are integers. `n` is an integer greater than `i` + 4. `i` is incremented by 1. `j` is less than `n`. `window_counts` is populated based on sorted values in the `counts` list. `found` is True. `color` is the value of `colors[j]`. `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The condition where all counts in `window_counts.values()` are equal to corresponding targets in the `counts` list is satisfied. `found` remains True. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
