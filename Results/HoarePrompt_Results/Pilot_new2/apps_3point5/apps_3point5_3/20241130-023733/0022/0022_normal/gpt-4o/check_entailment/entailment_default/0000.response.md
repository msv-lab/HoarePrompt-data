Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes an input string `s` and checks if it is an "s-palindrome" by comparing the characters from the beginning and end of the string towards the center.
- The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the string to check if it is symmetric about the middle of the string.
- The code aligns with the problem description by determining if the input string is symmetric about the middle, which is the definition of an "s-palindrome".
- The code covers all potential cases described in the problem statement, as it accurately checks for the symmetry in the given string.
