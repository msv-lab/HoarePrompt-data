The function `func` reads an input string `s` consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It then iterates through the string to determine if it is a palindrome. If the string is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, it operates on the input string and prints the result based on whether the string is a palindrome or not.
