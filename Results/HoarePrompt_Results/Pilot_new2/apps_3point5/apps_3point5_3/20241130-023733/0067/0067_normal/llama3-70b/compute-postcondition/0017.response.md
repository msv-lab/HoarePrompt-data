Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the program prints '+'. If `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, then:
- If `x` < `y`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.
- If `x` == `y` and `z` == 0, `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is set to 0.
- If `x` == `y` and `z` != 0, `x` is equal to `y` and `z` remains unchanged.***
