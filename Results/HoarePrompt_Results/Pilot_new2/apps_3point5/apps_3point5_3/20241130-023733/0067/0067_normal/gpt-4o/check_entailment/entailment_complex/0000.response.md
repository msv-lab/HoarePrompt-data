Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z, calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values, and then determines the result as specified in the problem description. The program prints '-' if there are more downvotes than upvotes, prints '+' if there are more upvotes than downvotes, and prints '?' if the result is uncertain. The conditions in the program correctly capture the scenarios described in the problem description, making it a correct implementation.
