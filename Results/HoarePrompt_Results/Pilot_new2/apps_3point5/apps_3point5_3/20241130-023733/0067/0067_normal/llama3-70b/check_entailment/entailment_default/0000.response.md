Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

1. The program does not handle the case where `x > y` and `z > 0` correctly. In this situation, the result should be uncertain ('?') as there can be multiple possible results. However, the code incorrectly prints a definite result ('0').

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all the possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description.
