Postcondition: ***x, y, z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. x, y, z are assigned values parsed from input split by space. x is less than or equal to y + z, x is greater than or equal to y. In the current state, x is equal to y. Additionally, after entering the if condition, x is equal to y, z is equal to 0, and the current value of z is 0.***
