Postcondition: ***`d_index`, `d_queue`, `r_queue` are adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time. `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. If `d_index < r_index`, `d_queue` contains the result of `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` contains the value `r_index + n` appended at the end.***
