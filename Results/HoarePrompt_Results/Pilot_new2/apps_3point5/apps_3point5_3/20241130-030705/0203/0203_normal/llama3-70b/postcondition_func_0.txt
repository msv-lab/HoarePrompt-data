Functionality: The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string `fractions` representing the political affiliations of the employees as 'D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats. It then counts the number of depublicans and remocrats in the fractions. After that, it determines which political party has the majority based on the counts. If depublicans outnumber remocrats, it prints 'D'. If remocrats outnumber depublicans or if the counts are equal, it prints 'R'. This function does not handle the case where the counts are equal and does not print 'tie' as mentioned in the annotations.
