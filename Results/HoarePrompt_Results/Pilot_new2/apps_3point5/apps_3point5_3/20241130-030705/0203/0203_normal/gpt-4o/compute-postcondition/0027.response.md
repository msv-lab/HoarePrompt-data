According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `d_index` and `r_index` are values popped from the front of `d_queue` and `r_queue` respectively. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` contains the appended value of `(d_index + n)`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` contains the value of `r_index + n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` should not be empty and `r_queue` can be empty.
2. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` should not be empty and `d_queue` can be empty.

State: **`d_index` and `r_index` are values popped from the front of `d_queue` and `r_queue` respectively. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` contains the appended value of `(d_index + n)`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` contains the value of `r_index + n`.**
