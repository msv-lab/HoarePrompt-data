Output State: **After printing 'D', the state remains the same as initial state: either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be empty depending on the initial configuration of `votes`, `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' characters that were processed, `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters that were processed, `d_index` and `r_index` will be the last popped values from the respective queues, and if `(d_queue)` is true, then `d_queue` is not empty and has elements to process.**
