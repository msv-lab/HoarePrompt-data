Postcondition: ***If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` contains the appended value of `(d_index + n)` and `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the 0th index of `r_queue`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` contains the value of `r_index + n` and `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the 0th index of `r_queue`. Additionally, if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` contains the appended value of `(d_index + n)`. Otherwise, `r_queue` contains the value of `r_index + n` and `r_queue` appends the value of `r_index + n`.***
