Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string with at least one fraction, `republicans` and `remocrats` are both integers. If the condition (fraction == 'D') is true, then `fraction` is 'D' and `republicans` is increased by 1. If the condition (fraction == 'D') is false, then `remocrats` is increased by 1.***
