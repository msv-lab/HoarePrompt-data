The function `func` accepts no parameters. The positive integer `n` represents the number of employees, and each employee belongs to either 'D' (depublicans) or 'R' (remocrats). The function will return the majority party among the employees based on the count of 'D' and 'R'. If there are an equal number of 'D' and 'R' employees, it will return "Tie". Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to determine the majority party among the employees and handle a tie scenario.
Functionality: **The function counts the number of 'D' and 'R' employees and returns the majority party. If there is a tie, it returns "Tie".**
