Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, counts the number of depublicans and remocrats, and then determines the outcome of the vote based on the comparison of the two fractions. The logic follows the problem description accurately, and for every potential case or input, the program is able to predict the outcome of the vote correctly. There are no scenarios provided in the problem description where the program fails to meet the requirements.
