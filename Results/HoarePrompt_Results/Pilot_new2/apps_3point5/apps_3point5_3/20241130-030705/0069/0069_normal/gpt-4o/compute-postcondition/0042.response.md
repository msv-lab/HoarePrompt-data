Output State: **$T$ remains the first integer value from the `data` list, `n` is equal to the first element of the `data` list, `x` is assigned the integer value `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` remains a binary string of length $n, `data` remains a list containing input values and is not empty, `index` is 5. If `balance` is equal to 0, the program variables remain the same. If `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list, `results` will contain -1. If `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` list, `results` will contain 0. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` will be the number of times the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0` is satisfied for all elements in the list `prefix_balances` and the value will be appended to the list `results`.**
