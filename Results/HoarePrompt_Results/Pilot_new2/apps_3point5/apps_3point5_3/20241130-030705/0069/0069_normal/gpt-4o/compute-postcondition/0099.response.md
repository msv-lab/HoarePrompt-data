Output State: **`T` is `T - n`, where `n` is an integer equal to `data[8]`. `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`. `s` is a string value equal to `data[index + 2]`. `index` is increased by 3. `balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, and it is not equal to 0. `prefix_balances` is a list where each element `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the sum of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '0', and -1 otherwise. `count` is assigned the value 1. The current value of `balance` is not equal to 0. The current value of `prefix_balances` list must have at least one element.**
