Output State: **$T$ remains the first integer value from the data list, `n` is the total number of iterations of the loop, `x` is assigned the integer value `int(data[8 + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[8 + 2]`, `data` remains a list containing input values and is not empty, `index` is now 8, `balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `results` will contain -1 if `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list and 0 if `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` list, `prefix_balances` is a list with n+1 elements where `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated as the sum of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and 1 if `s[i - 1]` is equal to '0' otherwise subtract 1, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is initialized to 0**
