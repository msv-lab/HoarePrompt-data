Postcondition: ***T is an integer input with T greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `x` are integers obtained from splitting the input, `s` is a string obtained from input, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `balance` is equal to cnt0 - cnt1. The balance is not equal to x. The current value of x - balance is a multiple of cnt0 - cnt1***
