Postcondition: ***$T$ remains the first integer value from the data list, `n` is the total number of iterations of the loop, `x` is assigned the integer value `int(data[8 + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[8 + 2]`, `data` remains a list containing input values and is not empty, `index` is now 8, `balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `results` will contain -1 if `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list and 0 if `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` list, `count` will be the number of times the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0` is satisfied for all elements in the list `prefix_balances`, the count value will be appended to the list `results`, `prefix_balances` is a list with n+1 elements where `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated as the sum of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and 1 if `s[i - 1]` is equal to '0' otherwise subtract 1. If `balance` is equal to 0, the current state of the program is such that the balance is zero. After the execution of the if else block, the value of `x` either remains in the `prefix_balances` list with results containing -1 or `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` list with results containing an additional element with the value 0.***
