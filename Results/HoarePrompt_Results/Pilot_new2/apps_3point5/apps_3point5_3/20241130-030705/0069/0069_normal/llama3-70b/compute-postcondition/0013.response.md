Postcondition: ***T, n, x are integers obtained from splitting the input, s is a string obtained from input, cnt0 is the count of '0's in the string s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in the string s, balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1, and balance is not equal to x. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) == 0, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part where the value printed is equal to ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1).***
