Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code iterates over each test case and calculates the balance of 0's and 1's in the given string 's'. It then checks three conditions based on the balance and the desired balance 'x':
1. If the balance equals 'x', it prints 'n + 1', which represents the number of prefixes of 't' with balance equal to 'x'.
2. If the condition `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` is met, it prints -1, indicating an infinite number of prefixes.
3. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the number of prefixes based on the formula `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.

The code logic aligns with the problem description and it handles the cases as described. The output hints also match the code functionality, further confirming that the code is correct.
