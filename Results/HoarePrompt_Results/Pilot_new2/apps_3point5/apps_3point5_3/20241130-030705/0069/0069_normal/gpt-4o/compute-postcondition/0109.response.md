Postcondition: ***Output State: `T` is now `T - n`, `n` is an integer equal to `data[8]`, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is a string value equal to `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `prefix_balances` list has been updated based on the conditions mentioned. If `balance` is 0, then `results` appends -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise `prefix_balances` is modified, `x` is updated, and `results` appends 0. If `balance` is not 0, `T` is now `T - n - count * n`, `n`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remain the same as before, `balance` is not zero, `prefix_balances` has at least `count` more elements, `count` is the total number of iterations where a specific condition is satisfied, and `results` has `count` appended to it.***
