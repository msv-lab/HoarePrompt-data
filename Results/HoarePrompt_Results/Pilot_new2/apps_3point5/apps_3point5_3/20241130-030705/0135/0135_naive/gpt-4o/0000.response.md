Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if all the remainders of division of n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder, and checks if it has been seen before. If a remainder is already in the set of seen remainders, it immediately returns 'No', indicating that the remainders are not distinct. If all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and for all potential cases, it correctly determines whether the remainders are distinct or not.
