Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen` is a set containing values of `n` modulo `i` where 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n` and `remainder` is equal to `n` modulo `i`; `k` must be greater than or equal to 1; the next `i` value should be less than or equal to `k` and the `seen` set should be updated with the new `remainder` value if it's not already present, `remainder` is equal to n modulo i after the code execution.**
