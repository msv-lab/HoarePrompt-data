Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It first sorts the input sequence `a`, then iterates through the sorted sequence to determine if each element can be obtained by doubling the previous element. If not, it increments the count of variables `m`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
