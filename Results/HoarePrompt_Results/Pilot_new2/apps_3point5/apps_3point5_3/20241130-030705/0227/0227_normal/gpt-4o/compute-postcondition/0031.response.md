According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the values of the variables `assigned` and `can_form`. If there is still an element remaining in the `assigned` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is False and `assigned` is a non-empty list. For the loop to execute one more time, there should still be elements remaining in the `assigned` list.
State: **`can_form` is False, `assigned` is a non-empty list**
