Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the list of integers, checking if a pair exists where their difference is also in the list. It keeps track of the count of pairs that don't meet the condition and returns the total count. This aligns with the requirement of finding the minimum number of variables needed to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem description. The program also handles the case where it cannot perform the sequence of operations by returning -1.
