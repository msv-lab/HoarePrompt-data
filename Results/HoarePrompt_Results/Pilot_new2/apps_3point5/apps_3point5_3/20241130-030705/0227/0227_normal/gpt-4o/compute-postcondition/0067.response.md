Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` in the range [1, 23] and a list `a` of distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list `a`, iterates through the elements to check if a pair exists where their difference is also in the list, and increments a counter `m` for each pair that doesn't meet the condition. Finally, it returns the total count of pairs that didn't meet the condition. **
