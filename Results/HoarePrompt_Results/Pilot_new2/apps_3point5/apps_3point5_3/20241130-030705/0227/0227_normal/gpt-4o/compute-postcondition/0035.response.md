According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the assigned list. If there are still elements in the assigned list that have not been iterated over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is False, assigned is a non-empty list. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must still be elements in the assigned list that have not been iterated over.
State: **`can_form` is False, `assigned` is a non-empty list with elements remaining to be iterated over**
