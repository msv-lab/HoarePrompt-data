Output State: **If there exists a pair of elements in the list `a` such that their difference is also in the list `a`, then `can_form` is True. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False after the loop executes. The current value of `can_form` is True if the condition is met, otherwise it remains False. `assigned` contains the elements of list `a` up to index `i`.**
