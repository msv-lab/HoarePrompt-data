Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
- It calculates the time taken to move between two points based on the floors and blocks they are located on.
- The minimum block time is computed by finding the minimum distance between the blocks multiplied by 15.
- The minimum floor time is calculated based on the difference between the floors multiplied by 5 with an additional fixed time of 10.
- Finally, the total time taken for the movement is printed.
- The code handles the scenario where Edward and Natasha are on different floors and blocks within the building.
- The logic of using the minimum distance between blocks and the difference in floors to calculate the minimum time is sound.
- The code provides the correct output based on the given problem description and examples.
