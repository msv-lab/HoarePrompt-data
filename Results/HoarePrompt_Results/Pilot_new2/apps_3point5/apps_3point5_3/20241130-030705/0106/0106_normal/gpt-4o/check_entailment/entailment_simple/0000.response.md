Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines two functions. The `get_location` function correctly calculates the block and floor numbers for a given apartment number based on the problem description. 

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the total time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given conditions in the problem description. It handles the case where Edward is already on the first floor, calculates the time to exit his building, determines the minimum time to walk around the circular building in either direction, and calculates the time to reach Natasha's floor. The final calculation of the total time is done accurately.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
