The function `func` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. It filters the `student_data` dictionary based on the condition that the student's height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The function then returns a new dictionary containing only the students that meet these criteria.
