Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code snippet provided defines a function `all_Characters_Same` that takes a string `s` as input and returns True if all characters in the string `s` are the same, otherwise it returns False. The code achieves this by converting the string into a set and comparing the length of the set to 1. If all characters are the same, the set will have a length of 1, and the function will return True. This logic is consistent with the problem description, and there are no edge cases where the code might fail to produce the correct output. 

Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the correctness of the code is True.
