Example Answer:
The value of `first_char` is assigned the first character of string `s`. If `s` is empty, accessing `s[0]` will result in an error, so the function returns True. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string and the function returns True.
Output State: **`s` is a string and the function returns True**
