Example Answer:
The function returns `False`. The state of the variables `s` and `char` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the last character in `s`, and the function returns False.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the last character in `s`, and the function returns False**
