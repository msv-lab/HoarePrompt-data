According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst` - 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 2**
