Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements. It iterates through the list, comparing each element with the next. If at any point an element is greater than the one following it, the function returns False. If the list has less than 2 elements, the function returns True. However, the annotations suggest that the function always returns True, which is not accurate. The actual functionality is to return False if any element in the list is greater than the one following it, and True otherwise.**
