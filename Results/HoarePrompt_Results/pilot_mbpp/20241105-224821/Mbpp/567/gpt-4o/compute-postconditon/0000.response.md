According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lst`. If the length of the list is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `lst` is a list of comparable elements does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2 and `i` starts at 0.
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 0**
