Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description. The function `issort_list` accepts a list `lst` of elements and returns True if the elements are in non-decreasing order, which is exactly what the problem description specifies. The code uses a list comprehension and the `all()` function to check if each element in the list is less than or equal to the next element, ensuring that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The code does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains non-comparable elements, but the problem description does not specify that such cases need to be handled. Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
