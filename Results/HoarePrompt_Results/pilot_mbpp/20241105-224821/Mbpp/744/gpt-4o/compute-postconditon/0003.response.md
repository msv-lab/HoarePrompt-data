According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tup`. If `tup` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` contains at least 1 element. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `tup` must contain at least 2 elements.
State: **`tup` contains at least 2 elements**
