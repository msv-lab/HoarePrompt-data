Example Answer: 
The function returns `True`, and there are no changes to the initial state variables. Therefore, the output state is `tup` contains at least 3 elements, `item` is the next element in `tup` to be iterated over, and the function returns True.
Output State: **`tup` contains at least 3 elements, `item` is the next element in `tup` to be iterated over, and the function returns True**
