Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided in the program correctly follows the problem description. The function `check_none` accepts a tuple `tup` and iterates through each element in the tuple. If the element is None, it returns True immediately. If no None elements are found after iterating through the entire tuple, it returns False. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the function should return True if the tuple is not empty and contains at least one None element, otherwise it should return False.

Additionally, all the provided test cases pass successfully, further confirming that the code is correctly implemented to check for the presence of None values in the tuple.
