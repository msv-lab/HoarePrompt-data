Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. It calculates the even_count and odd_count correctly and then uses these counts to calculate the number of pairs that XOR to an even number. The test cases provided also pass successfully, covering different scenarios. Therefore, the function is correct.
