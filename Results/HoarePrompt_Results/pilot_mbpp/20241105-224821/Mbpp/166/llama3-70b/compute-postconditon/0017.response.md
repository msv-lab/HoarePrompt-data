According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 3 elements. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `len(nums)`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `j` is less than `len(nums)`**
