Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. `i` is incremented by 1. `j` is equal to the new value of `i + 1`. `j` is less than the length of `nums`. XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even. If the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is increased by 1.***
