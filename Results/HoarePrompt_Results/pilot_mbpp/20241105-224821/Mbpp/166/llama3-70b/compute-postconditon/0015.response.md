Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is known to have been updated for even XOR pairs. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` has been updated for even XOR pairs, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1, `count` is further incremented by 1.
Output State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` has been updated for even XOR pairs, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1, `count` is further incremented by 1**
