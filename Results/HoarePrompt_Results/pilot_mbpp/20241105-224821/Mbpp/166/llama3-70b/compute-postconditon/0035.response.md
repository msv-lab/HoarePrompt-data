According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is incremented by 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums` and `i` should be less than the length of `nums` minus 1.
State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements. If the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, `count` is increased by 1. `i` is still less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is incremented by 2. `j` is less than the length of `nums`.**
