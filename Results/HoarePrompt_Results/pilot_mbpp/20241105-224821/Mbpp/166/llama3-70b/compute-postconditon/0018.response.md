Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` has at least 3 elements, `j` is less than `len(nums)`, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `j` is less than `len(nums)`, `count` is increased by 1**
