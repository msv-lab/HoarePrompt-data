According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the new value of `i + 1`, and XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the new value of `i + 2`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. `i` is incremented by 1. `j` is equal to the new value of `i + 2`. XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even. If the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is increased by 1.**
