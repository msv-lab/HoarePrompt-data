DEBUG - description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
DEBUG - Postcondition: The function `func` accepts a list `arr` and an element `elem`. It iterates through the list `arr` and if it finds an element equal to `elem`, it returns True along with the index of that element. If no such element is found in the list, the function returns False and -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to search for the presence of a specific element in the list and return True with the index if found, or False and -1 if not found.

DEBUG - description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
DEBUG - Postcondition: Functionality: The function `func` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a single element to be compared within the list. The function searches for the `element` in the `arr`. If the `element` is found in the `arr`, the function returns True along with the index where the element is located. If the `element` is not found in the `arr`, the function returns False. If the `arr` is empty, the function also returns False. If the `element` is not found in a non-empty `arr`, the function should return False.

DEBUG - Postcondition: Functionality: The function func accepts a string `s` and a single character `c`. If both the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` and the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` are not -1, the function returns the modified string after removing the substring between the first and last occurrences inclusive. If either the index of the first occurrence or the index of the last occurrence of `c` is -1, the function returns the original string `s`.

DEBUG - Postcondition: The function `func` accepts two parameters `s` and `ch`, where `s` is a string and `ch` is a string of length 1. If `first_index` is -1 or `last_index` is -1 or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, then the function returns `s`. Otherwise, it removes the character at the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s` and returns the modified string.

DEBUG - Postcondition: The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, iterates through each sublist, calculates the length of the longest sublist, and returns that length. If the input list is empty, it returns 0. The function accurately determines the length of the longest sublist regardless of the initial value of `max_length` mentioned in the annotations.

DEBUG - description: Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
DEBUG - Postcondition: Functionality: The function accepts two parameters, a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It calculates the parity of the count of '1's in substrings of length equal to the length of `s`. If `n` is 0 or negative, or if the length of `s` is 0, the function returns 0. The function then returns the final value of `count` which represents the parity count of '1's. However, there is missing functionality in the code as it doesn't handle cases where the length of the binary string `s` is less than `n`. This missing logic could potentially lead to unexpected results.

DEBUG - Postcondition: The function `func` accepts two parameters: `binary_str`, which is a binary string, and `num_rotations`, a non-negative integer. It rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times, calculates the decimal representation of the final rotated binary string, and counts the number of times this decimal value is odd. The function then returns this count. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the count remains 0.
