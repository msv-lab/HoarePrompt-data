Example Answer:
The `binary_str` is converted to an integer value using `int(binary_str, 2)`. The value of `integer_value` is now the decimal representation of the binary string. The other variables remain the same unless there is specific information provided about them. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the updated rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is the same, `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the `integer_value` after rotation, `integer_value` is the decimal representation of `binary_str`.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the updated rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is the same, `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the `integer_value` after rotation, `integer_value` is the decimal representation of `binary_str`**
