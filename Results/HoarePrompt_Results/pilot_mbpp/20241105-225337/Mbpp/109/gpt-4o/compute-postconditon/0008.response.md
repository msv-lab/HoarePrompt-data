Example Answer:
The variable `integer_value` is assigned the integer value of `binary_str` interpreted as a binary number. The value of `binary_str` is the rotated binary string, so the integer value will be based on that string. The variables `num_rotations` and `count` are not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`**
