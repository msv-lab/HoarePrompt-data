The function `func` accepts two parameters: `binary_str`, which is a binary string, and `num_rotations`, a non-negative integer. It rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times, calculates the decimal representation of the final rotated binary string, and counts the number of times this decimal value is odd. The function then returns this count. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the count remains 0.
