The function `func` accepts two parameters, `s` and `n`. **Precondition**: `s` is a binary string, and `n` is a non-negative integer. The loop inside the function calculates the parity of the count of '1's in substrings of length equal to the length of the binary string `s`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and the `count` remains 0. If the length of `s` is 0, the loop does not execute and the `count` remains 0. The function returns the final value of `count`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and calculates the parity of the count of '1's in substrings of length equal to the length of `s`. If `n` is 0 or negative, or if the length of `s` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the final value of `count`.**
