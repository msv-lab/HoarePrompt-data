Example Answer:
The value of `count` is updated by adding the count of '1's in the `temp` string modulo 2. The previous values of variables are `s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the count of '1' in `temp` string modulo 2, `i` is 1, `temp` is a substring of `s` starting from index 1 and ending at the length of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the count of '1' in `temp` string modulo 2, `i` is 1, `temp` is a substring of `s` starting from index 1 and ending at the length of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the count of '1' in `temp` string modulo 2, `i` is 1, `temp` is a substring of `s` starting from index 1 and ending at the length of `s`**
