The function `func` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`. `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers with the same length, and `list2` does not contain any zero elements. After executing the function body, the function returns a new list containing the division of each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two lists of numbers `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list containing the division of each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers, list1 and list2, where list2 does not contain any zero elements. It returns a new list containing the division of each element in list1 by the corresponding element in list2.**
