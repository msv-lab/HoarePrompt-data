Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers, list1 and list2. It then returns a new list containing the division of each element in list1 by the corresponding element in list2. It is assumed that list2 does not contain any zero elements.** 

Edge cases and missing functionality: The current code does not handle the case when list2 contains zero elements. If list2 contains a zero element, it would result in a division by zero error. This case needs to be addressed to ensure the function handles all possible scenarios.
