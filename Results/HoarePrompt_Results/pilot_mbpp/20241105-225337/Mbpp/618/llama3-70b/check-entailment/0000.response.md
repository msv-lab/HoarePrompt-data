Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `div_list` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, of the same length. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, a `ValueError` is raised as mentioned in the problem description. Otherwise, it returns a new list containing the result of element-wise division of corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`. The code handles the division of two lists element-wise as required. Since the code aligns with the problem description and there are no specific edge cases mentioned that are not handled, the correctness is determined as True.
