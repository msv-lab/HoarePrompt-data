Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program divides two lists element-wise only if both lists are of the same length. It correctly raises a ValueError if the lengths of the two lists are not equal. The zip function is used to iterate over both lists simultaneously, ensuring that the division is performed between corresponding elements. There are no cases identified where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
