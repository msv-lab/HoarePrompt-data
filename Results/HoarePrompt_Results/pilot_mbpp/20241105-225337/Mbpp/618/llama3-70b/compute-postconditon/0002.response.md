Example Answer:
The code calculates the division of each pair of elements from list1 and list2 using list comprehension. If there is a division by zero, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError. The lists list1 and list2 remain unchanged and are still lists of the same length. 
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists of the same length**
