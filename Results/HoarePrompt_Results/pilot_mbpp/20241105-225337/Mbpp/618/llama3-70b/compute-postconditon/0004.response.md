Functionality: **The function func accepts two lists, list1 and list2, of the same length. If the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal, a ValueError is raised stating that both lists must be of the same length. Otherwise, it returns a new list containing the result of element-wise division of corresponding elements from list1 and list2.**
