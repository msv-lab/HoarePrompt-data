Example Answer: 
The function returns the string `s`. The variables `s`, `c`, `first_occ`, and `last_occ` are not affected by the return statement. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string, c is a single character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is either the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1.
Output State: **s is a string, c is a single character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is either the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1**
