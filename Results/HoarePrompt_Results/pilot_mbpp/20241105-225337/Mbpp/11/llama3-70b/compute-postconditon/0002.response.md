Example Answer: 
The code concatenates three parts of the string `s`. The first part is from index 0 to `first_occ - 1`, the second part is from `first_occ + 1` to `last_occ - 1`, and the third part is from `last_occ + 1` to the end of the string. Depending on the values of `first_occ` and `last_occ`, the resulting string may vary. If `first_occ` and `last_occ` are both -1, it means the character `c` was not found in `s`, so the resulting string will be the same as `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `c` is a single character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is either the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, and the function returns the modified string.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a single character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is either the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, and the function returns the modified string**
