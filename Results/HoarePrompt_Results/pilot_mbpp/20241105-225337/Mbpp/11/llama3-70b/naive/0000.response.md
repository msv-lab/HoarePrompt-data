Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. 

For example, if the input string is "hello" and the character to remove is "l", the program will return "helo" instead of "heo". 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
