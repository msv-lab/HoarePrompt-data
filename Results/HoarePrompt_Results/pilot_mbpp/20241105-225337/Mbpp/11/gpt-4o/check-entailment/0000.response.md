Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `remove_Occ` accepts two parameters `s` and `ch`, where `s` is a string and `ch` is a string of length 1.
- If `first_index` is -1 (indicating that the character `ch` is not found in the string), or `last_index` is -1 (indicating the same), or if `first_index` is equal to `last_index` (indicating that there is only one occurrence of `ch`), then the function correctly returns the input string `s` without any removal needed.
- In all other cases, the function correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the character `ch` from the string `s` by slicing the string accordingly and returns the modified string.
- The provided test cases also pass, confirming the correctness of the function for the given cases.
