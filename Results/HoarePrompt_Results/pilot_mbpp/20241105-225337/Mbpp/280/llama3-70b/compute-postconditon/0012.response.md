The function `func` accepts two parameters: a list `arr` and an element `elem` of any data type. 

Case_1: If the list `arr` contains at least one element equal to `elem`, the function will return True along with the index of that element. 

Case_2: If no element in the list `arr` is equal to `elem`, the function will return False and -1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `elem`, and return True along with the index of the element if it is found in the list. If the element is not found, the function returns False and -1.
