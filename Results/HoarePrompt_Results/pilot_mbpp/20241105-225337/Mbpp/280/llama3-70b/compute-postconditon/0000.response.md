According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the beginning of the loop, arr is a list and elem is any data type. So, for the loop to execute, arr must have at least 1 element, and i is 0 and x is the first element in the list arr.
State: **`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `elem` is any data type, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list arr**
