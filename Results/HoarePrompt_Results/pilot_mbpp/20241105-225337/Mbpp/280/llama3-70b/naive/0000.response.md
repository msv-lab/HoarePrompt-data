Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program iterates through the array using enumerate to keep track of the index. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index position. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the program correctly handles the case when the element is not found by returning (False, -1).
