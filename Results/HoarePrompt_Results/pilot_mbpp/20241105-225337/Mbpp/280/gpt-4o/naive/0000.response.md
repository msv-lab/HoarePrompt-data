Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program defines a function `sequential_search` that takes in an array and an element to search for. It then iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value at that index. If the value matches the element being searched for, it returns a tuple with True and the index. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The test cases provided cover scenarios where the element is present at the beginning, middle, and end of the array, ensuring that the function works correctly in all cases. Since the program follows the problem description and passes all the test cases, the correctness is True.
