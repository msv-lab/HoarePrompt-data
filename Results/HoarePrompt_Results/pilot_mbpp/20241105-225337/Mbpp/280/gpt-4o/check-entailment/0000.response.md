Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `sequential_search` that takes in a list `arr` and an element `element`, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). 

The function iterates through the list using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value at that index. If the value matches the element, it returns a tuple with True and the index. If the element is not found in the list, it returns a tuple with False and -1.

The code seems to be following the problem description accurately for every potential case. The output hints also align with the code logic. The function correctly handles the scenario where the element is found at different positions in the array and returns the expected output tuple.
