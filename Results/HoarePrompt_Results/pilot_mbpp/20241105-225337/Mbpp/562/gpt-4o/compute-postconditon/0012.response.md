Example Answer: 
If `list_of_lists` is not empty, the loop will update `max_length` to the length of the longest sublist in the list. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `max_length` will remain 0. The function then returns the value of `max_length`, which will be the length of the longest sublist if `list_of_lists` is not empty, or 0 if `list_of_lists` is empty.
Output State: **If `list_of_lists` is not empty, `max_length` is the length of the longest sublist; if `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_length` is 0. The function returns the value of `max_length`.**
