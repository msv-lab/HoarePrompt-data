Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the list of sublists. It iterates through each sublist in the input list and calculates the length of each sublist. Then, it returns the maximum length among all the sublists. This logic aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
