Example Answer: 
The code returns the sorted list of elements that are present in either list1 or list2 but not both. The set function is used to convert the lists into sets to find the symmetric difference between them. The sorted function then sorts the resulting list. The values of list1 and list2 are not changed by the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: list1 and list2 are lists, and the function returns a sorted list of elements that are either in list1 or list2 but not both.
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists, and the function returns a sorted list of elements that are either in list1 or list2 but not both**
