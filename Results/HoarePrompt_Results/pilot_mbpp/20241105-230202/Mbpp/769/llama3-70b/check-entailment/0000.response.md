Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to accurately follow the problem description. The function `Diff` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements that are either in `list1` or `list2` but not both. It achieves this by using the XOR operator (^) on the sets created from `list1` and `list2`. The code also correctly handles cases where `list1` or `list2` is empty. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it is correctly implementing the desired functionality. Since we cannot think of any edge cases where the code might not work as expected, we can conclude that the code is correct.
