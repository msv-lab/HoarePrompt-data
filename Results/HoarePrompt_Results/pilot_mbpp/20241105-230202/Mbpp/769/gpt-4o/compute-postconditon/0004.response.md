Example Answer:
The `result_list` is sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`. The sorting is done in ascending order. The previous values of the affected variables are `list1`, `list2`, `set1`, `set2`, `diff_elements`. After sorting, the `result_list` will be rearranged accordingly.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of elements; `set1` is a set created from `list1`; `set2` is a set created from `list2`; `diff_elements` contains elements that are in one set but not in both; `result_list` is a list of elements present in `diff_elements` sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`**
