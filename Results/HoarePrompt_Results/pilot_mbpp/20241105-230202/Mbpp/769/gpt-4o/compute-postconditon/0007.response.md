Functionality: **The function func takes two parameters, list1 and list2, which are lists of elements. It then creates sets from these input lists, identifies elements that are present in only one set but not in both, and returns a list of these elements sorted by their index in the concatenated input lists. The function correctly implements the logic described in the annotations, considering all potential cases where elements may be missing or duplicated in the input lists.**
