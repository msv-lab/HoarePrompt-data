Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a string as input and uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces with '%20'. This implementation correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, as it replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20' without any issues. Therefore, the program is correct.
