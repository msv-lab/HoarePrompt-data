Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple containing elements with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `tup`. If the first element of `tup` is a tuple, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
