According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the tuple `tup` contains at least one element. 
Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to set `tup` to contain at least one element, and `elem` to be the first element of the tuple. 
State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least one element, `elem` is the first element of the tuple**
