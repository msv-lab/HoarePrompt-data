Postcondition: ***`nested_list` has more than 1 element, `element` is the next element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list; otherwise, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list` with additional elements added by `func(element)` if applicable. The overall state of the program after the if-else block execution incorporates all edge cases, ensuring that for each element in `nested_list`, if it is a list, its elements processed by `func` are added to `flat_list`, and if it is not a list, the element itself is appended to `flat_list`.***
