According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `flat_list` is empty. So, for the loop to execute, the `nested_list` must have at least 1 element, and `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`.
State: **`nested_list` has at least 1 element, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` is an empty list**
