According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `nested_list` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has more than 1 element, `element` is the new next element in `nested_list`, and `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list; otherwise, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list` with additional elements added by `func(element)` if applicable.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `element` in `nested_list` needs to be considered. If the next `element` is a list, the elements returned by `func(element)` should be appended to `flat_list`. If the next `element` is not a list, the `element` itself should be appended to `flat_list`.

State: **`nested_list` has more than 1 element, `element` is the new next element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list; otherwise, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list` with additional elements added by `func(element)` if applicable.**
