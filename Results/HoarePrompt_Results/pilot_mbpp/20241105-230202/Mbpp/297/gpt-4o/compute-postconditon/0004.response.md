Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 1 item, `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the first item in `nested_list` if the first item is a list. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains the first item from `nested_list`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios where `nested_list` contains at least 1 item and handles both cases where the first item is a list or not.***
