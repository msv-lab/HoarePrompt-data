According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list` and the current `item` being processed. The loop will iterate through each item in `nested_list`. At the end of the previous iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 2 items. `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the second item in `nested_list` if it is a list, otherwise `flat_list` contains the second item from `nested_list`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next `item` in `nested_list` needs to be considered. If there are more items in `nested_list` to iterate through, the loop will execute again.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 2 items, `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the next item in `nested_list` if it is a list, otherwise `flat_list` contains the next item from `nested_list`.**
