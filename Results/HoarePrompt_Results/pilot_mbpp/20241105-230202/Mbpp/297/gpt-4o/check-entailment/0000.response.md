Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `flatten_list` that takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list by recursively applying the function to each nested list. The function correctly handles nested lists by checking if the current item is a list using `isinstance(item, list)` and recursively calling `flatten_list` on that item. It then appends non-list items directly to the `flat_list`. The function returns the flattened list as expected.

Additionally, the provided test cases validate the correctness of the function by comparing the output of the function with the expected flattened lists. The function successfully flattens the nested lists in all the test cases provided without any issues, confirming that it meets the problem description.
