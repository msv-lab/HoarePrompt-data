Example Answer: 
`second_elements` is assigned a list comprehension that extracts the second element from each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The `list_of_lists` contains sublists with exactly two elements. Therefore, `second_elements` will contain all the second elements from the sublists in `list_of_lists`. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing the first elements of each sublist; second_elements is a list containing the second elements of each sublist**
