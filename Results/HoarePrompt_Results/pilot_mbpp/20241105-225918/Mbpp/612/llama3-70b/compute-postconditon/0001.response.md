The function `func` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. The function returns two new lists: the first list contains the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to extract and return the first and second elements of each sublist in the input `list_of_lists` as two separate lists. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, a list of lists with exactly two elements in each sublist, and returns two new lists containing the first and second elements of each sublist respectively.**
