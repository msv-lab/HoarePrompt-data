Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle complex numbers properly. The `convert` function is only accepting integers as input and not complex numbers as specified in the problem description. Therefore, it fails to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. 

Example:
```
assert convert(1+2j) == (2.23606797749979, 1.1071487177940904)
```

Since the program does not handle complex numbers as input, it will fail for the above test case, making the correctness as **False**.
