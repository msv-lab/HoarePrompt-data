Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `convert` takes a complex number `num` as input and returns its polar coordinates using the `cmath.polar` function. The test cases provided in the code seem to cover basic scenarios of converting real numbers to polar coordinates, which the code handles correctly. Additionally, there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the code. Therefore, the code is correct in this case.
