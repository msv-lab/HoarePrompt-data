Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function named `convert` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns a tuple containing the absolute value and phase of the complex number using the `abs()` and `cmath.phase()` functions respectively. 

The problem description states that the function should convert complex numbers to polar coordinates, which involves calculating the absolute value (magnitude) and phase (angle) of the complex number. The code correctly performs these calculations and returns the expected output based on the problem description.

There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description or output hints that the code does not handle correctly. Also, the output hints align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct in converting complex numbers to polar coordinates.
