Example Answer:
The function returns the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c` using the `abs()` and `cmath.phase()` functions respectively. Since the initial state is that `c` is a complex number, the absolute value and phase of a complex number can vary. Therefore, the output state after running the code is: `c` is a complex number and the function returns the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`.
Output State: **`c` is a complex number and the function returns the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c**.
