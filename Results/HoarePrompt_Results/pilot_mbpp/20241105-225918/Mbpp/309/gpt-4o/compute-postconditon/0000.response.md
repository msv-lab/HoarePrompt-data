Example Answer:
The function returns the greater value between `a` and `b` using a ternary operator. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is returned, otherwise `b` is returned. The values of `a` and `b` are integers, so the output state is `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and the function returns the greater value between `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and the function returns the greater value between `a` and `b**`.
