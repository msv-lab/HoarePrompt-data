Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the function to find the maximum of two numbers. The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the greater value between them. The code uses a ternary operator to compare `a` and `b` and return the larger value. The code also includes test cases that verify the implementation for different scenarios, and in all cases, the function returns the correct maximum value. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code does not follow the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
