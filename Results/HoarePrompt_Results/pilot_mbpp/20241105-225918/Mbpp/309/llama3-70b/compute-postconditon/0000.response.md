Example Answer:
The function returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`, so the value returned will be the greater of the two integers. The state of the variables `a` and `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers, and the function returns the maximum value between them.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, and the function returns the maximum value between them**
