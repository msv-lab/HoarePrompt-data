Correctness: **False**

The given program `remove_lowercase` only removes lowercase characters from the input string and returns the modified string. However, the problem description specifies that the function should remove lowercase substrings, not individual lowercase characters. 

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program should remove the substring "ello" because it contains lowercase characters. But the given program will only remove the lowercase characters and return "HWrld", which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description and is incorrect.
