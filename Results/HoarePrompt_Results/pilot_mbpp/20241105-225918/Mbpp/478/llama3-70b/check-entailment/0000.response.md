Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `remove_lowercase` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string. This is achieved by using a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, checking if it is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the character is uppercase, it is included in the output string. If there are no uppercase characters in the input string, the function will return an empty string.

The output hints also support this assessment by stating that the function returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string `s`. Additionally, the hint mentions that if there are no uppercase characters, the function returns an empty string. Since the code logic aligns with the problem description and the output hints, and there are no edge cases mentioned where the code might fail, the code can be considered correct.
