Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description. The function `count_X` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the count of `elem` in `tup`. The implementation uses the built-in `count` method of tuples in Python, which accurately counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. Since the function assumes that `elem` is present in `tup`, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code, confirming that the code is correct for all potential cases.
