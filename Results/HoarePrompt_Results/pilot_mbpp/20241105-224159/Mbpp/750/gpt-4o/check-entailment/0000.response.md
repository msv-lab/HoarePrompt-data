Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given code defines a function `add_tuple` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input parameters. The function then concatenates the list and the tuple into a single list and returns the result. The code is simple and straightforward, and it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also confirm that the function is correctly concatenating the list and tuple into one list. Additionally, the provided test cases also pass, further validating the correctness of the code. Therefore, based on the code, description, output hints, and test cases, we can conclude that the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
