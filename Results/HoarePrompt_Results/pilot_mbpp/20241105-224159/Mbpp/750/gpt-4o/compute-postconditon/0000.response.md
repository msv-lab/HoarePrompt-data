Example Answer:
The function returns the concatenation of the list `lst` and the converted list `tpl`. Since the initial state only mentions that `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple, without specifying their contents, the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of the concatenated list from the return statement.
Output State: **lst is a list, tpl is a tuple, and the function returns the concatenation of lst and tpl as a list**
