Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided checks whether the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating no profit and no loss. The code aligns with the problem description as it only considers the equality of the two prices, which is the requirement for this specific task. The output hints also confirm that the function should return `True` if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`, which matches the code logic. There are no other potential cases mentioned in the problem description, and the code covers the main requirement accurately. Therefore, the code is correct.
