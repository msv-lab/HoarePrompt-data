Output State: **If `n` is less than or equal to 16, the loop does not execute. If `n` is greater than 16, the loop sets all non-prime numbers within the range of `i * i` and `n` to `False` in the `is_prime` list. Variables `n`, `is_prime[0]`, `is_prime[1]`, and `i` remain the same after the loop executes.**
