According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of `i * i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 16, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 4, and a non-prime `j` is set to the next non-prime number within the range of `i * i` and `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next non-prime number within the same range. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 16, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 4, a non-prime `j` is set to the next non-prime number within the range of `i * i` and `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
