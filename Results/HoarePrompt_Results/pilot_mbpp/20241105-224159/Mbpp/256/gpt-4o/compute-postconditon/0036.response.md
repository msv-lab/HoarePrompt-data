Output State: **If n is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute. If n is greater than 2, the loop iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of n. For each prime number i, the loop sets all multiples of i in the range of i * i to n - 1 to False in the is_prime list. If n is less than i * i, the loop does not execute. After the loop, the values of n, is_prime[0], is_prime[1], and i are unchanged. The function returns the sum of the is_prime list.**
