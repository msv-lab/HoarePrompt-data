According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n`, `is_prime[j]` is False. Since `j` is the loop variable and it increments by `i` each iteration, to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n + i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n + i`, `is_prime[j]` is False**
