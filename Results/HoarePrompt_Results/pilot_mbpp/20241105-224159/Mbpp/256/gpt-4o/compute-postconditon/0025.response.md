According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since `i` is 4, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 16 (4*4). Before the loop starts, adjust the states as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 16, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 4**
