According to the code, the loop will execute if n is at least 3. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer but if it's less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is 3 or greater. Additionally, since the loop starts from 2, the initial value of `i` should be 2. 
State: **`n` is 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2**
