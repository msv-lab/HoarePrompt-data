According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is within the range of `i * i` and `n`, incrementing by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 16, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 4, and a non-prime `j` is set to False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated to the next non-prime number within the range of `i * i` and `n`. Since `i` is 4, the next non-prime number after 4 within the range of 16 and `i * i` should be updated as the new value of `j`.

State: **`n` is greater than 16, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 4, and a non-prime `j` is set to the next non-prime number within the range of `i * i` and `n`**
