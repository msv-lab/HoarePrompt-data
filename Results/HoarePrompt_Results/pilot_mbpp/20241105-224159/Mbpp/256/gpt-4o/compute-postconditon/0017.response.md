According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range specified (`i * i` to `n` with step `i`) is valid. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 9 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `i` is 3. Since the loop uses the range `(i * i, n, i)`, the loop will execute again if `i * i` is less than `n`. In this case, `i * i` is 9 which is not less than 9, so `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is 10 or greater for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, the condition states that all `is_prime[j]` where `j` is any value becomes False, so all `is_prime[j]` where `j` is any value need to be adjusted to False.
State: **`n` is 10 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 3, and all `is_prime[j]` where `j` is any value becomes False**
