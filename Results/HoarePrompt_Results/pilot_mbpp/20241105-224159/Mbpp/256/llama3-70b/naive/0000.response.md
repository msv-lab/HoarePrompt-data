Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a helper function `is_prime` to check if a given number is prime. It then initializes a count variable to 0 and iterates through numbers from 2 to n-1, checking if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function and incrementing the count if it is prime. Finally, it returns the count of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number n.

The program follows the problem description accurately as it correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the input number for all potential cases. The `is_prime` function correctly identifies prime numbers, and the main function counts them accurately. Hence, the correctness is True.
