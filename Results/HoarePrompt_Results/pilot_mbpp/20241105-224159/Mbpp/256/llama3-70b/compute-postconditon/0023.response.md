According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 1 initially and becomes 2 if `func2(num)` evaluates to true, and `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 3. Since `n` remains constant regardless of the condition, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is for `num` to be less than `n`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`count` is 1 initially and becomes 2 if `func2(num)` evaluates to true, `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 3, `num` is less than n**
