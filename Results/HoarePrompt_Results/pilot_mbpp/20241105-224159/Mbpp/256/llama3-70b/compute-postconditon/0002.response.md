According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `num` is 2 or greater and `i` is 2, since the range starts from 2.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2**
