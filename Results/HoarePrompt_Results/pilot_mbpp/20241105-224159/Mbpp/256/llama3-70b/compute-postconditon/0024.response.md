Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2 initially and becomes 2 if `func2(num)` evaluates to true, `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 3, `num` is less than n.
Output State: **`count` is 2 initially and becomes 2 if `func2(num)` evaluates to true, `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 3, `num` is less than n**
