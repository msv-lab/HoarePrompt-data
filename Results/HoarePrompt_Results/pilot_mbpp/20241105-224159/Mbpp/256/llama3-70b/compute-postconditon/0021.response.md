Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is 1. After execution, `count` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
Output State: **`count` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3**
