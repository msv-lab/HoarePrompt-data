Example Answer:
If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and there is no change in the state of the variables. If `num` is 2 or greater, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration, and if `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `n`, `num`, and `i`. Since the code snippet is a return statement for True, it does not affect the state of the variables.
Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, no change in state. If `num` is 2 or greater, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration. The function returns True.**
