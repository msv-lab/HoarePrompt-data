According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 3. Since the loop iterates until `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)` in the next iteration. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 4**
