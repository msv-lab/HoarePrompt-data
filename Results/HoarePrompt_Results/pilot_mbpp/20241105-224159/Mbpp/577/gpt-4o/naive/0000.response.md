Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The provided Python function `last_Digit_Factorial` correctly calculates the factorial of a given number and returns the last digit of the factorial. The function iterates through the numbers from 1 to n and calculates the factorial by multiplying each number. Finally, it returns the last digit of the factorial by taking the modulus of 10.

The three test cases provided in the code snippet are:
1. `last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4`: The factorial of 4 is 24, and the last digit is 4, which matches the expected output.
2. `last_Digit_Factorial(21) == 0`: The factorial of 21 is a large number ending in 0, and the last digit is 0, which matches the expected output.
3. `last_Digit_Factorial(30) == 0`: The factorial of 30 is a large number ending in 0, and the last digit is 0, which matches the expected output.

Since the program handles the factorial calculation and last digit extraction correctly for the provided test cases, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
