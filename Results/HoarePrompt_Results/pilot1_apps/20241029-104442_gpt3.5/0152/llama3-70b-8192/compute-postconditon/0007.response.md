Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value of `m + 1`, where `m` is obtained from user input. The previous values of `m` and `i` are unknown, so the value of `i` is dependent on the user input value of `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input; `x` and `s` are assigned values based on user input; `ans` is positive infinity, and `i` is dependent on the user input value of `m`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input; `x` and `s` are assigned values based on user input; `ans` is positive infinity, and `i` is dependent on the user input value of `m`**
