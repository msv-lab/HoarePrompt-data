According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 0. Since `i` is already less than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will definitely execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`score` is an integer, `grade` is either "A", "B", "C", or "D", depending on the value of `ans`**
