Example Answer:
`s_left` is decremented by the value of `d[j]`, where `j` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `s_left` and `j` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `ans`, and `i` are integers, `j` is incremented by 1, `s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i] - d[j+1]`, and `s_left` is further decremented by `d[j]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `ans`, and `i` are integers, `j` is incremented by 1, `s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i] - d[j+1`, and `s_left` is further decremented by `d[j]`**
