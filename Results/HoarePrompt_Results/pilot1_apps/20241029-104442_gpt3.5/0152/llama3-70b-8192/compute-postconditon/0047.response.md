According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `k`, `s_left`, and `d[j]`. If `j` is less than `k` and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[j]`, the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the updated result after subtracting `d[j]` from `s`, `j` is less than `k`, and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[j]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (j + 1)
- If `s_left` is equal to `d[j]`, it needs to be updated to be greater than `d[j]`

State: **`num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the updated result after subtracting `d[j]` from `s`, `j` is less than `k` and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[j]`, `j` is incremented by 1 if s_left is equal to d[j] then s_left is updated to be greater than d[j]**
