Output State: **Postcondition: If j is not equal to -1, i is equal to m+1. If i is equal to m, t is assigned the value of x; otherwise, t is assigned the value of a[i]. If j is not equal to -1, s_left is assigned the value of s - b[i] - d[j], j is initialized to 0, and cnt is assigned the value of c[j]. If j is -1, no changes are made to the variables.**
