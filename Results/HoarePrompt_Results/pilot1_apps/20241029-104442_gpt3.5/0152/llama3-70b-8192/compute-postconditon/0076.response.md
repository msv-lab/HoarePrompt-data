Postcondition: **`cnt` is 0, if `j` is not equal to -1, then `cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`**

Precondition: `num1` and `num2` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if num1 > num2:
    result = num1 - num2
else:
    result = num2 - num1
```
Postcondition for if body: `num1` and `num2` are integers. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, then `result` is assigned the value of `num1 - num2`.
Postcondition for else body: `num1` and `num2` are integers. If `num1` is not greater than `num2`, then `result` is assigned the value of `num2 - num1`.
Postcondition: **`num1` and `num2` are integers. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, the function calculates the difference between `num1` and `num2` and assigns it to `result`. If `num1` is not greater than `num2`, the function calculates the difference between `num2` and `num1` and assigns it to `result`.**

Precondition: `temperature` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if temperature < 0:
    status = "Freezing"
elif temperature >= 0 and temperature < 20:
    status = "Cold"
else:
    status = "Warm"
```
Postcondition for if body: `temperature` is an integer. If `temperature` is less than 0, then `status` is "Freezing".
Postcondition for else body: `temperature` is an integer. If `temperature` is not less than 0 but less than 20, then `status` is "Cold". If `temperature` is 20 or greater, then `status` is "Warm".
Postcondition: **`temperature` is an integer. If `temperature` is less than 0, `status` is "Freezing". If `temperature` is between 0 (inclusive) and 20 (exclusive), `status` is "Cold". If `temperature` is 20 or greater, `status` is "Warm".**

Precondition: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if a + b > c:
    result = "Sum greater than c"
else:
    result = "Sum not greater than c"
```
Postcondition for if body: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than `c`, then `result` is "Sum greater than c".
Postcondition for else body: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If the sum of `a` and `b` is not greater than or equal to `c`, then `result` is "Sum not greater than c".
Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than `c`, the result is "Sum greater than c". If the sum of `a` and `b` is not greater than `c`, the result is "Sum not greater than c".**

Precondition: `score` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "D"
```
Postcondition for if body: `score` is an integer. If `score` is 90 or greater, then `grade` is "A".
Postcondition for else body: `score` is an integer. If `score` is not 90 or greater but is 80 or greater, then `grade` is "B". If `score` is not 90 or greater, not 80 or greater but is 70 or greater, then `grade` is "C". If `score` is less than 70, then `grade` is "D".
Postcondition: **`score` is an integer. If `score` is 90 or greater, `grade` is "A". If `score` is between 80 (inclusive) and 90 (exclusive), `grade` is "B". If `score` is between 70 (inclusive) and 80 (exclusive), `grade` is "C". If `score` is less than 70, `grade` is "D".**
