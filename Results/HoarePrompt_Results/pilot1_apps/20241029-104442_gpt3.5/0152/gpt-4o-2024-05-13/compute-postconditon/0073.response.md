Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Since `j` is the only variable affected and no calculations are based on its value, the output state is: `num1` and `num2` are integers, `operation` is a string. If `operation` is "+", `result` is the sum of `num1` and `num2". If `operation` is "-", `result` is the difference between `num1` and `num2". If `operation` is neither "+", nor "-", `result` is "Invalid operation". `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`num1` and `num2` are integers, `operation` is a string. If `operation` is "+", `result` is the sum of `num1` and `num2". If `operation` is "-", `result` is the difference between `num1` and `num2". If `operation` is neither "+", nor "-", `result` is "Invalid operation". `j` is increased by 1**
