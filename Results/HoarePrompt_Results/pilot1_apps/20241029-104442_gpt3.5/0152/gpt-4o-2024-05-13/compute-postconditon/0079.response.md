Postcondition: **`num1`, `num2` are integers, `operation` is a string, `result` is based on the operation, and `j` is less than 0. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`. Then, `time_with_both_spells` is computed as the product of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`. Finally, `min_time` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. If `d[j]` is not less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, the loop breaks.**
