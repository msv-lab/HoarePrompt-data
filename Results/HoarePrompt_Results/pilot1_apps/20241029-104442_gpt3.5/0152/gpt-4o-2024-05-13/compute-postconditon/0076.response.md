Example Answer:
The value of `time_with_both_spells` is calculated by multiplying the value of `remaining_potions` with the value of `a[i]`. The variable `remaining_potions` and `a[i]` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `time_with_both_spells`. Therefore, the Output State is: `num1` and `num2` are integers, `operation` is a string, `result` is based on the operation, and `j` is less than 0.
Output State: **`num1` and `num2` are integers, `operation` is a string, `result` is based on the operation, and `j` is less than 0**
