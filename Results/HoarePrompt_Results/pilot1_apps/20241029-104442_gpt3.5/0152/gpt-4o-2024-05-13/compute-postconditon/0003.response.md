Example Answer:
time_with_spell is assigned the value of remaining_potions multiplied by x. The previous values of remaining_potions and x are unknown, so the output state is: min_time is the product of n and x, i is assigned the value of k, time_with_spell is the result of remaining_potions times x.
Output State: **min_time is the product of n and x, i is assigned the value of k, time_with_spell is the result of remaining_potions times x**
