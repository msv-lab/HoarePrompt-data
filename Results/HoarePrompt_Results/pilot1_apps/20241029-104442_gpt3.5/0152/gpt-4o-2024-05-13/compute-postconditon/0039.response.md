Example Answer:
`remaining_manapoints` is assigned the value of `s - b[i]`, where `s` is the value of total mana points, and `b[i]` is the value of mana points required for the spell at index `i`. The previous values of `s` and `b[i]` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: Updated values of `min_time`, `i`, and `time_with_spell` based on the conditions of the initial state and the assignment of `i` to `m`; `remaining_manapoints` is the result of `s - b[i]`.
Output State: **Updated values of `min_time`, `i`, and `time_with_spell` based on the conditions of the initial state and the assignment of `i` to `m`; `remaining_manapoints` is the result of `s - b[i]`**
