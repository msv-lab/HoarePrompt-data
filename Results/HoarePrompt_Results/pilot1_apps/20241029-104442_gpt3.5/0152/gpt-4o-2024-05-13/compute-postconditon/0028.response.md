Example Answer:
The `min_time` is updated to be the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_spell`. The `time_with_spell` is calculated as `n * a[i]`, where `n` is a constant value and `a[i]` is an element in the array `a`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time` is updated, `i` is increased by 1, `time_with_spell` is calculated as `n * a[i]`.
Output State: **`min_time` is updated, `i` is increased by 1, `time_with_spell` is calculated as `n * a[i]`**
