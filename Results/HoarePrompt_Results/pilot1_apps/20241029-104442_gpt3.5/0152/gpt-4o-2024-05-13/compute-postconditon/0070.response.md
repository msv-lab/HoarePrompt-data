Example Answer:
`min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. The value of `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`, where `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[j]`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, and `j` are updated based on the initial conditions and the assignment of `i` to `m`, `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[j]`, and `time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value of `remaining_potions * a[i]`.
Output State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, and `j` are updated based on the initial conditions and the assignment of `i` to `m`, `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[j]`, and `time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value of `remaining_potions * a[i]`**
