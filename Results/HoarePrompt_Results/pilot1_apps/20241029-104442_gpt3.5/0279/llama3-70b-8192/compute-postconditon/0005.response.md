Example Answer:
`min_length` is assigned the value of `min_speed * t`. `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`, which is already calculated as `min_speed`. Therefore, `min_length` is calculated as the product of `min_speed` and `t`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the product of `min_speed` and `t`**
