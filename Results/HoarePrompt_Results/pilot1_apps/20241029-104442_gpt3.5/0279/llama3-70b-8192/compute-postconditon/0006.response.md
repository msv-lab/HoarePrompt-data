Example Answer: 
`iter_i` is assigned an iterator that starts from `t-1` and goes down to 1 (excluding 0). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the product of `min_speed` and `t`, `iter_i` is an iterator starting from `t-1` and going down to 1 (excluding 0).
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the product of `min_speed` and `t`, `iter_i` is an iterator starting from `t-1` and going down to 1 (excluding 0)**
