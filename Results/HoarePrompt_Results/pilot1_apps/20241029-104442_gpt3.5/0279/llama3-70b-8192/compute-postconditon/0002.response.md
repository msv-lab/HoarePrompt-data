Example Answer:
`max_speed` is assigned the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are based on user input, so the maximum speed can be derived from those values. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, and `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, and `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`**
