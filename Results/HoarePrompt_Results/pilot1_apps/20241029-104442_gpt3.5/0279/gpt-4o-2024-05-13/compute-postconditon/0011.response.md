According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `v1` is assigned to `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be updated to a value greater than 3.
State: **`v1` is assigned to a value greater than 3, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0 and updated value at index 1, `speeds` list now has the value of `d` at the last index, `i` is 3**
