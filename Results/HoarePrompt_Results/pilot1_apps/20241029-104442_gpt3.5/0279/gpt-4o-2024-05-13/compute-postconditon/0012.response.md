Example Answer:
The value of `speeds[i]` is updated based on the minimum of two values: `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. The value of `i` is 3, so `speeds[2]` will be updated. The updated value will depend on the comparison of the two expressions mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` is assigned to a value greater than 3, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0 and updated value at index 1, `speeds` list now has the value of `d` at the last index, `i` is 3, and `speeds[2]` will be updated based on the minimum value calculation.
Output State: **`v1` is assigned to a value greater than 3, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0 and updated value at index 1, `speeds` list now has the value of `d` at the last index, `i` is 3, and `speeds[2]` will be updated based on the minimum value calculation**
