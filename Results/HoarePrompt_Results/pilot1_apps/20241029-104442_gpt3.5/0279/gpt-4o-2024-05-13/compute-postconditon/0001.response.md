Example Answer:
`t` and `d` are assigned values from the result of `map(int, input().split())`. Here, `input().split()` splits the input by spaces, `map(int, ...)` converts each split part to an integer, and `t` and `d` are assigned these values. Since the initial state mentions `v1` and `v2` are input integers, after running the code, `t` and `d` will contain the input integer values.
Output State: **`v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`**
