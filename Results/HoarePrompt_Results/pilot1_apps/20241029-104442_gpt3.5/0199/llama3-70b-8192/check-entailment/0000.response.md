Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by `s` liters of kvass. In such a scenario, it should print `-1`. However, the program does not account for this situation and only prints the value of the least keg in other cases. This means that the program is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases.
