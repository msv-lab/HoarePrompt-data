Example Answer:
`low` is assigned the value of `mid`, but the initial values of `mid`, `high`, and other variables are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is assigned the value of `mid`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is assigned the value of `mid`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`**
