Example Answer: 
Since the condition for the loop is not met, the loop will not be executed. The values of `low` and `high` will retain their initial values. The `print(-1)` statement will output -1, but the variables `low` and `high` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`low` is initial value, `high` is initial value**
