Postcondition: **`n`, `s`, `volumes`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass` remain the same. `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If volumes[i] is less than or equal to min_keg_volume, `i` is increased by 1. If volumes[i] is greater than min_keg_volume, possible_to_take is calculated as the minimum of the difference between volumes[i] and min_keg_volume, and remaining_kvass. Then, remaining_kvass is updated by subtracting possible_to_take.**
