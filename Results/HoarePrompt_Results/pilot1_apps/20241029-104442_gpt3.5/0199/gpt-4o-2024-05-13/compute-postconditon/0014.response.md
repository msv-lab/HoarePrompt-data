Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, `volumes` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of all integers in the list `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the smallest volume in the list `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is the total volume of kvass. If `remaining_kvass` is 0, the loop is terminated, `i` is increased by 1.**
