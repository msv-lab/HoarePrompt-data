Example Answer:
The list `volumes` is sorted in ascending order. The values of the list `volumes` are already within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, `volumes` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, `volumes` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order**
