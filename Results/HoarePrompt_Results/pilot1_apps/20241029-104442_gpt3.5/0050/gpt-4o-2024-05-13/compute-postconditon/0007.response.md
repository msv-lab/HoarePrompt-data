Example Answer:
`remaining_bourles` is assigned the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, `max_shares` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is an integer calculated from `r` and `min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is an integer calculated from `r` and `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`**
