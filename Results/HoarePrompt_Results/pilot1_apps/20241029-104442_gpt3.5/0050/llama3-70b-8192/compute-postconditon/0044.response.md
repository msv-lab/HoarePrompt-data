According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 0. Since `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, it means `i` should actually be 0 or greater for the loop to continue. All other variables remain the same.
State: **`shares`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same; `i` is 0 or greater**
