Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` contains the integers from the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is updated if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, and `i` is an integer within the specified range. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop is terminated. `i` is increased by 1.**
