Your task:

Precondition: `num1` and `num2` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if num1 > num2:
    max_num = num1
else:
    max_num = num2
```

Postcondition for if body: If `num1` is greater than `num2`, `max_num` is assigned the value of `num1`
Postcondition for else body: If `num1` is not greater than `num2`, `max_num` is assigned the value of `num2`
Postcondition: **`num1` and `num2` are integers. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, then `max_num` is assigned the value of `num1`. Otherwise, `max_num` is assigned the value of `num2`.**
