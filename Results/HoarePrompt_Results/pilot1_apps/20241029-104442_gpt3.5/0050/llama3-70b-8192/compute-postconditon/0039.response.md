Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. The previous values of `r`, `shares`, and `b[i]` are known. Therefore, the new value of `r` can be calculated based on those values. 
Output State: **`shares`, `n`, `m`, `r` is updated based on the formula `r += shares * b[i]`, `s`, `b` remain the same**
