Example Answer:
The list `possible_orientations` is assigned four tuples with the values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` rearranged in different orders. The previous values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are unknown, so the output state is:
Output State: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`**
