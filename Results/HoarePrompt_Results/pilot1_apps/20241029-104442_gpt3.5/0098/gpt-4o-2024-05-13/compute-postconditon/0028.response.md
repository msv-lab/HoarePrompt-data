Example Answer:
`a3` is assigned the value of the fifth element of `data` as an integer, and `b3` is assigned the value of the sixth element of `data` as an integer. The previous values of `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` is the first element of `data` as an integer, `b1` is the second element of `data` as an integer, `a2` is the third element of `data` as an integer, `b2` is the fourth element of `data` as an integer, `a3` is the fifth element of `data` as an integer, `b3` is the sixth element of `data` as an integer.
Output State: **`a1` is the first element of `data` as an integer, `b1` is the second element of `data` as an integer, `a2` is the third element of `data` as an integer, `b2` is the fourth element of `data` as an integer, `a3` is the fifth element of `data` as an integer, `b3` is the sixth element of `data` as an integer**
