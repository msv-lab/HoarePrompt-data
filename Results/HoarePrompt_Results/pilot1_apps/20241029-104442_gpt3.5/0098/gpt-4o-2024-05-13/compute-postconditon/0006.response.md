A `StopIteration` exception could occur at the `next(iterator)` line when there are no more elements to iterate over. If this exception occurs, the program will break out of the loop. 

Therefore, the output state is: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs during the iteration, the program breaks out of the loop.**
