Postcondition: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, and `h3` are updated based on the next tuple in the iterator. If either the sum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the maximum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, or the maximum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the sum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, then the function returns 'YES'.**

Precondition: `n` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if n % 2 == 0:
    return 'Even'
else:
    return 'Odd'
```
Postcondition for if body: If `n` is divisible by 2 without a remainder, the function returns 'Even'
Postcondition for else body: If `n` is not divisible by 2 without a remainder, the function returns 'Odd'
Postcondition: **`n` is an integer. If `n` is divisible by 2 without a remainder, the function returns 'Even'. Otherwise, the function returns 'Odd'.**
