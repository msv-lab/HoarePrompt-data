Example Answer:
The code snippet returns the string 'YES'. The variables `possible_orientations`, `iterator`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, and `h3` are not affected by the return statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned new values based on the next tuple in the iterator.
Output State: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned new values based on the next tuple in the iterator**
