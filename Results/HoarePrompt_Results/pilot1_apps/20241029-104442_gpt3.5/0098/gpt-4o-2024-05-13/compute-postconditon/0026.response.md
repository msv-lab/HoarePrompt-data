Example Answer:
`a1` is assigned the value of the first element of `data` converted to an integer, and `b1` is assigned the value of the second element of `data` converted to an integer. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` is the first element of `data` as an integer, `b1` is the second element of `data` as an integer.
Output State: **`a1` is the first element of `data` as an integer, `b1` is the second element of `data` as an integer**
