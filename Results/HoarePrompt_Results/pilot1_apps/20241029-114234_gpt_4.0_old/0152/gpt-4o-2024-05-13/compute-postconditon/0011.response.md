Precondition: variable `i` is less than -1
Program fragment:
```
if d[i] <= s:
    remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[i])
    time_with_spell = remaining_potions * x
    min_time = min(min_time, time_with_spell)

```
Postcondition for if body: variable `i` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[i])`, `time_with_spell` is `remaining_potions * x`, `min_time` is `min(min_time, time_with_spell)`
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
Postcondition: **`i` is less than -1. If `d[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then `remaining_potions` is set to `max(0, n - c[i])`, `time_with_spell` is set to `remaining_potions * x`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum of `min_time` and `time_with_spell`.**
