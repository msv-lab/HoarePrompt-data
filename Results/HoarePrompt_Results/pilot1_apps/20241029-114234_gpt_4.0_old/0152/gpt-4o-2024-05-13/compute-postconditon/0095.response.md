`remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`. The other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `variable i is less than -1`, `remaining_manapoints is s - b[i]`, `j is k`, `remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[j])`.

Output State: **variable `i` is less than -1, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, `j` is `k`, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`**
