According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to be able to execute again, `i` must be less than 0 after increasing it by 1. This means that `i` before being increased must have been less than -1.

State: **variable `i` is less than -1**
