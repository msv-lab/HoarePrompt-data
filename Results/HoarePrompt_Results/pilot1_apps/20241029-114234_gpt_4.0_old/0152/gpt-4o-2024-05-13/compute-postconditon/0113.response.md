Precondition: `num` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `j` is less than 0 before increment and increased by 1
Program fragment:
```
if d[j] <= remaining_manapoints:
    remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[j])
    time_with_both_spells = remaining_potions * a[i]
    min_time = min(min_time, time_with_both_spells)
else:
    break

```
Postcondition for if body: `num` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `j` is less than 0 before increment and increased by 1, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`, `min_time` is the smaller value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`
Postcondition for else body: `num` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `j` is less than 0 before increment and increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Postcondition: **`num` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `j` is less than 0 before increment and increased by 1. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is set to `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is computed as `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to the smaller value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, the loop or conditional block is exited.**
