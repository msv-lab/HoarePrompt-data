To determine the necessary state adjustments, let's analyze the given `while` loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The given `while` loop is:
```python
while i < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the code, we know that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 0.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `score` is an integer,
- `grade` is a string,
- variable `i` is increased by 1.

Since the `while` loop condition depends solely on the value of `i`, we need to ensure that `i` remains less than 0 for the loop to execute again. 

To achieve this, we need to adjust the state of `i` so that it is less than 0. Given that `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that `i` was less than -1 before the increment, so that after the increment, `i` remains less than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be less than -1 before the increment, so that after incrementing by 1, it remains less than 0.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`score` is an integer, `grade` is a string, variable `i` is less than -1**
