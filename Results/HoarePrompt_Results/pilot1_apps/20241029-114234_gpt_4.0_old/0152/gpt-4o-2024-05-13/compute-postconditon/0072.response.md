Precondition: `n` is a number, `m` is an integer, `p` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if n % 2 == 0:
    p *= 2
elif n % 3 == 0:
    p += 3
else:
    m -= 1

```
Postcondition for if body: `p` is multiplied by 2
Postcondition for else body: If `n` is divisible by 3, `p` is incremented by 3. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1.
Postcondition: **`n` is a number, `m` is an integer, `p` is an integer. If `n` is even (n % 2 == 0), `p` is multiplied by 2. If `n` is not even but divisible by 3 (n % 3 == 0), `p` is incremented by 3. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1.**
