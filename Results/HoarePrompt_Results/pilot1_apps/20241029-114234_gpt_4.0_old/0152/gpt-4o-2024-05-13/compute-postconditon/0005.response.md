Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9, `a` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i < x, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 2·10^9, `c` is a list of `k` integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n and c_i ≤ c_j if i < j, `d` is a list of `k` integers such that 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 2·10^9 and d_i ≤ d_j if i < j, and `min_time` is `n * x`. If `d[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[i])`, `time_with_spell` is `remaining_potions * x`, and `min_time` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `time_with_spell`.**
