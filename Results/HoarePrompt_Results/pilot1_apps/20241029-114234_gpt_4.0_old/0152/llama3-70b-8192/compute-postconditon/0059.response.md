The `continue` statement does not alter the state of variables but resumes the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an integer and `arr` is a list of integers. If `k` is less than the length of `arr`, then `arr[k]` is set to 100. If `k` is equal to the length of `arr`, then 100 is appended to the list. If `k` is greater than the length of `arr`, then `arr` is extended by `k - len(arr) + 1` zeros, and `arr[k]` is set to 100.**
