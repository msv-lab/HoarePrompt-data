`a` is assigned the value of the list obtained by mapping `int` to each element of the input split into parts. Other variables are not affected by this assignment, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `s` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `x` and `s` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers**
