To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze each part of the code and the initial state provided:

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `x` and `s` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `c` is a list of input integers, `d` is a list of input integers from input().split() converted to integers, `ans` is positive infinity, `i` is `m + 1`.

Code:
```
while i < 0:
    if i == m:
        t = x
    else:
        t = a[i]
    if b[i] > s:
        continue
    s_left = s - b[i]
    j = 0
    while j < k and s_left >= d[j]:
        s_left -= d[j]
        j += 1
    j -= 1
    cnt = 0
    if j != -1:
        cnt = c[j]
    ans = min(ans, (n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t)
    i += 1
```

Let's break down the loop:

1. The loop condition is `while i < 0`. Since `i` is initialized to `m + 1`, for the loop to start, `m` must be less than -1.
2. Inside the loop, the value of `t` is determined based on whether `i` equals `m`.
3. If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues (skips the remaining code and goes to the next iteration).
4. `s_left` is computed as `s - b[i]`.
5. The inner `while` loop decreases `s_left` by `d[j]` while `j` is less than `k` and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[j]`.
6. `j` is then decremented by 1.
7. If `j` is not -1, `cnt` is set to `c[j]`.
8. `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the computed value `(n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t`.
9. `i` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Execution Analysis:

Given that `i` starts at `m + 1`, the loop will only execute if `i < 0`, which implies `m < -1`.

### Output State Consideration:

1. **If `m >= -1`**: The loop will not execute because `i` will be `m + 1` which is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `ans` will remain positive infinity.
   - `i` will remain `m + 1`.

2. **If `m < -1`**: The loop will execute starting from `i = m + 1` until `i < 0` condition fails.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the logic inside the loop.
   - After the loop, `i` will be 0 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration until `i` reaches 0).

### Edge Cases Not Handled:
- The loop does not handle cases where `i` may be out of bounds for the lists `a` and `b`.
- If `b[i] > s` often, the loop may skip many iterations without updating `ans`.

### Final Output State:

Output State: **If `m >= -1`, the loop will not execute, `ans` will be positive infinity, and `i` will be `m + 1`. If `m < -1`, the loop will execute and `ans` will be the minimum computed value based on the loop logic, and `i` will be 0 after the loop terminates. Edge cases where `i` is out of bounds for `a` and `b` are not handled.**
