To determine if the loop can execute one more time and adjust the state accordingly, let's analyze the provided state and the loop condition step by step.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while i < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
```
variable `i` is increased by 1
```

For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < 0` must be true. Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it implies that the value of `i` in the next iteration must still be less than 0.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration with `i'`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i' + 1` (which is the new value of `i` after being increased by 1) must still be less than 0:
```
i' + 1 < 0
```
This simplifies to:
```
i' < -1
```

Therefore, `i` must have been less than -1 at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **variable `i` is less than -1**
