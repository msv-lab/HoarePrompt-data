It looks like there was a mix-up in the provided example. The program fragment and postconditions for the last example don't match up correctly. Let's reinterpret the last example correctly, and then I'll proceed with your task:

**Correct example:**
Precondition: `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer index, and `s` is an integer.
Program fragment:
```python
if b[i] > s:
    continue
```
Postcondition for if body: If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues to the next iteration without further processing the current iteration.
Postcondition for else body: There is no else part in the code.
Postcondition: **If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues to the next iteration without further processing the current iteration.**

Now let's proceed with your task.

Precondition: `m` and `n` are integers.
Program fragment:
```python
if n % 3 == 0:
    m *= 2
elif n % 3 == 1:
    m += 1
else:
    m -= 1
```
Postcondition for if body: If `n` is divisible by 3 (i.e., `n % 3 == 0`), `m` is multiplied by 2.
Postcondition for else body: If `n % 3 == 1`, `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1.
Postcondition: **`m` and `n` are integers. If `n` is divisible by 3, `m` is multiplied by 2. If `n % 3 == 1`, `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1.**

We've included all boundary conditions and logic within the postcondition. If there are any edge cases or missing logic in the program fragment, they should be captured in the postcondition to ensure correctness.
