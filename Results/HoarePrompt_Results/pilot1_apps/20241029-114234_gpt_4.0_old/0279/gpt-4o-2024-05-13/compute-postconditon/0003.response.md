`speeds[0]` is assigned the value of `v1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1` and the rest are zeros with length `t`.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1` and the rest are zeros with length `t`**
