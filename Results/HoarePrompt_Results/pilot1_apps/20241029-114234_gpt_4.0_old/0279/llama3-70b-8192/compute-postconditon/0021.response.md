The `StopIteration` exception can be triggered by the `next(iter_i)` call when the iterator `iter_i` is exhausted, i.e., when there are no more items to return. 

When the `try` block executes without raising an exception:
- `i` is assigned the next value from `iter_i`.
- `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.
- `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.
- `max_length` is incremented by the new value of `max_speed`.
- `min_length` is incremented by the new value of `min_speed`.

If a `StopIteration` exception is raised during the `try` block:
- The control is transferred to the `except StopIteration` block where a `break` statement is executed. This will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Summarizing the combined state after the complete execution of the `try` statement:

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; if the iterator `iter_i` is not exhausted, `i` is the next value from `iter_i`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`. If the iterator `iter_i` is exhausted, the loop or if statement containing the `try` block is exited.**
