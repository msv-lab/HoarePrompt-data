`min_length` is assigned the value of `min_speed * t`, where `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, and `t` is an input integer within its range. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is `max_speed * t`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t`.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is `max_speed * t`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t`.**
