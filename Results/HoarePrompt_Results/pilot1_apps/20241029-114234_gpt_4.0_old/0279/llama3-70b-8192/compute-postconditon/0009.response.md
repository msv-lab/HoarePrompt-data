Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`; `max_length` is `max_speed * t`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t`; `iter_i` is an iterator over the range from `t - 1` to `1` decreasing by `1`; `i` is the next value of `iter_i`; `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`**
