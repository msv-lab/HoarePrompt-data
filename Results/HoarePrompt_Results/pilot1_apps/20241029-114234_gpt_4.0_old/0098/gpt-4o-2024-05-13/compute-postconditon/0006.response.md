A `StopIteration` exception might be triggered at `w2, h2, w3, h3 = next(iterator)` if there are no more items to retrieve from the iterator. If this exception is raised, the function does not return a value but breaks out of the loop or control structure where the `try` block is nested. If no exception occurs, the function evaluates the given conditions to possibly return 'YES'.

Considering all possibilities, the output state of the program is as follows:

Output State: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list containing the tuples (a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), and (b2, a2, b3, a3); `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`; `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned the next tuple from `iterator`. If `w2 + w3 <= a1` and `max(h2, h3) <= b1`, or `max(w2, w3) <= a1` and `h2 + h3 <= b1`, then the function returns 'YES'. If `h2 + h3 <= b1` and `max(w2, w3) <= a1`, or `max(h2, h3) <= b1` and `w2 + w3 <= a1`, then the function returns 'YES'. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the state is unknown, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
