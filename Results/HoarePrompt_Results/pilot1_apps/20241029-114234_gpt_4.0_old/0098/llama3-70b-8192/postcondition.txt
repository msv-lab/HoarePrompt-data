`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are input integers. If the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a2` and `b2` and the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a2` and `b2`, then if the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a3` and `b3` and the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a3` and `b3`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is not greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a2` and `b2` or the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is not greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a2` and `b2`, then if the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a3` and `b3` and the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a3` and `b3`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
