Postcondition: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are input integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3` and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.**
