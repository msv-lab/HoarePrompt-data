`high` is set to `mid - 1`. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is set to `mid` if `total` is less than `s`, otherwise `high` is set to `mid - 1`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in v, `low < high`, `high` is mid - 1**
