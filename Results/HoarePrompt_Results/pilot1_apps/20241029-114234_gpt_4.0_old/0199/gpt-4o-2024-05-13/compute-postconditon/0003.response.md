`total_volume` is assigned the value `sum(volumes)`, which is the sum of all elements in the sorted list `volumes`. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are input integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`.

Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`**
