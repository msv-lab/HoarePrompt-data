`remaining_kvass` is decremented by `possible_to_take`. The previous values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is the input integer minus `possible_to_take`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is less than -1, `possible_to_take` is the minimum value between `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`**
