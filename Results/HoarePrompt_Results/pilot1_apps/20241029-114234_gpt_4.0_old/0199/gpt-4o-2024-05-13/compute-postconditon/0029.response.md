Postcondition: **`n` is less than -2, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is an input integer. If `remaining_kvass` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `remaining_kvass` is not 0, the loop or if statement continues to execute following the given logic concerning `volumes[i]`, `min_keg_volume`, and `possible_to_take`.**
