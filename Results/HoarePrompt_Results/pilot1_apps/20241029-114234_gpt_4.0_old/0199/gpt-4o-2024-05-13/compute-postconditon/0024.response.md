The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables but skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is less than -2, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is an input integer, `i` is `n + 2`**
