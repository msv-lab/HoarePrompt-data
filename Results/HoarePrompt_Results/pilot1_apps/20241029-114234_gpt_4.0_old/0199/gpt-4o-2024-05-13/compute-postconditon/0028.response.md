The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly within. The values of the variables do not change.

Output State: **`n` is less than -2, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is an input integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
