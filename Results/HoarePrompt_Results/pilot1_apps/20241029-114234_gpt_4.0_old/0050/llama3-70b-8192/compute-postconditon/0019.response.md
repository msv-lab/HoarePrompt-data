`shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`. The value of `r` is unknown, but `i` is an index less than -1, meaning it refers to an element in `s` from the end of the list. The exact values of `r`, `s`, and `shares` are unknown.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with conditions on `c` based on `a` and `b`; variable `i` is less than -1; `shares` is incremented by `r // s[i]`**
