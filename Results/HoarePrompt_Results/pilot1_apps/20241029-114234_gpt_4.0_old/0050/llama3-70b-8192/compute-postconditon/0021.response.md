The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with conditions on `c` based on `a` and `b`; variable `i` is less than -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
