Precondition: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is the value of `m`

Program fragment:
```
if shares > 0:
    r += shares * b[i]
    shares = 0
else:
    break

```
Postcondition for if body: The integer `r` is incremented by `shares * b[i]`, `shares` is set to 0.
Postcondition for else body: Execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `shares` is 0.
Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is the value of `m`. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is incremented by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
