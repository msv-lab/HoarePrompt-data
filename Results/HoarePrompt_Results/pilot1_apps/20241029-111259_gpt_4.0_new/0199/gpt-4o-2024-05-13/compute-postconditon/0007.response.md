`i` is assigned the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers; `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers; `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`; `min_keg_volume` is the smallest integer in `volumes`; `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`; `i` is equal to `n`.
