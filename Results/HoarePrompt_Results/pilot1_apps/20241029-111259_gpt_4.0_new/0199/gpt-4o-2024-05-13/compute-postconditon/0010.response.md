`remaining_kvass` is decremented by the value of `possible_to_take`, which is `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`. The states of `n`, `s`, `volumes`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `i`, and `possible_to_take` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers; `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers; `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`; `min_keg_volume` is the smallest integer in `volumes`; `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`; `i` is equal to `n`; `possible_to_take` is `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`.

Output State: **`n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers; `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers; `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`; `min_keg_volume` is the smallest integer in `volumes`; `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`; `i` is equal to `n`; `possible_to_take` is `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`.**
