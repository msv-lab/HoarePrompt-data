Postcondition: **variable `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than 0; `a` and `b` are integers with `a` updated to `a - b` if `a` > `b`, otherwise `b` is updated to `b - a`. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the loop continues without changing `remaining_kvass`. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is set to the minimum of `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`.**

This postcondition summarizes the effects of the if-else structure in the program fragment, considering both the given precondition and the operations performed in each branch.
