Precondition: `temperature` is a float representing the temperature in degrees Celsius, and `threshold` is a float representing the warning threshold for temperature.
Program fragment:
```python
if temperature > threshold:
    alert = True
else:
    alert = False
```
Postcondition for if body: The boolean variable `alert` is set to `True`.
Postcondition for else body: The boolean variable `alert` is set to `False`.
Postcondition: **`temperature` and `threshold` are floats. If `temperature` is greater than `threshold`, then `alert` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `alert` is set to `False`.**
