`max_shares` is assigned the value `r // min_buy_price`, which is the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input; `s` is a list of integers obtained from new input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`; `max_shares` is the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`.
