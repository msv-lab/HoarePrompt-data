Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it correctly outputs the initial amount of bourles `r`, as no profit can be made. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the current bourles, computes the remaining bourles after buying shares, and then calculates the total bourles after selling all shares at the maximum sell price. The program handles edge cases such as no profitable transaction scenarios and verifies the conditions correctly to ensure the maximum bourles are held after the evening. The examples provided in the output description align with the expected logic and calculations as performed by the program.
