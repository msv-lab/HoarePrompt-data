The list `s` is re-assigned with the output of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string in the list to an integer. The initial state specifies that `s` is already a list of `n` integers between 1 and 1000, so the new list will also be a list of `n` integers between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a re-assigned list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of `m` integers each between 1 and 1000.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a re-assigned list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of `m` integers each between 1 and 1000.**
