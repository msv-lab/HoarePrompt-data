Postcondition: **`i` is increased by 1 and is less than 0; `n`, `m`, `b`, `r`, `s`, and `shares` are unchanged. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
