Output State: **If `i` is initially less than 0 and `shares` is greater than 0, `r` will be incremented by `shares * b[i]`, `shares` will be set to 0, and `i` will be incremented until it is greater than or equal to 0 or `shares` becomes 0. If `i` is initially greater than or equal to 0 or `shares` is not greater than 0, all variables remain unchanged, and the loop does not execute. The value of `r` is printed.**
