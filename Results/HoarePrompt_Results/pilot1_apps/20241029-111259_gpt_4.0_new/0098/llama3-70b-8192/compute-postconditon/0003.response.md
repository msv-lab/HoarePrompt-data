The `print` statement outputs `'YES'` to the console. The values of the variables `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are newly input integers, `a3` and `b3` are newly input integers, and `'YES'` is printed.

Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are newly input integers, `a3` and `b3` are newly input integers, and `'YES'` is printed**
