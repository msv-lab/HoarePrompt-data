`a2` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`, and `b2` is assigned the integer value of `data[3]`. The initial values of `a1` and `b1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]`, `b1` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `a2` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`, `b2` is assigned the integer value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`a1` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]`, `b1` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `a2` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`, `b2` is assigned the integer value of `data[3]`**
