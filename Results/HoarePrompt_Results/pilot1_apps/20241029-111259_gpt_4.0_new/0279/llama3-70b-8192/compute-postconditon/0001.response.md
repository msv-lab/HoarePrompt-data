`t` and `d` are reassigned the values from the input, which are split and converted to integers. The previous constraints on `t` and `d` no longer apply as they are replaced by the input values. The output state is: `t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100.

Output State: **`t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100.**
