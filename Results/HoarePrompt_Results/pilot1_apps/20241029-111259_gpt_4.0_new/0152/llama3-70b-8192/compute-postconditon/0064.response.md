The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` is 1. The state of `s_left` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i] - d[j]`; `j` is 1. 

Output State: **`s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i] - d[j]`; `j` is 1**
