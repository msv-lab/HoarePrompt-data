The function prints the value of `ans`, and `ans` has a value of positive infinity. The print statement does not change the state, so the output state is that `ans` remains positive infinity, `i` remains `m + 1`, and the function prints positive infinity.

Output State: **`ans` remains positive infinity, `i` remains `m + 1`, and the function prints positive infinity**
