`t` is assigned the value of `x`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If `j` is not -1, `cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`. If the loop executes, `j` is decremented by 1, and `s_left` is decreased by the sum of `d[0]` to `d[j-1]`. If the loop does not execute, `j` is -1 and `s_left` remains unchanged. `ans` is updated to `min(ans, (n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t)`; `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is less than 0; `t` is assigned the value of `x`.
