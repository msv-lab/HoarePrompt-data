`j` is incremented by 1, and its initial value is 2, so after execution, `j` is 3. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`, `s_left` is decreased by `d[1]`, `k` is greater than 2, `s_left` is decreased by `d[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`, `s_left` is decreased by `d[1]`, `k` is greater than 2, `s_left` is decreased by `d[2]`**
