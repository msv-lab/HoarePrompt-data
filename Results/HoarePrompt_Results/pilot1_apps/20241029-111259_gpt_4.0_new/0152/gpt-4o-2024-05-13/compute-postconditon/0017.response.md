Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `s` are integers with their respective constraints; `a` and `b` are lists of `m` integers; `c` and `d` are lists of `k` integers with their respective constraints and non-decreasing property; `i` is less than 0. If `d[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, `remaining_potions` is calculated as `max(0, n - c[i])`, `time_with_spell` is computed as `remaining_potions * x`, and `min_time` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `time_with_spell`.**
