Postcondition: **`remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, `k` is less than -1, `j` is `k + 1`. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated as `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` takes the minimum value between its current value and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, the execution breaks out of the loop or internal if statement.**
