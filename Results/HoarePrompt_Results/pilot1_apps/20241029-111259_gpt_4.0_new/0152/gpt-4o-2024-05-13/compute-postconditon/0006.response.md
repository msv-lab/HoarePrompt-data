The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `s` are integers with their respective constraints; `a` and `b` are lists of `m` integers with their respective constraints; `c` and `d` are lists of `k` integers with their respective constraints and non-decreasing property; `i` is increased by 1 and retains the value of `k`.
