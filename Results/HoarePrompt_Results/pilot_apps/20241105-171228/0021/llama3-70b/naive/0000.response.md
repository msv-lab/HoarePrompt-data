Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by finding their positions in the array and considering all possible scenarios. It handles the case where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array and also considers the case where swapping elements can increase the distance. The logic used in the program covers all potential cases described in the problem statement.
