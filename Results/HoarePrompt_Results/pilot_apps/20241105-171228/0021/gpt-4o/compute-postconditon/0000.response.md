Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is constrained by the precondition 2 <= n <= 100, so `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n.**
