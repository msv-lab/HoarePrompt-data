Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` now contains the updated list of divisors including the newly added value of `i`. The previous values of `divisors`, `x`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` contains updated divisors, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` has been incremented to the next value satisfying the loop condition.
Output State: **`divisors` contains updated divisors, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` has been incremented to the next value satisfying the loop condition**
