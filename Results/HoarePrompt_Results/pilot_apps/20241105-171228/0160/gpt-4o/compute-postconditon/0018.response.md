The value of `x` is divided by `i`, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. The initial state is `divisors` is a set containing the value of `x`, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. After executing the code, the new value will be added to the set `divisors`. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing the value of `x`, and additional values after dividing `x` by `i`**
