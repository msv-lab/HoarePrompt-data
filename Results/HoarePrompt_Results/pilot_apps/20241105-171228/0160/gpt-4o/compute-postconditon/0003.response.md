Example Answer:
`gcd_result` is assigned the value of `lst[0]`. The value of `lst[0]` is based on the input provided in list A. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from input, sum_A is the sum of elements in list A, and gcd_result is the first element of list A.
Output State: **N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from input, sum_A is the sum of elements in list A, and gcd_result is the first element of list A**
