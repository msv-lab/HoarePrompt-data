Output State: 
- If `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. 
- The loop updates the set `divisors` with all possible divisors of `x` up to its square root. 
- If `x` is not divisible by any integer in the range of 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, then `divisors` remains an empty set. 
- The final state of `divisors` will contain all unique divisors of `x` found during the loop execution.
