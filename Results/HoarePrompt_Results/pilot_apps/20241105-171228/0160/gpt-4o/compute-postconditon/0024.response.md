According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` contains the updated divisors after the execution of the if statement. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer in the range and the condition `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))` should still hold true.
State: **`divisors` contains the updated divisors after the execution of the if statement, `i` is the next integer in the range (incremented by 1), and `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`**
