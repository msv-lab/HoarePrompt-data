Example Answer:
n is incremented by 1. Since n is a positive integer, after execution n will be a positive integer greater than the initial value. The value of k is not affected by this operation. The value of x is dependent on the new value of k after the increment operation on n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than the initial value, k remains the same, x is a value based on the new value of k**
