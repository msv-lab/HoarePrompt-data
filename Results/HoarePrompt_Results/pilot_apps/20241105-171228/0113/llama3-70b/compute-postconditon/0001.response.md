Example Answer: 
The variable `x` is assigned the value of 10 raised to the power of `k`. Given that `k` is between 0 and 8, the value of `x` will be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 depending on the value of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is a value based on the value of `k`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is a value based on the value of `k`**
