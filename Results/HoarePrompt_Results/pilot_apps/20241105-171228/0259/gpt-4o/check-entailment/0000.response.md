Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly defines a function `find_bus_route` that takes in the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and a list of tuples representing the bus routes.
- It iterates through each bus route, calculates the wait time for Serval to catch the bus based on the arrival time of the first bus and the interval between buses, and then selects the route with the minimum wait time.
- The code handles the case where Serval arrives exactly at the time of the first bus correctly by setting the wait time to 0.
- The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description provided, as it determines the bus route Serval will take based on the given criteria.
- The output is a single number representing the bus route Serval will take, which matches the expected output format.
