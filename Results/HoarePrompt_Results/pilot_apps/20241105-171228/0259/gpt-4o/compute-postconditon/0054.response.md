According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is assigned the integer value of the second element in `data`, `bus_routes` contains tuples `(s_i, d_i)`, `i` is 2, `s_i` is assigned the integer value of the element at index 4 in `data`, `d_i` is assigned the integer value of the element at index 2 + 2 * 2 + 1 in `data`, and a new tuple `(s_i, d_i)` is appended to `bus_routes`. To execute the loop one more time, the variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and a new tuple `(s_i, d_i)` needs to be appended to `bus_routes`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is assigned the integer value of the second element in `data`, `bus_routes` contains tuples `(s_i, d_i)`, `i` is 3, `s_i` is assigned the integer value of the element at index 4 in `data`, `d_i` is assigned the integer value of the element at index 2 + 2 * 2 + 1 in `data`, and a new tuple `(s_i, d_i)` is appended to `bus_routes`**
