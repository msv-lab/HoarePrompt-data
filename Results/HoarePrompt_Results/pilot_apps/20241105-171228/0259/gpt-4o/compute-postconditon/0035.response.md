The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a bus route with the arrival time of the first bus and the interval between two buses. The function calculates the minimum wait time among all routes and the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once to calculate the minimum wait time and chosen route. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `min_wait_time` will remain positive infinity, and `chosen_route` will remain -1. The function returns `chosen_route`, which is the index of the route with the minimum wait time. 
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, t, and bus_routes. It calculates the minimum wait time among all routes and the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If n is greater than 0, it returns the chosen route index. If n is 0, it returns -1.**
