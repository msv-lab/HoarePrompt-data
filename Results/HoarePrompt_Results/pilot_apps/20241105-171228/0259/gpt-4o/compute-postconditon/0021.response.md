Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is either -1 or 2 based on the comparison of `wait_time` and `min_wait_time`. `n` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 1, `s_i` and `d_i` retain their assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to 2. Otherwise, `min_wait_time` retains its previous value, and `chosen_route` remains as -1. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the if-else block, ensuring the initial state of variables is preserved.***
