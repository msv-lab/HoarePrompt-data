Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates through the bus routes to calculate the minimum wait time for each route based on the given time `t`. It then determines the index of the route with the minimum wait time and returns that index. If `n` is 0, indicating no bus routes, the function returns -1.**
