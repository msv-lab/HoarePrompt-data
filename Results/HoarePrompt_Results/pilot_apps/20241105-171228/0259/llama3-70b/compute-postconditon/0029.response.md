Postcondition: ***`min_time` is the minimum value between positive infinity and the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is either 1 or 3, `buses` is a list of buses with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `s` is the first value of the third element in `buses`, `d` is the second value of the third element in `buses`, `time` is the result of `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`.***
