According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the loop variable `_` is within the range specified by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `s` and `d` are assigned values from user input, and the tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. To execute the loop one more time, the loop variable `_` needs to be adjusted to be within the range specified by `n+1`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `s` and `d` are assigned values from user input, the tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`, `_` is within the range of `n+1`**
