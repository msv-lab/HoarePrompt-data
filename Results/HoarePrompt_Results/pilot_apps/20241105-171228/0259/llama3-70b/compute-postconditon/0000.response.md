Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values from splitting the input by space and converting them to integers. Since the initial states of `n` and `t` are not provided, the output state is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5**
