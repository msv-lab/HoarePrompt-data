Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly converts an integer score into words as per the problem description. It checks if the input score is less than 10, between 10 and 19, or 20 and greater and prints the corresponding word. The logic used for converting numbers to words aligns with the provided problem description. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the code is handling the conversions properly for different ranges of input scores. Therefore, the code can be considered correct.
