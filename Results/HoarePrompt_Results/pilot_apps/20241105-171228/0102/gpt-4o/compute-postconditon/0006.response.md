Example Answer: 
The function returns the combination of the word representing the tens digit of `n` divided by 10 from the list `tens`, a hyphen, and the word representing the ones digit of `n` modulo 10 from the list `ones`. Since `n` is derived from `s`, where `s` is an integer between 0 and 99, the output state will depend on the specific value of `s`. 
Output State: **Depends on the specific value of `s`**
