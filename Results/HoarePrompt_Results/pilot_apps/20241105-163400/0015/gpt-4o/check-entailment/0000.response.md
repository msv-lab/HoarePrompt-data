Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If `b` is equal to `a`, the code correctly prints 'YES' as the favorite number of Vasya is equal to the first element of the sequence.
- If `c` is equal to 0, the code correctly prints 'NO' as the difference between neighboring elements cannot be zero.
- If ((b - a) % c == 0) and ((b - a) / c >= 0), the code correctly prints 'YES' as the favorite number can be reached by incrementing by `c` from `a`. 
- In all other cases, the code correctly prints 'NO' as the favorite number cannot be reached according to the sequence conditions. 

The code meets the problem description for all potential cases based on the provided examples and logic.
