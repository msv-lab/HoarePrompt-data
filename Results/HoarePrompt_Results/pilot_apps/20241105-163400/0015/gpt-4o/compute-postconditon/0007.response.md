Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If ((b - a) % c == 0) and ((b - a) / c >= 0), the program prints 'YES'. In all other cases, the program prints 'NO'. The program ensures that the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of the division is non-negative.***
