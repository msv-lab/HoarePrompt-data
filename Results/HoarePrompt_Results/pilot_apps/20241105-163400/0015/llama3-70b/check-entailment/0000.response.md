Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to follow the problem description for all potential cases. 
1. If the difference `c` between the neighboring elements is 0 and if the first element `a` is equal to the favorite number `b`, the code prints 'YES' as expected.
2. If the difference `c` is 0 and the first element `a` is not equal to the favorite number `b`, the code prints 'NO' as expected.
3. If the difference `c` is not 0 and the condition `(b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0` is satisfied, the code prints 'YES' as expected.
4. If the difference `c` is not 0 and the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` is not met or `(b - a) / c` is less than 0, the code prints 'NO' as expected.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
