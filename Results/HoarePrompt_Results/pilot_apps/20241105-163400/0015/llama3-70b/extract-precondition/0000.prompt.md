You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Vasya likes everything infinite. Now he is studying the properties of a sequence s, such that its first element is equal to a (s_1 = a), and the difference between any two neighbouring elements is equal to c (s_{i} - s_{i} - 1 = c). In particular, Vasya wonders if his favourite integer b appears in this sequence, that is, there exists a positive integer i, such that s_{i} = b. Of course, you are the person he asks for a help.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contain three integers a, b and c ( - 10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) — the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number and the difference between any two neighbouring elements of the sequence, respectively.


-----Output-----

If b appears in the sequence s print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 7 3

Output
YES

Input
10 10 0

Output
YES

Input
1 -4 5

Output
NO

Input
0 60 50

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the sequence starts from integers 1, 4, 7, so 7 is its element.

In the second sample, the favorite integer of Vasya is equal to the first element of the sequence.

In the third sample all elements of the sequence are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.

In the fourth sample, the sequence starts from 0, 50, 100, and all the following elements are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.
Program:
```
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
if c == 0:
    if a == b:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
else:
    if (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

```
