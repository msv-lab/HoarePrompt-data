*`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, the program prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0 and the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is not 0 and the condition (b - a) % c == 0 is not met or (b - a) / c is less than 0, the program prints 'NO'.
