According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `l` < `r` and `num` < `r`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next integer after the current `num`, `l` and `r` remain the same.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers with `l` < `r` and `num + 1` < `r**`.
