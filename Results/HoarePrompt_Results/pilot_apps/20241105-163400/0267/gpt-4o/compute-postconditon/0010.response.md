Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged, with `l` being less than or equal to `r`. If `func(num, k)` evaluates to false, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
