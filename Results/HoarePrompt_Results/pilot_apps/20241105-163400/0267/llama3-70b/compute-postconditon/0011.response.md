According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is the next value after the last iteration. Since `i` is the next value after the last iteration, it means that `i` is equal to k, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is equal to k. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to k, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation**
