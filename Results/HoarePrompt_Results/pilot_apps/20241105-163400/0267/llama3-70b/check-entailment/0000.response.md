Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `count_numbers` that calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`.
- The function uses a helper function `count` to count the numbers meeting the criteria within a given range.
- The `count` function correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits within a given range.
- The final result is calculated by subtracting the count of numbers less than `l` from the count of numbers less than or equal to `r`.
- The code is concise and follows the problem description accurately. 
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct for all potential cases.
