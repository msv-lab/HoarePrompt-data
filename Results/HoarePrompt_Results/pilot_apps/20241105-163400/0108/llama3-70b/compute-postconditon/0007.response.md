Example Answer:
The character `char` is appended to the string `res`. The length of `res` increases by 1. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined and not empty.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined and not empty**
