Example Answer: 
The character `char` is appended to the string `res`. The previous value of `res` is unknown, and `char` can be any lowercase English letter. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined and not empty.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined and not empty**
