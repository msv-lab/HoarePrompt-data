According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `alphabet`. Since we don't have information about the `alphabet` variable, we cannot make any assumptions about the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5; `res` is an empty string, `alphabet` is defined and not empty**
