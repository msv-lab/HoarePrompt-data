Example Answer: 
A sublist of `data` starting from index `index` up to index `index + 6` is appended to the `cubes` list. The current value of `index` is 1, so a sublist of 6 elements starting from index 1 is appended to `cubes`. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains the sublist from index 1 to index 7 of `data`, `index` is 1, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains the sublist from index 1 to index 7 of `data`, `index` is 1, `i` is 0**
