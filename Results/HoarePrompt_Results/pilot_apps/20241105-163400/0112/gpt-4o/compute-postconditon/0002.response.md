Example Answer:
Each element in `used_cubes` is initialized as `False` and the length of the list is `n`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: Each set in `cube_faces` contains the unique integers present on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` contains the string representation of `num`, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`.
Output State: **Each set in `cube_faces` contains the unique integers present on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` contains the string representation of `num`, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`**
