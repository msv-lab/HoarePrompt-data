Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list of integers `num`. It iterates through each digit in `num` and checks if that digit is present in any of the cubes represented by `cube_faces`. If a digit is found in a cube, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a digit is not found in any cube, the function returns False. If all digits are found in the cubes or if `num` is empty, the function returns True. The function aims to mark the cubes that contain the digits from `num` in `used_cubes`.**
