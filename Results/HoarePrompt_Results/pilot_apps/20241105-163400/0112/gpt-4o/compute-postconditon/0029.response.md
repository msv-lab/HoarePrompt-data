Output State: **After the loop executes, the `used_cubes` list will have some elements set to True based on the conditions in the loop. The loop will check if each digit in `digits` is present in any of the cubes in `cube_faces`. If a digit is found in any of the cubes, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` will be set to True. If a digit is not found in any cube, the loop will return False. If `used_cubes` already has all elements set to True or if `digits` is empty, the loop will not execute.**
