Postcondition: ***`digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with one element set to `True`, `found` is `True`, `n` is at least 1. The if statement checks if the `i`-th element in `used_cubes` is not True and if `digit` is in the `i`-th element of `cube_faces`. If this condition is met, the `i`-th element in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop is broken. This postcondition covers the scenarios where the conditions are met for the if part, ensuring the specified variable states and relationships.***
