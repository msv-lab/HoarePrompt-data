According to the code, the loop can execute if the range `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `digits` having at least 1 character and `digit` being the first character ensures the loop can execute. Additionally, `cube_faces` containing unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` being a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`, and `found` being `False` do not directly impact the loop execution, but they are part of the initial state. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, `digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`, and `found` is `False`.
