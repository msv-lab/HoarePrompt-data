Example Answer:
The code reads n lists of 6 integers each representing cubes. The variable `cubes` will be a list of n lists of 6 integers. Since the initial state does not provide the specific values of the cubes, the output state will be: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive.**
