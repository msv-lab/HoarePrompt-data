According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cubes`. If the set cubes is not empty, the loop can execute. Since the set `digits` is empty before the loop starts, to ensure the loop executes, the set cubes should have at least one cube. Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is `digits` is an empty set, `cubes` is a set with at least one cube.
State: **`digits` is an empty set, `cubes` is a set with at least one cube**
