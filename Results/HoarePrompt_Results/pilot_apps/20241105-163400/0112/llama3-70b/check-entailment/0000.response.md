Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The code correctly reads the input of cube faces and extracts the unique digits from them. However, it does not handle the restrictions of not being able to make a 6 from a 9 and vice versa. This means that the code might incorrectly allow for the formation of numbers that violate this rule, leading to an incorrect maximum number x that Masha can make. 

For example, if Masha has a cube with a face showing 9 and another cube with a face showing 6, the code will consider both 6 and 9 as available digits. However, Masha cannot form the numbers 96 or 69 due to the rule mentioned in the problem description. This edge case is not covered by the code, making it incorrect.
