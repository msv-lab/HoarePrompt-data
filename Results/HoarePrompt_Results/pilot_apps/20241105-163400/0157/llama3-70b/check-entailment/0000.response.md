Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It first calculates the minimum number of fruits that can be used based on the ratios provided in the problem description, and then calculates the total number by multiplying the minimum number of each fruit by their corresponding ratios. The code handles all possible cases where Nikolay may not have enough of one type of fruit to cook the compote, as described in the problem statement. The output hints also confirm that the variables used in the code align with the problem description.
