Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown as they are input positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, and `min_lemon` holds the minimum value among them.
Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` holds the minimum value among them**
