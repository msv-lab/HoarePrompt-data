Postcondition: ***`assigned` has at least 2 elements. If there exists an element at index `i` of array `a` such that the difference between that element and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True. The value of `m` remains the same after the execution of the if statement. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement after setting `can_form` to True.***
