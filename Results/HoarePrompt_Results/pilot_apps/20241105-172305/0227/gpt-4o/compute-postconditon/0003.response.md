Example Answer: 
`m` is assigned the value 1. The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the `assigned` set, but the initial state of list `a` and set `assigned` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is 1, the smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the `assigned` set.
Output State: **`m` is 1, the smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the `assigned` set**
