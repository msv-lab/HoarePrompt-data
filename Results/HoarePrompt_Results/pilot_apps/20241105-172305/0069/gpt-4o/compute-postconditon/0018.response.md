According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 4, `results` is a non-empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x`, `s`, `balance`, `prefix_balances`, and `i` are all assigned values based on `data`. Since the previous iteration resulted in an IndexError due to list index out of range, it implies that the value of `n` is greater than the available indices in `data`. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `data`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **IndexError: list index out of range, `index` is 4, `results` is a non-empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is less than the length of `data`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, `prefix_balances`, `i` are assigned values based on `data`**
