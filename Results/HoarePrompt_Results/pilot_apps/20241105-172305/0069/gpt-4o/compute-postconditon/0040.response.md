Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`. The value of `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `n` is incremented by 1 if necessary, adjustments made to `results` based on the conditions mentioned above, `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`.
Output State: **`T`, `n` is incremented by 1 if necessary, adjustments made to `results` based on the conditions mentioned above, `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`**
