Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` has at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
