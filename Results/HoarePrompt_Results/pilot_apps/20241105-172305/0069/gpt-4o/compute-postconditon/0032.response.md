Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If (x - b) is divisible by `balance` and the result of (x - b) divided by `balance` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is incremented by 1. `prefix_balances` has at least 3 elements, and `b` is the third element in `prefix_balances. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
