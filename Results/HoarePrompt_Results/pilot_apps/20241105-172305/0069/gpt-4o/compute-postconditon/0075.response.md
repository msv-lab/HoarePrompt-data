Example Answer:
The list `prefix_balances` is initialized with `0` repeated `n + 1` times. The values of `n`, `x`, `s`, and `balance` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`**
