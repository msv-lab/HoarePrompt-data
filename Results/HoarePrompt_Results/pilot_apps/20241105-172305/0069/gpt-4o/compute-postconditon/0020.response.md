Example Answer: 
The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The `results` list is not mentioned in the initial state, so it can be assumed to be an empty list. After the execution of the code, the `results` list will contain a single element, `-1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `results` list contains `-1`.
Output State: **`results` list contains `-1`**
