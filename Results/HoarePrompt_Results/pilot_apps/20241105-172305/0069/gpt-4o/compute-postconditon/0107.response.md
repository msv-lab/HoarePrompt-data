According to the code, the loop can execute again if `results` has at least one more element to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` and `results` maintain their specified properties, ensuring the integrity of the program state, and `results` has at least one more element. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` should have at least one more element.
State: **`prefix_balances` and `results` maintain their specified properties, ensuring the integrity of the program state, and `results` has at least two more elements**
