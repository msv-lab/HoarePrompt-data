Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code has some issues:
1. The code initializes the `prefix_balances` list with a length of `(n+1)` but then iterates from `1` to `n` which may cause index out of range errors.
2. The condition `if x in prefix_balances:` is incorrect as it checks if the desired balance `x` is present in the `prefix_balances` list which is not the correct way to determine if there are an infinite number of prefixes.
3. The calculation of the count of prefixes with the desired balance is not correctly implemented and may lead to incorrect results.

Therefore, the code needs to be modified to address these issues in order to correctly determine the number of prefixes with a balance equal to `x`.
