Output State: If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If `votes` contains characters 'D' and 'R', the loop iterates through each character, appending the index to either `d_queue` or `r_queue` based on the character encountered. After the loop execution, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters in `votes`. `i` ranges from 0 to n-1, `v` takes the value of each character in the `votes` string.
**n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is a list containing indices of characters 'D' in the `votes` string, `r_queue` is a list containing indices of characters 'R' in the `votes` string, `i` ranges from 0 to n-1, `v` takes the value of each character in the `votes` string.**
