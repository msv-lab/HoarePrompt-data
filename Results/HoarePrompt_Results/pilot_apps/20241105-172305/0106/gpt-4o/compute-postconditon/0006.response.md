Example Answer:
The function `func` is called with the variable `a`, and it returns `block_a` and `floor_a`. The specific values cannot be determined without knowing the values of `a`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the output state is: The function `func` calculates the block and floor numbers of a given `apartment` based on the values of `m` and `k`. The function returns the block and floor numbers.
Output State: **The function `func` calculates the block and floor numbers of a given `apartment` based on the values of `m` and `k`. The function returns the block and floor numbers.**
