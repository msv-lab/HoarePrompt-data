Output State: **block_b is the block number, floor_b is the floor number returned by the function `func` for apartment `b`, if floor_a is 1, then the `time_to_exit` is 0, otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the difference between floor_a and 1, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between block_a and block_b modulo n, multiplied by 15, and `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.**
