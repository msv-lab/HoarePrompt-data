Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers based on the input provided, `a_floor` is calculated as described above; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
