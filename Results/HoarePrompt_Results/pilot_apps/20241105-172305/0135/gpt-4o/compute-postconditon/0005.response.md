Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of n divided by i. The value of i is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of the remainder. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
