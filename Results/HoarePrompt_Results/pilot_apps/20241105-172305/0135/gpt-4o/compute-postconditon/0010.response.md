According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `seen_remainders` is an empty set. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the previous iteration's `k`, so `i` should be equal to `k + 1`.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is equal to `k + 1`**
