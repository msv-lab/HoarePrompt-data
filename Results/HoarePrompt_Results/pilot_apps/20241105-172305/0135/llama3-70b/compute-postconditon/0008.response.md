According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the previous iteration. 
State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1`**
