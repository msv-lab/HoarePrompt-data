Example Answer:
The set `seen` is initialized as an empty set. The variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers with values obtained from user input, `seen` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with values obtained from user input, `seen` is an empty set**
