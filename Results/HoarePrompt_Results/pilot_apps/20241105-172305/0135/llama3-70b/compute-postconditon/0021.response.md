Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. After the loop executes, `seen` is a set containing all unique remainders from `n % i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated, the loop prints 'No' and exits. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute.**
