Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly handles all the possible scenarios as described in the problem description.
- If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, it prints '0'. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is not 0, it prints '?'.
- The code covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each scenario.
- The output hints also align perfectly with the code and further confirm that the code is correct for all potential cases.
