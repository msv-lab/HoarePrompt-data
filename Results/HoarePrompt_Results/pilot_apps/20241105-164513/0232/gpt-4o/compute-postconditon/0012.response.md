Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to `m` with corresponding values from list `k`, `current_counts` is updated to be greater than or equal to `desired_counts`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If all values in `current_counts` match the values in `desired_counts` for corresponding keys, the function returns 'YES'.***
