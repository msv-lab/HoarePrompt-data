According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to `m` with corresponding values from list `k`, `current_counts` is a default dictionary with integer values, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
