Postcondition: ***`color_counts` dictionary contains the count of each unique color in the `colors` list, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` dictionary contains the newly added key `color` with a value incremented by 1 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`, `i` is less than `n+1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j] and `window_counts[color]` is set to 0 after the if condition. This ensures that the count of the color in the `window_counts` dictionary is correctly initialized to 0 if the color was not already present. This logic guarantees the accurate tracking of the color counts in the `window_counts` dictionary, maintaining the integrity of the color counting process within the given constraints.***
