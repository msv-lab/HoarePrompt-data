Output State: `n` is greater than or equal to `i+2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `window_counts` dictionary is updated based on the `color` key with a value of 1 if `color` was already present or with a value of 0 if `color` was not already present, `found` remains True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts` is updated with a value of 0 for `color`.
