Example Answer: 
The dictionary `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. If the key `color` was not already present in the dictionary, it will be added with a value of 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `window_counts` dictionary may have a newly added key `color` with a value of 1.
Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `window_counts` dictionary may have a newly added key `color` with a value of 1**
