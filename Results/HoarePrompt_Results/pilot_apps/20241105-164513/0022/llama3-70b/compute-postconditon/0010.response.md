Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True initially and can be set to False if the condition `s[i] != s[n - i - 1]` is met. `i` is 1. If the condition is met, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the loop or if statement is terminated.***
