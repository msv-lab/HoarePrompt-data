According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True, and `is_spalindrome` can be set to False if `s[i] != s[n - i - 1]` for `i` equal to 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to ensure that `i` is less than `n // 2` and `is_spalindrome` is still True at the start of the next iteration. If `s[2] != s[n - 2 - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` should be set to False.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True, `is_spalindrome` is False if `s[2] != s[n - 2 - 1]` for `i` equal to 2**
