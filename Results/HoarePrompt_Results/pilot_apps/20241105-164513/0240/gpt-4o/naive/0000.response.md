Explanation: The program correctly identifies the smallest possible integer n that Vasya could pass to Kate by considering all the permutations of the remaining characters after removing the remembered substring. It then checks if the remembered substring is present in the generated number and the length of the number is correct. The program efficiently handles the given problem description for all potential cases.
