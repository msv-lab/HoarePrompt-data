According to the code, the loop will execute again if the next permutation of `chars` is generated and `func2(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true for the new `candidate`. At the end of the last iteration, the next permutation of `chars` was generated and `func2(candidate, sub)` returned true for the last `candidate`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated again and `func2(candidate, sub)` must return true for the new `candidate`.
State: **Next permutation of `chars` is generated again, `func2(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true for the new `candidate`**
