Example Answer: 
The function returns whether the string `sub` is in the string `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`. The function does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: `s` and `sub` are strings.
Output State: **Precondition: `s` and `sub` are strings**
