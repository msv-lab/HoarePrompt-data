Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It takes the string received by Kate and the substring Vasya remembers as input, then constructs the smallest possible initial integer n by iterating through the characters in the received string and appending only the characters that are present in the remembered substring. Finally, it appends the remembered substring to form the smallest integer n. The program handles the case where the substring can contain leading zeroes and ensures that the answer always exists. All the examples provided work correctly and the logic of the code aligns with the problem description.
