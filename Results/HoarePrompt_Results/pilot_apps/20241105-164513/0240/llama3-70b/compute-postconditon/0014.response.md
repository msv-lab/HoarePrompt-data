Output State: 
- If `t` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and `n` will remain an empty string.
- If `t` is not empty, the loop will iterate through each character in `s`, and if the character is in `t_set`, it will be appended to `n`.
- After the loop executes, `n` will contain all characters from `s` that are also present in `t_set`.
