Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is created with the unique elements of the string `t`. The variables `s` and `t` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, and `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, and `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`**
