Example Answer:
The function iterates through each character in `s` and appends characters that are also present in `t` to a new string `n`. If `t` is empty, the function returns 0. 
Output State: **The function returns a new string `n` containing characters present in both `s` and `t`, or 0 if `t` is empty.**
