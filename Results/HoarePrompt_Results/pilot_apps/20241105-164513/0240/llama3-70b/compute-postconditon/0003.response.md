Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned an empty string value. The values of `s`, `t`, and `t_set` remain the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, and `n` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` is a string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, and `n` is an empty string**
