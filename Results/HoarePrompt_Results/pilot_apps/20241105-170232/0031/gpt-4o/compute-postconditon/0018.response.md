Example Answer: 
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying the current value of `numerator` with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. Since `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` and `i` is 0, `(total_days - i)` will result in `2^n - 0` which is equivalent to `2^n`. Therefore, the new value of `numerator` will be `numerator * 2^n % MOD`. 
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * 2^n % MOD`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
