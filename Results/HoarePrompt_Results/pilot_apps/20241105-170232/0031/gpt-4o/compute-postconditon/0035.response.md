Example Answer:
The value of `B` is divided by `g` using integer division. The previous value of `B` is the denominator, and the value of `g` is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; A is the updated calculated value of p_shared, B is the integer division result of dividing the previous value of p_total by `g`.
Output State: **p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; A is the updated calculated value of p_shared, B is the integer division result of dividing the previous value of p_total by `g`**
