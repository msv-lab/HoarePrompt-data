Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after the loop executes, numerator will be the product of all values from (total_days - i) for i in range(k) modulo MOD, denominator will be the product of all values of total_days for i in range(k) modulo MOD. If k is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and numerator remains 1, denominator remains 1.**
