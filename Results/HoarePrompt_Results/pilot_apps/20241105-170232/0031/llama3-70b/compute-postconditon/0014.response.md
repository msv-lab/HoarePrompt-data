Output State: **If k is greater than or equal to 0, after the loop executes, numerator will be the result of multiplying the product of total_days - i for each i in the range of k, denominator will be total_days raised to the power of k, i will be k, total_days is a very large number. If k is less than 0, the loop won't execute and the values of numerator and denominator will remain 1. `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.**
