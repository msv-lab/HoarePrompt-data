Output State: **If `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1, after the loop executes, `seq` contains the integers from 1 to the maximum possible integer less than or equal to `n` that can be formed by the sum of consecutive integers starting from 1. The value of `n` is updated based on the initial input, and `k` remains the same. If `n` is less than 1 or `k` is less than 1, `seq` is an empty list.**
