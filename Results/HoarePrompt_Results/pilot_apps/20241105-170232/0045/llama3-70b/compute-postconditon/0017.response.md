Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, an empty list `seq` is initialized, and `i` is 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` contains 1, `n` is the first integer input minus 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, if `n` is less than 1, `seq` is empty, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1.***
