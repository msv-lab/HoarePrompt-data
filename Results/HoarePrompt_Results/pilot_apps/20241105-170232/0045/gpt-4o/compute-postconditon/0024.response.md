The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10. After executing the function body, the function performs two cases:

Case_1: If the minimum sum `min_sum` calculated by `k * (k + 1) // 2` is greater than n, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Case_2: The function iterates through a loop to calculate a sequence of values based on `d` and `k`, incrementing the value at each index by 1 until `remainder` becomes 0. If `remainder` is already 0 or if `k` is 0, the loop does not execute. The final state includes updated values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` after the loop execution. The function returns `sequence`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate `min_sum` and perform a loop to generate a sequence of values based on `d` and `k`, returning the final sequence. If the minimum sum `min_sum` is greater than n, the function returns -1.
