Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers. `min_sum` is the result of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`. `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`. `sequence` is a list of values calculated based on `d` and `k`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. The value at index `i` in the `sequence` list is incremented by 1.**
