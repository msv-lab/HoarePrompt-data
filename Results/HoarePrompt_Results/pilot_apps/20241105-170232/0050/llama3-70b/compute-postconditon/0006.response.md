According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the only variable that needs adjustment is `i`, which should be set to 0 to indicate the start of the loop iteration.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers input by the user sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list containing the sorted integers input by the user in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0**
