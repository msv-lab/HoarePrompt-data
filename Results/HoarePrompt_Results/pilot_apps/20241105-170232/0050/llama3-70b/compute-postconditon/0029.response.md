Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. Since `shares` is 0, the value of `r` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is 0, `r` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`shares` is 0, `r` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1**
