Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in descending order using the `sort` method with the `reverse=True` parameter. The previous values of the list `b` are integers input by the user and converted to integers using the `map(int, input().split())` function. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers input by the user sorted in ascending order, and `b` is a list containing the sorted integers input by the user in descending order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers input by the user sorted in ascending order, and `b` is a list containing the sorted integers input by the user in descending order**
