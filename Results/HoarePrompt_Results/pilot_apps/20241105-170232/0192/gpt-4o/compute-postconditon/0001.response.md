Example Answer:
The expression calculates the difference between x and y, then performs integer division by 2 and adds the remainder of the division by 2. Since x and y are integers with the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result will always be a non-negative integer.
Output State: **The result of the expression is a non-negative integer**
