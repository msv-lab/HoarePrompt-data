Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing the input values, `a` is '0' with leading zeros stripped, `b` is '0'. If `b` is empty, it is assigned the value '0'. No changes are made to `b` or any other elements in `data`. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='.***
