```
1
3
1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case is similar to Test 11 but with the elements in a different order. It tests the edge case where the order of elements does not affect the MEX.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a small array with repeated elements and no 0. It tests the edge case where the array does not contain 0, and the MEX is 0.

**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 1

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
199999 199998 199997 ... 0 (199999 to 0)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the largest possible array with a complete sequence of consecutive integers in reverse order.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
199999 199999 199998 ... 0 (199999 repeated, then 199998 to 0)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the largest possible array with a repeated large element and a complete sequence of consecutive integers. It tests the edge case where the array is extremely large and the MEX is 1, as both players will remove elements in such a way that 0 is always included in the final array `c`.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
199999 199998 199997 ... 1 (199999 to 1)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the largest possible array with a complete sequence of consecutive integers starting from 1. It tests the edge case where the array does not contain 0, and the MEX is 0.

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the largest possible array with a complete sequence of consecutive integers starting from 1. It tests the edge case where the array does not contain 0, and the MEX is 0.

# Test 19
**Input**:

200000
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 (0 to 199998)
```
**Output**: 
```
199999
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the largest possible array with a complete sequence of consecutive integers missing the largest element. It tests the edge case where the MEX is the largest possible value, 199999.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 ... 199999 0 (1 to 199999, then 0)
```
**Output**: 
```
199999
```
**Scenario**: This test case is similar to Test 19 but with the elements in a different order. It tests the edge case where the MEX is the largest possible value, 199999.

These test cases should help ensure that the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable across a variety of input scenarios.
