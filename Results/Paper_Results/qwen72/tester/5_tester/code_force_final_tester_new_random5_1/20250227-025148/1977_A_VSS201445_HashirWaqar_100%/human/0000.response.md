4 2
6 4
8 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
Yes
Yes
```

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3
5 5
7 7
9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
Yes

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
10 5
12 6
14 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
Yes
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Cases where the number of moves is significantly larger than the target number of cubes, but still possible to achieve the target.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: Minimum number of moves (1) and a target number of cubes (2) that is impossible to achieve.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Minimum number of moves (2) and a target number of cubes (1) that is possible to achieve by removing one cube after adding one.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Maximum number of moves (100) and the target number of cubes (100) that is possible to achieve by adding one cube 100 times.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Maximum number of moves (100) and a very small target number of cubes (1) that is possible to achieve by adding and removing cubes in a specific sequence.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100 50
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Maximum number of moves (100) and a target number of cubes (50) that is possible to achieve by adding and removing cubes in a balanced sequence.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
99 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: Maximum number of moves (99) and a target number of cubes (100) that is impossible to achieve because the number of moves is less than the target number of cubes.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: Minimum number of moves (1) and a very large target number of cubes (100) that is impossible to achieve.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Minimum number of moves (2) and a target number of cubes (2) that is possible to achieve by adding one cube twice.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Odd number of moves (3) and an even target number of cubes (2) that is possible to achieve by adding one cube three times and then removing one.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: Even number of moves (4) and an odd target number of cubes (3) that is impossible to achieve because the parity of moves and target cubes does not match.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
50 50
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Equal number of moves and target cubes (50) that is possible to achieve by adding one cube 50 times.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
51 50
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Odd number of moves (51) and an even target number of cubes (50) that is possible to achieve by adding one cube 51 times and then removing one.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
52 51
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: Even number of moves (52) and an odd target number of cubes (51) that is impossible to achieve because the parity of moves and target cubes does not match.
