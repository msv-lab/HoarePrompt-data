Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- There is only one screenshot, and it is from user 1. The order [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is valid as user 1 sees himself at the top.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
4 4
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3 2 1 4
4 2 3 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The order [2, 3, 1, 4] is consistent with all screenshots. User 1 sees [1, 2, 3, 4], user 2 sees [2, 3, 1, 4], user 3 sees [3, 2, 1, 4], and user 4 sees [4, 2, 3, 1].

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
6 2
1 3 5 2 4 6
6 3 5 2 1 4
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The order [3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 6] is consistent with both screenshots. User 1 sees [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6], and user 6 sees [6, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4].

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
3 3
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The order [2, 3, 1] is consistent with all screenshots. User 1 sees [1, 2, 3], user 2 sees [2, 3, 1], and user 3 sees [3, 2, 1].

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
10 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The order [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1] is consistent with both screenshots. User 1 sees [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and user 10 sees [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
5 2
1 2 3 5 4
2 1 3 5 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- There is no consistent order that satisfies both screenshots. User 1 sees [1, 2, 3, 5, 4], but user 2 sees [2, 1, 3, 5, 4], which is not possible if user 1 is at the top in the first screenshot.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1 1
1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- There is only one user, and the order is trivially [1].

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
3 3
3 1 2
2 3 1
1 3 2
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- There is no consistent order that satisfies all three screenshots. User 3 sees [3, 1, 2], user 2 sees [2, 3, 1], and user 1 sees [1, 3, 2], which are not possible simultaneously.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
5 4
3 5 1 4 2
2 5 1 4 3
1 5 4 3 2
5 1 4 3 2
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- There is no consistent order that satisfies all four screenshots. The order [3, 5, 1, 4, 2] is inconsistent with the other orders.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
3 3
1 3 2
2 1 3
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- There is no consistent order that satisfies all three screenshots. User 1 sees [1, 3, 2], user 2 sees [2, 1, 3], and user 3 sees [3, 2, 1], which are not possible simultaneously.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
2 2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The order [1, 2] is consistent with both screenshots. User 1 sees [1, 2], and user 2 sees [2, 1].

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
10 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3
5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4
6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5
7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6
8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The order [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] is not consistent with the last screenshot, which shows [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
200000 1
1 2 3 4 5 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- There is only one screenshot, and it is from user 1. The order [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 200000] is valid as user 1 sees himself at the top.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
200000 200000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 200000
2 3 4 5 6 ... 1
3 4 5 6 7 ... 2
...
200000 1 2 3 4 ... 199999
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The order [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 200000] is consistent with all 200000 screenshots, each shifted by one position.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
200000 2
1 2 3 4 5 ... 200000
200000 1 2 3 4 ... 199999
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The order [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 200000] is consistent with both screenshots. User 1 sees [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 200000], and user 200000 sees [200000, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 199999].

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
200000 200000
