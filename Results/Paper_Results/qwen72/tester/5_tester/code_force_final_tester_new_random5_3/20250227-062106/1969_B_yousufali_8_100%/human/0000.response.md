```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a string of length 1. Although the problem specifies that the length of the string should be at least 2, it's important to handle this edge case to ensure the function doesn't crash or produce incorrect results.

**Input**: 
```
1
0101010101
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a long string with alternating 0s and 1s. It checks the function's ability to handle longer strings and ensure the correct minimum cost is calculated.

**Input**: 
```
1
1010101010
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case is similar to Test 6 but with the opposite alternating pattern. It ensures the function can handle different alternating patterns correctly.

**Input**: 
```
1
10000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
