# Test 1
**Input**:
```
4
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
35
```

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: Sticks have different lengths, but some combinations can form a non-degenerate triangle.

**Input**:
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Sticks have lengths 2, 4, and 8, which cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Only one stick is given, which is insufficient to form a triangle.

**Input**:
```
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Sticks have lengths 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, which cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

**Input**:
```
1
3
0 300000 300000
```
**Output**:

```
1
3
1 2 2
```
**Output**:
