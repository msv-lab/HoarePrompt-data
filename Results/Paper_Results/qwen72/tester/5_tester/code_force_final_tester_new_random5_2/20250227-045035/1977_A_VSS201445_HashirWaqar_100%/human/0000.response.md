**Scenario**: This test case checks the basic functionality with a few simple inputs. The first case is a straightforward "Yes" because 3 moves can result in 3 cubes. The second case is a "No" because 2 moves cannot result in 4 cubes. The third case is a "Yes" because 5 moves can result in 3 cubes (e.g., put 3 cubes, remove 2 cubes).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 4
```
**Output**:

**Input**: 
```
1
100 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100 and the number of cubes is 0. It should return "Yes" because it's possible to have 0 cubes after 100 moves (e.g., put 50 cubes, remove 50 cubes).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 1 and the number of cubes is 0. It should return "No" because it's impossible to have 0 cubes after 1 move.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where both the number of moves and the number of cubes are 0. It should return "Yes" because the tower starts with 0 cubes and no moves are made.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100 50
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100 and the number of cubes is 50. It should return "Yes" because it's possible to have 50 cubes after 100 moves (e.g., put 75 cubes, remove 25 cubes).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 2 and the number of cubes is 2. It should return "Yes" because it's possible to have 2 cubes after 2 moves (e.g., put 2 cubes).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 2 and the number of cubes is 1. It should return "Yes" because it's possible to have 1 cube after 2 moves (e.g., put 1 cube, remove 1 cube).

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 3 and the number of cubes is 2. It should return "Yes" because it's possible to have 2 cubes after 3 moves (e.g., put 2 cubes, remove 1 cube).

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 4 and the number of cubes is 2. It should return "No" because it's impossible to have exactly 2 cubes after 4 moves (e.g., put 2 cubes, remove 2 cubes results in 0 cubes).

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100 and the number of cubes is 99. It should return "Yes" because it's possible to have 99 cubes after 100 moves (e.g., put 100 cubes, remove 1 cube).

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
100 101
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100 and the number of cubes is 101. It should return "No" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 1 and the number of cubes is 2. It should return "No" because it's impossible to have 2 cubes after only 1 move.
