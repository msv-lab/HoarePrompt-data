YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior with the maximum number of containers (200,000) all containing the maximum possible amount of water (1,000,000,000). It should return "YES" as the containers are already equal.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 2000000000 0 2000000000 ... 0 2000000000 (100000 times 0 and 100000 times 2000000000)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior with the maximum number of containers (200,000) where half are empty and the other half contain the maximum possible amount of water (2,000,000,000). It should return "YES" as the water can be equalized to 1,000,000,000 units in each container.
