1
1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the permutation and array have only one element, and both players start at the same position. The game ends in a draw as both players have the same score.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 1000000000 1 2

```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the game lasts for the maximum number of turns (10^9), and both players start at different positions. The game ends in a draw as both players have the same score due to the large number of turns and high values in the array.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
200000 1 1 200000
200000 199999 199998 199997 ... 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
Bodya
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with the maximum length of the permutation (200000) and the game lasting for 1 turn. Bodya starts at the first position and wins due to a higher initial score.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
200000 1 200000 1
1 2 3 4 ... 200000
1 2 3 4 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with the maximum length of the permutation (200000) and the game lasting for 1 turn. Both players start at different positions but end up with the same score due to the symmetry in the permutation and array.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
2 1000000000 1 2
2 1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the game lasts for the maximum number of turns (10^9) and both players start at different positions. The game ends in a draw as both players have the same score due to the small and symmetric permutation and array.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 1 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the permutation is a reverse sequence and the array has all elements equal to 1. Both players start at different positions but end up with the same score due to the uniform array values.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 1 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1000000000 999999999 999999998 999999997 ... 1000000001
```
**Output**:
```
Bodya
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the permutation is a simple sequence and the array has very large values. Bodya starts at the first position and wins due to a higher initial score and the large values in the array.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 10 1
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the permutation is a reverse sequence and the array has increasing values. Sasha starts at the last position and wins due to a higher final score.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
100000 1 1 100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 2 1
1 2 3 ... 100000
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a large permutation (100000) and the game lasting for 1 turn. Both players start at different positions but end up with the same score due to the symmetry in the permutation and array.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
100000 100000 1 100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 2 1

```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a large permutation (100000) and the game lasting for 100000 turns. Sasha starts at the last position and wins due to a higher final score.

# Test 16

1
10 10 5 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```

```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the permutation is a reverse sequence and the array has increasing values. Sasha starts at the last position and wins due to a higher final score.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 10 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
