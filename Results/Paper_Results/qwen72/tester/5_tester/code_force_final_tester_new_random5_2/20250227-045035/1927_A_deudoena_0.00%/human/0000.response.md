### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1
B
```
**Output**:
```
1

10
BBBBBBBBBB
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the longest possible strip with all black cells.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
10
WWWWWWWWWW
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the longest possible strip with all white cells. Note that the problem guarantees at least one black cell, so this scenario is not valid but included for completeness.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
10
WBBWBBWBBW
```
**Output**:
```
7
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip where black cells are evenly distributed.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10
BWBWBWBWBW
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip where black and white cells alternate, requiring the entire strip to be painted.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10
WWWWWWWWBB
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip where black cells are at the very end.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10
BBWWWWWWWW
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip where black cells are at the very beginning.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
10
WBWBWBWBWB
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip where black and white cells alternate, but the strip starts and ends with a white cell.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
10
WBBWBBWBBW
```
**Output**:
```
7
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip where black cells are evenly distributed, but the strip starts and ends with a white cell.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
10
BWWBWWBWWB
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip where black cells are spaced out, requiring the entire strip to be painted.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
10
WBBWWBBWWB
```
**Output**:
```
7
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip with black cells in a more complex pattern, requiring a segment of length 7 to be painted.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.
