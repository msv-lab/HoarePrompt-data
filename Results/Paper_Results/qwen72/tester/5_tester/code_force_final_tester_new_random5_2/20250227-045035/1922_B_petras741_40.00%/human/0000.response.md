```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Sticks have lengths 2^1, 2^2, and 2^3. No three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because 2 + 4 is not greater than 8.

**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Sticks have lengths 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, and 2^6. No three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the two smallest lengths is not greater than the largest length.
