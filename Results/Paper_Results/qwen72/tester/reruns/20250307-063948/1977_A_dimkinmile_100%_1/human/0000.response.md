**Scenario**: Cases with larger values of `n` and `m` to ensure the function works for a broader range of inputs.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 1, but the desired number of cubes is 100. This is impossible as only one move can be made.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```

```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 100, but the desired number of cubes is 1. This is possible by making 100 moves, all of which are removing cubes.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is also 100. This is possible by making 100 moves, all of which are adding cubes.

100 50
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is 50. This is possible by making 75 moves to add cubes and 25 moves to remove cubes.

**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 1, and the desired number of cubes is also 1. This is the simplest possible case where one move adds one cube.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 2, and the desired number of cubes is 1. This is possible by adding one cube and then removing one cube.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 2, and the desired number of cubes is 2. This is possible by adding two cubes in a row.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 2, but the desired number of cubes is 3. This is impossible as only two moves can be made.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is 0. This is possible by making 100 moves, all of which are removing cubes.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 0, but the desired number of cubes is 1. This is impossible as no moves can be made.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 0, and the desired number of cubes is also 0. This is the base case where no moves are needed to achieve the desired state.

**Scenario**: A large number of test cases where `n` and `m` are equal. This ensures the function can handle a large number of test cases efficiently.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
100 101
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 100, but the desired number of cubes is 101. This is impossible as only 100 moves can be made.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is 99. This is possible by making 99 moves to add cubes and 1 move to remove a cube.
