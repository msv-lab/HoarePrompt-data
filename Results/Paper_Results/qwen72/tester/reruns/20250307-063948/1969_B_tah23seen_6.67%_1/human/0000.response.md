Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, divided into Basic and Edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
5
10
0000
11000
101011
01101001
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0
9
5
11
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a variety of basic scenarios, including a string that is already sorted, a string with a single cyclic shift, and strings that require multiple cyclic shifts.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
0101
1001
1110
```
**Output**: 
```
3
3
4
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes strings that require a few cyclic shifts to be sorted. It helps verify the function's ability to handle multiple operations efficiently.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
0011
1111
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a string that is almost sorted and a string that is already sorted. It ensures the function can handle minimal and zero-cost scenarios.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
4
0111
1011
1101
0001
```
**Output**: 
```
2
3
3
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes strings with a single '0' and multiple '1's, and vice versa. It helps verify the function's ability to handle strings with a small number of transitions.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
01
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the smallest possible input size (2 characters) where a cyclic shift is needed. It ensures the function can handle very small inputs correctly.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10101010101010101010
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a long alternating string. It helps verify the function's ability to handle large inputs and multiple transitions efficiently.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
00000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a long string of all '0's. It ensures the function can handle a large input that is already sorted.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
11111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a long string of all '1's. It ensures the function can handle a large input that is already sorted.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
01010101010101010101
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a long alternating string starting with '0'. It helps verify the function's ability to handle large inputs with multiple transitions efficiently.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a long string with a single '1' at the beginning. It ensures the function can handle large inputs with a single transition.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
00000000000000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a long string with a single '1' at the end. It ensures the function can handle large inputs with a single transition.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
