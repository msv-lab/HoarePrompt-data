```
azz
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a sum that can be achieved by a combination of the largest letter (z) and smaller letters to ensure the function can handle such cases and produce the correct output.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
100
```
**Output**:
```
Invalid input
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes an out-of-range sum (100) to ensure the function can handle invalid input and produce an appropriate error message.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
2
```
**Output**:
```
Invalid input
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes an out-of-range sum (2) to ensure the function can handle invalid input and produce an appropriate error message.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
100
3
```
**Output**:
```
aaa
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the maximum number of test cases (100) with the minimum possible sum (3) to ensure the function can handle the upper limit of test cases and produce the correct output.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
100
78
```
**Output**:
```
zzz
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the maximum number of test cases (100) with the maximum possible sum (78) to ensure the function can handle the upper limit of test cases and produce the correct output.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
5
```
**Output**:
```
aac
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a small sum (5) that can be achieved by a combination of the smallest letters to ensure the function can handle such cases and produce the correct output.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
76
```
