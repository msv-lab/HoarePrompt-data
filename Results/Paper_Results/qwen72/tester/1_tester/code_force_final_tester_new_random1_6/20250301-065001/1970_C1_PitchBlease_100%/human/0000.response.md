Sure, here are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem:

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a simple path of 3 nodes. The stone starts at the middle node (3). Ron can move the stone to either leaf (1 or 2), and Hermione will be forced to move to the other leaf, leaving Ron with no valid move.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 5 nodes. The stone starts at the leaf node (5). Hermione can always force Ron into a position where he has no valid move by moving the stone to the other leaf (1).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
2
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 4 nodes. The stone starts at the middle node (2). Ron can move the stone to either of the two middle nodes (1 or 3), and Hermione will be forced to move to the other middle node, leaving Ron with no valid move.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```

1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
3
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 6 nodes. The stone starts at the middle node (3). Ron can move the stone to either of the two middle nodes (2 or 4), and Hermione will be forced to move to the other middle node, leaving Ron with no valid move.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 2 nodes. The stone starts at one of the leaves (1). Hermione has no valid move, so Ron wins by default.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 2 nodes. The stone starts at the other leaf (2). Hermione has no valid move, so Ron wins by default.

3 4
...
99999 100000
1
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 100,000 nodes. The stone starts at one of the leaves (1). Hermione can always force Ron into a position where he has no valid move by moving the stone to the other leaf (100000).

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
50000
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 100,000 nodes. The stone starts at the middle node (50000). Ron can move the stone to either of the two middle nodes (49999 or 50001), and Hermione will be forced to move to the other middle node, leaving Ron with no valid move.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
100000
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 200,000 nodes. The stone starts at the middle node (100000). Ron can move the stone to either of the two middle nodes (99999 or 100001), and Hermione will be forced to move to the other middle node, leaving Ron with no valid move.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
1
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 200,000 nodes. The stone starts at one of the leaves (1). Hermione can always force Ron into a position where he has no valid move by moving the stone to the other leaf (200000).

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
200000
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 200,000 nodes. The stone starts at the other leaf (200000). Hermione can always force Ron into a position where he has no valid move by moving the stone to the other leaf (1).

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a path of 2 nodes. The stone starts at the other leaf (2). Hermione has no valid move, so Ron wins by default.
