Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone has 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off would deplete the charge to 0. Turning it off and on would cost 5 units, which is not possible.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
7 21 1 3
4 6 10 13 17 20 26
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 21 units of charge initially. It can send all messages without the charge dropping to 0, even if it is turned off and on between messages.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 10 units of charge initially. It can send all messages without the charge dropping to 0, even if it is turned off and on between messages.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 1,000,000,000 units of charge initially. Sending a message at moment 1,000,000,000 would deplete the charge to 0. Turning it off and on would cost 1,000,000,000 units, which is not possible.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 11 units of charge initially. Sending messages at moments 6, 8, and 10 would deplete the charge to 0 before the last message. Turning it off and on would cost 6 units, which is not sufficient.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
12 621526648 2585904 3566299
51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 621,526,648 units of charge initially. It can send all messages without the charge dropping to 0, even if it is turned off and on between messages.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1 1
1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 1 unit of charge initially. It can send the message at moment 1 without the charge dropping to 0.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 1 unit of charge initially. Sending the first message at moment 1 would deplete the charge to 0, making it impossible to send the second message at moment 2.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000 1 1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 1,000,000,000 units of charge initially. It can send the message at moment 1,000,000,000 without the charge dropping to 0.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1000000000 1
1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 1 unit of charge initially. The charge consumption per unit of time is 1,000,000,000, which means the phone will lose all its charge before moment 1.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 1 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 2 units of charge initially. It can send the first message at moment 1 and the second message at moment 2 without the charge dropping to 0.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 1 2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 2 units of charge initially. Sending the first message at moment 1 would leave 1 unit of charge, and turning it off and on would cost 2 units, making it impossible to send the second message at moment 2.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1 1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 1 unit of charge initially. The message needs to be sent at moment 1,000,000,000, which is impossible with the given charge.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
10 100 1 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 100 units of charge initially. It can send all messages without the charge dropping to 0, even if it is turned off and on between messages.

# Test 15

```
1
10 100 1 100
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 100 units of charge initially. Turning it off and on would cost 100 units, which is not possible without depleting the charge.

# Test 16

1
1 1000000000 1 1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 1,000,000,000 units of charge initially. It can send the message at moment 1,000,000,000 without the charge dropping to 0.

# Test 17

```
1
1 1 1000000000 1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 1 unit of charge initially. The charge consumption per unit of time is 1,000,000,000, which means the phone will lose all its charge before moment 1,000,000,000.

# Test 18
