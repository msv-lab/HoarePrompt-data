```
**Output**: 
```
144
```
**Scenario**: Basic case with a 10x10 board and 5 moves already played. The computer mirrors the first four moves, and the fifth move is a diagonal move, so the computer skips its turn. There are 144 possible configurations for the remaining moves.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 0
```
**Output**: 
```
16
```
**Scenario**: Basic case with a 5x5 board and no moves played. All possible configurations are valid, and there are 16 possible configurations for the remaining moves.

# Test 10
**Input**:

300 1
150 150
```
**Output**: 
```
2704156
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a 300x300 board and 1 move already played on the diagonal. The computer skips its turn, and there are 2704156 possible configurations for the remaining moves.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a 100x100 board and 100 moves already played. All rows and columns are occupied, so no more moves are possible, and the only configuration is the one already played.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a very large board size (100000x100000) and no moves played. The number of possible configurations is the maximum possible, which is 1000000000 modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
899999999
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a very large board size (300000x300000) and 1 move already played on the diagonal. The computer skips its turn, and the number of possible configurations is large, requiring modulo 10^9+7.
