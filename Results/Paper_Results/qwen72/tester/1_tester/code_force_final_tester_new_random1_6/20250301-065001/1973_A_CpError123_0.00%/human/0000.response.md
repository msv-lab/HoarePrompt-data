Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given chess game scoring problem. Each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.

### Basic Test Cases

```
7
0 0 0
0 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 2
3 3 3
3 4 5
1 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
-1
2
-1
6
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a variety of basic scenarios, including no games played, one draw, two draws, and a mix of wins and draws.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
2 2 2
4 4 4
6 6 6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
6
9
```
**Scenario**: All players have the same score, which can only be achieved if all games ended in draws.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 2
0 2 2
2 2 4
4 4 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
3
4
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers scenarios where the scores are multiples of 2, indicating a possible combination of wins and draws.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3
0 2 4
2 4 6
4 6 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2
4
6
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers scenarios where the scores are even and increasing by 2, indicating a possible combination of wins and draws.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It's impossible for one player to have 1 point while the others have 0 points, as a single point can only be obtained through a draw, which would require at least two players to have 1 point.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It's impossible for the scores to be 0, 1, and 2, as the only way to get a 1 is through a draw, which would require the other player to also have 1 point.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It's impossible for the scores to be 1, 2, and 3, as the only way to get a 1 is through a draw, which would require the other player to also have 1 point, and the scores cannot be achieved with the given constraints.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It's impossible for the scores to be 0, 2, and 3, as the only way to get a 2 is through a win, and the scores cannot be achieved with the given constraints.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 30
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It's impossible for one player to have 30 points while the others have 0 points, as the only way to get 30 points is through 15 wins, and the scores cannot be achieved with the given constraints.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Scenario**: All players have 10 points, which can only be achieved if all games ended in draws. The maximum number of draws is 15, as each draw gives 1 point to each player, and 10 points per player would require 15 draws.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
15 15 15
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
**Scenario**: All players have 15 points, which can only be achieved if all games ended in draws. The maximum number of draws is 22, as each draw gives 1 point to each player, and 15 points per player would require 22 draws (since 15 is not a multiple of 2, it's not possible, but the closest valid number of draws is 22).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 29
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It's impossible for one player to have 29 points while the others have 0 points, as 29 is an odd number and cannot be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 29
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It's impossible for one player to have 29 points while the others have 1 point, as the only way to get 1 point is through a draw, and the scores cannot be achieved with the given constraints.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 29
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It's impossible for one player to have 29 points while the others have 1 and 2 points, as the scores cannot be achieved with the given constraints.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 30
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Scenario**: The scores 1, 1, and 30 can be achieved if there were 14 draws and one player won all the remaining games. The maximum number of draws is 14.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It's impossible for one player to have 1 point while the others have 0 points, as a single point can only be obtained through a draw, which would require at least two players to have 1 point.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
0 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: The scores 0, 2, and 4 can be achieved if there were 2 draws and the player with 4 points won one game. The maximum number of draws is 2.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It's impossible for all players to have 1 point, as the only way to get 1 point is through a draw, and all players cannot have 1 point if there are only two players in each game.

# Test 21

```
1
0 0 2
```
**Output**:
