```
()()
```
**Explanation**: 
- The input sequence is a simple balanced sequence.
- The prefix balances are: 0, 1, 2, 1.
- Sorting the columns by prefix balance and then by position in decreasing order results in: 0, 1, 1, 2.
- The corresponding positions are: 1, 4, 2, 3.
- The output sequence is "(()())" which simplifies to "()()".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
()()
```
**Output**: 
```
()()
```
**Explanation**: 
- The input sequence is already balanced and in the simplest form.
- The prefix balances are: 0, 1, 0, 1.
- Sorting the columns by prefix balance and then by position in decreasing order results in: 0, 0, 1, 1.
- The corresponding positions are: 1, 3, 4, 2.
- The output sequence remains "(()())" which simplifies to "()()".

**Output**: 
```
()
```
**Explanation**: 
- The input sequence is the smallest possible balanced sequence.
- The prefix balances are: 0, 1.
