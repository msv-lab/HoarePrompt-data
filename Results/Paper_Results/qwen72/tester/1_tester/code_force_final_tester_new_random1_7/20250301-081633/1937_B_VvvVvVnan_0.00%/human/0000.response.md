### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2
11
11
```
**Output**:
```
111
1
```
**Explanation**: Both rows are filled with 1s, so the only possible path is the one that yields "111".

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2
01
10
```
**Output**:
```
001
1
```
**Explanation**: The lexicographically smallest path is to go right and then down, yielding "001".

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
10
0000000000
1111111111
```
**Output**:
```
00000000000
1
```
**Explanation**: The first row is entirely 0s, so the only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the first row.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10
1111111111
0000000000
```
**Output**:
```
00000000000
1
```
**Explanation**: The second row is entirely 0s, so the only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the second row.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10
0101010101
1010101010
```
**Output**:
```
00000000000
2
```
**Explanation**: The grid alternates between 0s and 1s in both rows, so there are two paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string "00000000000".

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
20
00000000000000000000
11111111111111111111
```
**Output**:
```
000000000000000000000
1
```
**Explanation**: The first row is entirely 0s, so the only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the first row.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
20
11111111111111111111
00000000000000000000
```
**Output**:
```
000000000000000000000
1
```
**Explanation**: The second row is entirely 0s, so the only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the second row.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
10
0111111111
0000000000
```
**Output**:
```
00000000000
1
```
**Explanation**: The second row is entirely 0s, so the only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the second row.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
10
1000000000
0111111111
```
**Output**:
```
00000000000
1
```
**Explanation**: The first row starts with a 1, but the second row starts with a 0, so the only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the second row.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
10
0111111111
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
00000000000
1
```
**Explanation**: The first row starts with a 0, and the second row starts with a 1, so the only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the first row.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
10
1111111111
0111111111
```
**Output**:
```
01111111111
1
```
**Explanation**: The second row starts with a 0, and the rest of the cells are 1s, so the only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to start in the second row and stay there.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
10
0111111111
1111111111
```
**Output**:
```
01111111111
1
```
**Explanation**: The first row starts with a 0, and the rest of the cells are 1s, so the only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to start in the first row and stay there.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
10
0000000001
1111111111
```
**Output**:
```
00000000011
1
```
**Explanation**: The first row is mostly 0s except for the last cell, which is a 1. The only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the first row until the last cell and then move down.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
10
1111111110
0000000000
```
**Output**:
```
00000000000
1
```
**Explanation**: The second row is entirely 0s, and the first row ends with a 0. The only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the second row.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
1
10
0000000001
1111111110
```
**Output**:
```
00000000001
1
```
**Explanation**: The first row is mostly 0s except for the last cell, which is a 1. The second row is mostly 1s except for the last cell, which is a 0. The only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the first row until the last cell and then move down.

# Test 21
**Input**:
```
1
10
1111111110
0000000001
```
**Output**:
```
00000000001
1
```
**Explanation**: The second row is mostly 0s except for the last cell, which is a 1. The first row is mostly 1s except for the last cell, which is a 0. The only path that yields the lexicographically smallest string is to stay in the second row until the last cell and then move up.

# Test 22
**Input**:
```
