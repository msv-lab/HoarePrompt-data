# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers 1, 2, and 3 can be grouped as follows: Group 1: [1, 2], Group 2: [3]. The binary representations are 001, 010, and 011 respectively, and they can be grouped such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit at any position from 1 to 31.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 2 4 8
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The numbers 1, 2, 4, and 8 can all be placed in the same group because their binary representations (0001, 0010, 0100, 1000) do not share any common bits in the same position.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 can be grouped as follows: Group 1: [1, 2, 4], Group 2: [3], Group 3: [5]. The binary representations are 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, and 0101 respectively, and they can be grouped such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit at any position from 1 to 31.

### Edge Test Cases
