### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 2. Only one swap is performed, and the position of 1 should be 2.

1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
500000000
```
