2 1 2 1 
3 1 3 1 2 
```
**Explanation**:
- For the first test case, placing a pinball on the 1st cell (">") moves it to the right and it leaves the grid in 1 second.
- Placing a pinball on the 2nd cell ("<") moves it to the left, then the 2nd cell becomes ">", and it moves to the right and leaves the grid in 4 seconds.
- Placing a pinball on the 3rd cell ("<") moves it to the left, then the 3rd cell becomes ">", and it moves to the right and leaves the grid in 3 seconds.

#### Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1
<
```
**Output**:
```
1 
```
**Explanation**:
- For a grid of length 1 with a single "<", the pinball will leave the grid in 1 second.

#### Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2
<<
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 
```
**Explanation**:
- For a grid of length 2 with both cells "<", the pinball will leave the grid in 1 second from the 1st cell and 2 seconds from the 2nd cell.

#### Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2
>>
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 
```
**Explanation**:
- For a grid of length 2 with both cells ">", the pinball will leave the grid in 1 second from the 1st cell and 2 seconds from the 2nd cell.

#### Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
10
><><><><><
```
**Output**:
```
2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 
```
**Explanation**:
- For a grid of length 10 alternating between "<" and ">", the pinball will oscillate between cells until it leaves the grid.

#### Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10
>>>>>>>>>>
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
```
**Explanation**:
- For a grid of length 10 with all cells ">", the pinball will move to the right and leave the grid in 1 to 10 seconds depending on the starting cell.

#### Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10
<<<<<<<<<<
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
```
**Explanation**:
- For a grid of length 10 with all cells "<", the pinball will move to the left and leave the grid in 1 to 10 seconds depending on the starting cell.

#### Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
500000
><><><><><... (repeating "<>" 250000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
2 1 2 1 2 1 ... (repeating "2 1" 250000 times)
```
**Explanation**:
- For a large grid of length 500000 alternating between "<" and ">", the pinball will oscillate between cells until it leaves the grid. This test case checks the scalability of the solution.

#### Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
500000
>>>>>>>>>>... (500000 ">"
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5 ... (1 to 500000)
```
**Explanation**:
- For a large grid of length 500000 with all cells ">", the pinball will move to the right and leave the grid in 1 to 500000 seconds depending on the starting cell. This test case checks the scalability of the solution.

#### Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
500000
<<<<<<<<<<... (500000 "<"
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5 ... (1 to 500000)
```
**Explanation**:
- For a large grid of length 500000 with all cells "<", the pinball will move to the left and leave the grid in 1 to 500000 seconds depending on the starting cell. This test case checks the scalability of the solution.

#### Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
500000
><><><><><... (repeating "><" 250000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
2 1 2 1 2 1 ... (repeating "2 1" 250000 times)
```
**Explanation**:
- For a large grid of length 500000 alternating between ">" and "<", the pinball will oscillate between cells until it leaves the grid. This test case checks the scalability of the solution.

#### Test 15
**Input**:
```

2 1 2 1 2 1 ... (repeating "2 1" 250000 times)
```
**Explanation**:
- This test case includes 100,000 test cases, each with a different grid configuration. The first few test cases are small grids, and the last test case is a large grid of length 500000 alternating between "<" and ">". This test case checks the robustness and scalability of the solution.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including small and large grids, grids with all cells pointing in the same direction, and grids with alternating directions. They are designed to ensure the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
