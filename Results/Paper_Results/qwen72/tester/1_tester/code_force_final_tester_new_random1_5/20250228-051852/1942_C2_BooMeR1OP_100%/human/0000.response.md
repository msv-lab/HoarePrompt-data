It seems there might be a mix-up in the problem description and the request for test cases. The problem description is about maximizing the number of triangular pieces of cake from a regular polygon, but the test case format you provided is for a different function, `has_close_elements`, which is not mentioned in the problem description. I will provide test cases for the cake cutting problem as described.
