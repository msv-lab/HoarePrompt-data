### Explanation:
- **Test 1**: Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which will empty all of the piles at once.
- **Test 2**: Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there is a pile of size 1, so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6.
- **Test 3**: Alice can choose k=1 on her first turn, and the game will continue with Bob being unable to make a move that doesn't leave Alice with a winning strategy.
- **Test 4**: Alice can choose k=1 on her first turn, and the game will continue with Bob being unable to make a move that doesn't leave Alice with a winning strategy.
- **Test 5**: Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn, and Bob can then choose k=1, leaving Alice with no winning move.
- **Test 6**: Alice can choose k=2 on her first turn, and the game will continue with Bob being unable to make a move that doesn't leave Alice with a winning strategy.
- **Test 7**: Alice can choose k=1000000000 on her first turn, which will empty the single pile and win the game.
