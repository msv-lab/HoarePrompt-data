**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the following coding problem. These test cases should encompass Basic and Edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

**Problem Description**:
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

**1. Basic Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To verify the fundamental functionality of the `has_close_elements` function under normal conditions.

**2. Edge Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To evaluate the function's behavior under extreme or unusual conditions.

**Instructions**:
- Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above.
- Ensure each test case is complete (no omission) and well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.
- Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs.
- Do not repeat, do not summarize.

All test cases you give need to strictly follow the problem description and format like this:
# Test 1
**Input**:

**Output**:
