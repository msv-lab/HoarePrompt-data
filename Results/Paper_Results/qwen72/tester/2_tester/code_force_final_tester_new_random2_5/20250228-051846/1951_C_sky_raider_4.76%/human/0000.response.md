It seems there was a mix-up in the problem description and the function name. The problem is about purchasing concert tickets with certain constraints, not about checking for close elements in a list. I'll provide the test cases for the concert ticket problem as requested.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: Basic case where the number of tickets to buy is less than the maximum tickets that can be bought in a single day. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket on the third day and 2 tickets on the fourth day.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 8
8 6 4 2
```
**Scenario**: The number of tickets to buy is exactly the maximum tickets that can be bought over the given days. The optimal strategy is to buy 2 tickets each day.
**Output**: 
```
64
```

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
```
**Scenario**: The number of tickets to buy is 1, and the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is very high. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket on the cheapest day.
**Output**: 
```
1
```

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3 9
5 5 5 5 5 5
```
**Scenario**: All ticket prices are the same, and the number of tickets to buy is exactly the maximum tickets that can be bought over the given days. The optimal strategy is to buy 3 tickets each day.
**Output**: 
```
72
```

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: Only one day to buy one ticket, and the ticket price is the maximum possible. The optimal strategy is to buy the ticket on the only available day.
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 3
1 2 3
```
**Scenario**: The number of tickets to buy is equal to the number of days, and the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is 1. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day.
**Output**: 
```
6
```

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Scenario**: The number of tickets to buy is equal to the number of days, and the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is 1. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day, starting from the cheapest day.
**Output**: 
```
55
```

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Scenario**: The number of tickets to buy is equal to the number of days, and the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is 10. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day, starting from the cheapest day.
**Output**: 
```
55
```

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000
1
```
**Scenario**: Only one day to buy a very large number of tickets, and the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is also very large. The optimal strategy is to buy all tickets on the only available day.
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```

```
**Scenario**: A very large number of days with a maximum of 1 ticket per day and a very large number of tickets to buy. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day, starting from the cheapest day.
**Output**: 
```
5000050000
