```
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- In the first test case, you have unique cards, so you cannot score any points.
- In the second test case, you have duplicate cards, and you can score 1 point if you play optimally.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3
6
1 1 2 2 3 3
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
6
1 1 2 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- In the first test case, you have all duplicate cards, and you can score 3 points.
- In the second test case, you have unique cards, so you cannot score any points.
- In the third test case, you have a mix of duplicate and unique cards, and you can score 2 points.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- This is the smallest possible input. You have only one card, and Nene will have the duplicate card. You cannot score any points.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- You have both cards with the same number. You can score 1 point by playing the second card after Nene places the first one.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- You have all unique cards, and Nene will have the duplicates. You cannot score any points.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: 
- You have all duplicate cards, and you can score 5 points by playing optimally.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 ... 100000 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: 
- This is the largest possible input. You have all duplicate cards, and you can score 100000 points by playing optimally.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- This is the largest possible input with all unique cards. Nene will have the duplicates, and you cannot score any points.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- This is an edge case where some numbers appear more than twice in your hand. However, the problem guarantees that each number appears at most twice, so this scenario is invalid. The test case is included to ensure the code handles such invalid inputs gracefully.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- You have all unique cards, and Nene will have the duplicates. You cannot score any points.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: 
- You have all duplicate cards, and you can score 5 points by playing optimally.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: 
- You have a mix of duplicate and unique cards. You can score 4 points by playing optimally.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: 
- This is a repeat of Test 12 to ensure consistency in handling duplicate cards.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- This is a repeat of Test 11 to ensure consistency in handling unique cards.
