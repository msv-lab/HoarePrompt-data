Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
6
2 1
3 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: Basic case with a small number of players and a simple sequence. The sequence [3, 5] is applied to 5 players, resulting in 2 winners.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
3 5
10 20 30
```
**Output**: 
```
7 12 20
```
**Scenario**: Multiple values of `n` with a small sequence. The sequence [3, 5] is applied to 10, 20, and 30 players, resulting in 7, 12, and 20 winners respectively.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
2 4 6
8
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: Sequence with more elements applied to a small number of players. The sequence [2, 4, 6] is applied to 8 players, resulting in 2 winners.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Scenario**: Sequence with only one element (1) applied to multiple small values of `n`. Since the first player is always kicked out, no one wins in any of the cases.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 3 5 7
10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Scenario**: Sequence with multiple odd elements applied to a small number of players. The sequence [1, 3, 5, 7] is applied to 10 players, resulting in 6 winners.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
100
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Sequence with all possible elements (1 to 100) applied to 100 players. Since every player is kicked out in the first round, no one wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
100
100
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Sequence with only one element (1) applied to the maximum number of players (100). Since the first player is always kicked out, no one wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 91 93 95 97 99
100
```
**Output**: 
```
50
```
**Scenario**: Sequence with all odd elements (1 to 99) applied to 100 players. Since only even-indexed players remain, 50 players win.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 100
100
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Sequence with all possible elements (1 to 100) applied to 100 players, but in a different order. Since every player is kicked out in the first round, no one wins.

100
```
**Output**: 
```
50
```
**Scenario**: Sequence with all even elements (2 to 100) applied to 100 players. Since only odd-indexed players remain, 50 players win.
