0 9 1
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the smallest possible value for the first and third digits, and the largest possible value for the second digit, forming a peak.

```
NONE
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the largest possible value for the first and third digits, and the smallest possible value for the second digit, which should not form a stair or a peak.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the smallest possible value for the first digit and the largest possible value for the last two digits, which should not form a stair or a peak.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
9 9 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the largest possible value for the first two digits and the smallest possible value for the third digit, which should not form a stair or a peak.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
0 9 8
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the smallest possible value for the first digit, the largest possible value for the second digit, and a value one less than the largest for the third digit, forming a peak.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
8 9 0
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a value one less than the largest for the first digit, the largest possible value for the second digit, and the smallest possible value for the third digit, forming a peak.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 9
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the smallest possible value for the first two digits and the largest possible value for the third digit, which should not form a stair or a peak.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
9 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the largest possible value for the first digit and the smallest possible value for the last two digits, which should not form a stair or a peak.
