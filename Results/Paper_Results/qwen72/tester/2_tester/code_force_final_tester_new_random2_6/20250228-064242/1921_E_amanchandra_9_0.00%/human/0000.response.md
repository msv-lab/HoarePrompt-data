Sure, here are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios:

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts in the middle of the board and can move towards Bob's chip, which is closer to the bottom. Bob has fewer options to avoid Alice.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 2 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: The board is very narrow (only 1 column), and Alice starts in the middle while Bob is at the bottom. Bob can force Alice into a corner.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 1 4 5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts at the top and Bob at the bottom. They are far apart and cannot reach each other before one of them is blocked.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts at the top-left corner and Bob at the bottom-right corner. They are diagonally opposite and cannot meet.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1 6 10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts near the top and Bob near the bottom. Alice can move diagonally to catch Bob.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: The board has only one row, and Alice starts in the third column while Bob starts in the first column. Neither can move, so the game ends in a draw.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 2 6 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts in the second row and Bob in the tenth row. They are far apart and cannot meet before one of them is blocked.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 9 1 8 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts in the ninth row and Bob in the eighth row, both in the first column. They are very close but cannot meet because they are in the same column and cannot move diagonally to each other.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 8 1 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts in the eighth row and Bob in the tenth row. Bob can move diagonally to catch Alice before Alice can reach the bottom.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts in the first row and Bob in the second row, both in the first column. Alice can move down to catch Bob on her first move.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1 3 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts in the first row and Bob in the fourth row. Alice can move diagonally to catch Bob.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 3 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts in the third row and Bob in the first row, both in the first column. Bob cannot move, and Alice cannot reach Bob before she is blocked.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000000 1 1 1000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts at the top-left corner and Bob at the bottom-right corner of a very large board. They are too far apart to meet.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000000 1 500000000 1000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts in the middle of the first row and Bob in the middle of the last row. They are directly aligned but cannot meet due to the large board size.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000000 1 1 1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice and Bob start in the same column but at opposite ends of a very large board. They cannot meet due to the board size.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000000 500000 500000000 500001 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice and Bob start in adjacent rows and the same column in the middle of a very large board. They cannot meet due to the board size and their starting positions.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000000 500000 1 500001 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Alice and Bob start in adjacent rows and adjacent columns in the middle of a very large board. Bob can move diagonally to catch Alice.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000000 500000 1 500001 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice and Bob start in adjacent rows and the same column in the middle of a very large board. They cannot meet due to the board size and their starting positions.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000000 1 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts in the first row and Bob in the second row, both in the first column. Alice can move down to catch Bob on her first move.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000000 1 1 1000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts at the top-left corner and Bob at the bottom-right corner of a very large board. They are too far apart to meet.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including small and large board sizes, various starting positions, and edge cases where players are at the boundaries of the board.
