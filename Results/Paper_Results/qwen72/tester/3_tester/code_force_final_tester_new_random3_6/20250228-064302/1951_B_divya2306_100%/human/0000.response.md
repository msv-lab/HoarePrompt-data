**Scenario**: This test case covers the example provided in the problem description. It tests the basic functionality of the solution with multiple test cases.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
5 3
5 1 10 2 8
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a simple scenario where the cow in position 3 has a moderate rating. The optimal swap is to position 2, allowing the cow to win two matches.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
4 2
10 20 30 40
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the cow in position 2 has a low rating compared to the subsequent cows. The optimal strategy is to do nothing, as the cow will not win any matches.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
4 1
100 50 25 75
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the cow in position 1 has a high rating. The optimal strategy is to swap with the cow in position 2, allowing the cow to win two matches.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the smallest possible input size (n = 2). The cow in position 1 has a lower rating than the cow in position 2, so it will not win any matches.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the smallest possible input size (n = 2) with the cow in position 2 having a higher rating. The cow will win the only match.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
100000 50000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 100000
```
**Output**:
```
49999
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the largest possible input size (n = 100000) with a cow in the middle (k = 50000). The ratings are in increasing order, so the optimal strategy is to swap the cow to position 1, allowing it to win 49999 matches.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
100000 1
100000 99999 99998 99997 ... 1
```
**Output**:
```
99999
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the largest possible input size (n = 100000) with the cow in the first position (k = 1) having the highest rating. The cow will win all 99999 matches.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
100000 100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 100000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the largest possible input size (n = 100000) with the cow in the last position (k = 100000) having the lowest rating. The cow will not win any matches.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10 1
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
9
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the ratings are in decreasing order, and the cow in position 1 has the highest rating. The cow will win all 9 matches.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the ratings are in increasing order, and the cow in position 10 has the lowest rating. The cow will not win any matches.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
10 5
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the ratings are in decreasing order, and the cow in position 5 has a moderate rating. The optimal strategy is to swap the cow to position 1, allowing it to win 5 matches.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
10 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the ratings are in increasing order, and the cow in position 5 has a moderate rating. The optimal strategy is to swap the cow to position 1, allowing it to win 5 matches.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
10 1
5 10 9 8 7 6 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the cow in position 1 has a moderate rating, and the subsequent ratings are in decreasing order. The optimal strategy is to swap the cow to position 2, allowing it to win 4 matches.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
10 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the cow in position 10 has the highest rating, and the ratings are in decreasing order. The cow will not win any matches because it is in the last position.

These test cases should help ensure that the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable across a variety of scenarios.
