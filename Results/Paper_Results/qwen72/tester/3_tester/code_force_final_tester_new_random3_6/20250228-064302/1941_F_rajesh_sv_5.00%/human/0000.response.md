```
**Output**:
```
999999999
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with the minimum number of problems (2), but the maximum number of models and functions (200,000 each). The imbalance cannot be reduced further.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
100000 1 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 100000
1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with the maximum number of problems (100,000), but only one very large model and function. The imbalance is already minimal and cannot be reduced further.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1
1 1000000000
1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the only model and function can create a problem with the same complexity as the existing problems, resulting in zero imbalance.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
5 1 1
5 10 15 20 25

1
```
**Output**:
