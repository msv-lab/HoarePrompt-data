It seems there was a mix-up in the function name and the problem description. The problem is about Sasha's betting strategy at a casino, not about a function called `has_close_elements`. I will provide the test cases for the casino betting problem as requested.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (1) and can only lose once in a row. This is the smallest possible input for `a`.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (1) but can lose up to 100 times in a row. This is the maximum possible value for `x`.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
30 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (1) and the maximum possible value for `k` (30), but can only lose once in a row.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the maximum initial coins (1,000,000,000) but can only lose once in a row. This is the largest possible input for `a`.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the maximum initial coins (1,000,000,000) and the maximum possible value for `x` (100).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
30 100 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the maximum initial coins (1,000,000,000), the maximum possible value for `k` (30), and the maximum possible value for `x` (100).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (2) and can only lose once in a row. This is the smallest possible input for `a` that allows for a "YES" output.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (2) and can lose up to 2 times in a row. This is a critical boundary case for `x`.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (2) and can lose up to 100 times in a row. This tests the upper limit of `x` with the minimum `a` that allows for a "YES" output.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
30 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (2) and the maximum possible value for `k` (30), but can only lose once in a row. This tests the upper limit of `k` with the minimum `a` that allows for a "YES" output.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (3) and can only lose once in a row. This is another critical boundary case for `a`.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (4) and can only lose once in a row. This is another critical boundary case for `a`.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (5) and can only lose once in a row. This is another critical boundary case for `a`.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 6
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (6) and can only lose once in a row. This is another critical boundary case for `a`.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha has the minimum initial coins (7) and can only lose once in a row. This is another critical boundary case for `a`.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including the minimum and maximum values for `k`, `x`, and `a`, as well as critical boundary cases that can help ensure the robustness and reliability of the solution.
