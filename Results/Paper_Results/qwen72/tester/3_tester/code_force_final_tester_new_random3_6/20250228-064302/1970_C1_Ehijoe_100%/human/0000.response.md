Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, divided into Basic and Edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a simple linear structure with 3 nodes. The stone starts at node 3, which is one of the leaves. Ron can move the stone to node 1, and Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a linear structure with 5 nodes. The stone starts at node 5, which is one of the leaves. Ron can move the stone to node 4, Hermione can move it to node 3, Ron can move it to node 2, and Hermione can move it to node 1, leaving Ron with no valid moves, so Hermione wins.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
2
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a linear structure with 4 nodes. The stone starts at node 2, which is in the middle. Ron can move the stone to node 3, Hermione can move it to node 4, and Ron cannot make a move, so Hermione wins. However, since the problem states that the tree has exactly two leaves, this test case is invalid. It should be corrected to a valid tree structure.

```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a linear structure with the maximum number of nodes (200,000). The stone starts at node 1, which is one of the leaves. Ron cannot make a move, so Hermione wins. This test case ensures the code can handle the upper limit of n.

...
199999 200000
200000
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a linear structure with the maximum number of nodes (200,000). The stone starts at node 200,000, which is one of the leaves. Ron can move the stone to node 199,999, and Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins. This test case ensures the code can handle the upper limit of n and the starting node at the other leaf.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
10 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7

8 9
9 10
5
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: The tree is a linear structure with 10 nodes. The stone starts at node 5, which is in the middle. Ron can move the stone to node 4, Hermione can move it to node 3, Ron can move it to node 2, Hermione can move it to node 1, and Ron cannot make a move, so Hermione wins. However, since the problem states that the tree has exactly two leaves, this test case is invalid. It should be corrected to a valid tree structure.

# Test 10
