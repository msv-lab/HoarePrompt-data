# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WWWWWWWWWWB
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when only the last cell is black and the rest are white, ensuring the minimum segment length is correctly identified.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WBWBWBWBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the strip alternates between black and white cells, ensuring the entire strip is painted.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BBBBBWWWWWW
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the strip has a large segment of white cells at the end, ensuring the entire black segment is painted.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WWWWWWBBBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the strip has a large segment of white cells at the beginning, ensuring the entire black segment is painted.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BWWBWWBWWB
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the strip has multiple small black segments, ensuring the minimum segment length is correctly identified.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BWWWWWWWWB
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the strip has black cells at both ends and a large white segment in the middle, ensuring the minimum segment length is correctly identified.

10
WWBWWBWWBWW
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the strip has multiple small black segments with white cells in between, ensuring the minimum segment length is correctly identified, even though the strip length exceeds the maximum allowed (10 cells). This should be handled gracefully.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BWBWBWBWBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the strip alternates between black and white cells and the length exceeds the maximum allowed (10 cells). This should be handled gracefully.

These test cases should help ensure that the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
