# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2 15 30
```
**Output**:
```
30
```

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
100 30 30
```
**Output**:

100 15 29
```
**Output**:
```
1450
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where `n` is at its maximum value, and the promotion price is just slightly less than twice the regular price. The expected output is a mix of promotion and regular prices.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
100 15 31
```
**Output**:
