2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Scenario**: A case with two 1s, two 2s, and two 3s. Bob wins three times as Eve can remove pairs of numbers to ensure the XOR remains zero.

# Test 4

```
0 1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: A sequence with only one 2. Bob cannot win as the XOR is non-zero from the start.

# Test 9

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: A sequence with only one 4. Bob cannot win as the XOR is non-zero from the start.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
200 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
199
```
**Scenario**: A sequence with 200 ones. Bob wins 199 times as Eve can remove 199 ones, leaving one 1 at the end.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
0 200 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
199
```
**Scenario**: A sequence with 200 twos. Bob wins 199 times as Eve can remove 199 twos, leaving one 2 at the end.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
0 0 200 0
```
**Output**: 
```
199
```
**Scenario**: A sequence with 200 threes. Bob wins 199 times as Eve can remove 199 threes, leaving one 3 at the end.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
0 0 0 200
```
**Output**: 
```
199
```
**Scenario**: A sequence with 200 fours. Bob wins 199 times as Eve can remove 199 fours, leaving one 4 at the end.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
100 100 100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
199
```
**Scenario**: A balanced sequence with 100 of each number. Bob wins 199 times as Eve can remove pairs of numbers to ensure the XOR remains zero.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Scenario**: A small balanced sequence with one of each number. Bob wins three times as Eve can remove pairs of numbers to ensure the XOR remains zero.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: A sequence with only one 4. Bob cannot win as the XOR is non-zero from the start.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1 1 0 0
