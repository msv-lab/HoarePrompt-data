0 0 2
0 0 4
0 0 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
3
```
**Scenario**: One player has zero points, and the other two have even scores, which can be achieved with draws and one player winning all non-draw games.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
2 2 4
4 4 8
6 6 12
```
**Output**: 
```
3
6
9
```
**Scenario**: Two players have the same score, and the third has double that score, which can be achieved with a mix of draws and one player winning all non-draw games.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It is impossible for one player to have 1 point while the other two have 0 points, as a single game would result in either 2 points for the winner or 1 point each in a draw.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It is impossible for the scores to be 0, 1, and 2, as the only way to get 1 point is through a draw, and the scores would not be consistent with the given constraints.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: One game ended in a draw, and the other game was won by the player with 2 points.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
30 30 30
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
**Scenario**: The maximum possible number of draws when all players have the highest possible score, which is 30. This can be achieved if all 45 games ended in draws.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 30
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Scenario**: One player has 30 points, and the other two have 0 points. This can be achieved if the player with 30 points won all 15 games.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 30
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It is impossible for one player to have 30 points, another to have 1 point, and the third to have 0 points, as the scores would not be consistent with the given constraints.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 30
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Scenario**: One player has 30 points, and the other two have 1 point each. This can be achieved if the player with 30 points won 14 games and drew one game.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
15 15 15
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
**Scenario**: All players have 15 points, which can be achieved if 22 games ended in draws and the remaining 1 game was won by one player.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
0 15 30
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Scenario**: One player has 30 points, one has 15 points, and one has 0 points. This can be achieved if the player with 30 points won 15 games and the player with 15 points drew all 15 games.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1 15 30
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Scenario**: One player has 30 points, one has 15 points, and one has 1 point. This can be achieved if the player with 30 points won 14 games, drew one game, and the player with 15 points drew all 15 games.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It is impossible for all players to have 1 point, as the only way to get 1 point is through a draw, and the scores would not be consistent with the given constraints.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
0 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: One player has 4 points, one has 2 points, and one has 0 points. This can be achieved if the player with 4 points won 2 games and the player with 2 points drew both games.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 29
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It is impossible for one player to have 29 points while the other two have 0 points, as the scores would not be consistent with the given constraints.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
0 29 30
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: It is impossible for one player to have 30 points, another to have 29 points, and the third to have 0 points, as the scores would not be consistent with the given constraints.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 29
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Scenario**: One player has 29 points, one has 1 point, and one has 1 point. This can be achieved if the player with 29 points won 14 games, drew one game, and the other two players drew the remaining game.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, to ensure the function's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
