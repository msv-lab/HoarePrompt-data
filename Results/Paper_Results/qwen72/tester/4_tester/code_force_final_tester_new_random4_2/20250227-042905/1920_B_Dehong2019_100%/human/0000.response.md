Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest two elements (1, 2). Bob can then multiply the smallest two elements of the remaining array (3, 4) by -1. The final array is [3, 4, 5] with a sum of 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. However, Bob will multiply 3 and 4 by -1, resulting in [-3, -4, 5] with a sum of -3 - 4 + 5 = -2. Alice should remove 1 and 2, and Bob will multiply 3 and 4 by -1, resulting in 5 - 3 - 4 = -2. But the optimal strategy is for Alice to remove 1 and 3, and Bob to multiply 2 and 4 by -1, resulting in 5 - 2 - 4 = -1. The correct sum is 11.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 1
10 20 30
```
**Output**: 
```
50
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest element (10). Bob will then multiply the smallest remaining element (20) by -1. The final array is [20, 30] with a sum of 20 + 30 = 50.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove two elements (5, 5). Bob will then multiply the remaining two elements (5, 5) by -1. The final array is [5, 5] with a sum of 5 + 5 = 10.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3 2
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest three elements (1, 2, 3). Bob will then multiply the smallest two elements of the remaining array (4, 5) by -1. The final array is [4, 5, 6] with a sum of 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. However, Bob will multiply 4 and 5 by -1, resulting in -4 - 5 + 6 = -3. The correct sum is 12.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest four elements (1, 2, 3, 4). Bob will then multiply the smallest three elements of the remaining array (5, 6, 7) by -1. The final array is [5, 6, 7, 8] with a sum of 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26. However, Bob will multiply 5, 6, and 7 by -1, resulting in -5 - 6 - 7 + 8 = -10. The correct sum is 15.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove the only element (1). The final array is empty with a sum of 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove both elements (4, 3). The final array is empty with a sum of 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest element (1). Bob will then multiply the remaining element (3) by -1. The final array is [3] with a sum of 3. However, Bob will multiply 3 by -1, resulting in -3. The correct sum is -1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove all elements. The final array is empty with a sum of 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest five elements (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Bob will then multiply the smallest five elements of the remaining array (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) by -1. The final array is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] with a sum of 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 40. However, Bob will multiply 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 by -1, resulting in -6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 = -40. The correct sum is 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000 100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (200000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove 100000 elements. Bob will then multiply the remaining 100000 elements by -1. The final array is [1, 1, 1, ..., 1] (100000 times) with a sum of 100000. However, Bob will multiply all 100000 elements by -1, resulting in -100000. The correct sum is 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 1 1
1 2 3 ... 1000 (200 times) ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
10000100000
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest element (1). Bob will then multiply the smallest remaining element (2) by -1. The final array is [2, 3, 4, ..., 100000] with a sum of 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 100000 = 5000050000. However, Bob will multiply 2 by -1, resulting in -2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 100000 = 5000050000 - 2 = 5000049998. The correct sum is 10000100000.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000 1
1 2 3 ... 1000 (200 times) ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
5000050000
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove 100000 elements. Bob will then multiply the smallest remaining element (100001) by -1. The final array is [100001, 100002, ..., 200000] with a sum of 100001 + 100002 + ... + 200000 = 15000150000. However, Bob will multiply 100001 by -1, resulting in -100001 + 100002 + ... + 200000 = 15000150000 - 100001 = 15000050000 - 100001 = 5000050000. The correct sum is 5000050000.
