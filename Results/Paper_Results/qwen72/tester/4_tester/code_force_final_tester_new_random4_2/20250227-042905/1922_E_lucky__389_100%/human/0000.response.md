```
20
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
```
**Description**: This test case checks a very large value of X that is still within the range. The function should generate an array of length 20 that has exactly 1,000,000,000 increasing subsequences.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```

3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0 1
```

**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0 1

**Description**: This test case checks a value of X (4) that is slightly larger than the smallest valid value. The output is a two-element array that has exactly 4 increasing subsequences (empty, [0], [1], and [0, 1]).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the largest possible value of X (10^18) to ensure the function can handle it correctly. The function should return -1 if it is impossible to find a valid array.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the largest possible value of X (10^18) again to ensure consistency in handling large values. The function should return -1 if it is impossible to find a valid array.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the largest possible value of X (10^18) one more time to ensure the function is robust and consistent in handling large values. The function should return -1 if it is impossible to find a valid array.

```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks a value of X (201) that is just above the maximum possible number of increasing subsequences for an array of length 200. The function should return -1 as it is impossible to find a valid array.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks a value of X (2 * 10^18) that is well above the upper limit. The function should return -1 as it is impossible to find a valid array.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks a value of X (0) that is below the lower limit. The function should return -1 as it is impossible to find a valid array.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the upper boundary value of X (10^18) again to ensure the function is consistent in handling large values. The function should return -1 if it is impossible to find a valid array.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the upper boundary value of X (10^18) one more time to ensure the function is robust and consistent in handling large values. The function should return -1 if it is impossible to find a valid array.
