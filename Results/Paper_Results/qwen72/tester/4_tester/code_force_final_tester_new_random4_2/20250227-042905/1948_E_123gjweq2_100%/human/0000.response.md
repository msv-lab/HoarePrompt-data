**Input**: 
```
1
40 80
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40

```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum possible value for `n` with a very large `k` value. The graph will be fully connected, so it can be partitioned into a single clique.

```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where `n` and `k` are equal. The graph will be fully connected, so it can be partitioned into a single clique.

10 20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
