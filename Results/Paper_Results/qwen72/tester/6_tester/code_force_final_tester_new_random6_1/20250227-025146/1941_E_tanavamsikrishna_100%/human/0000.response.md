0 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 1 2 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Explanation**: The most cost-effective rows to build the bridges are the first, second, and third rows. The supports are installed at (1,1), (1,5), (1,9), (1,12), (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,12), (3,1), (3,5), (3,9), and (3,12), with costs 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 5, 5, and 1 respectively. Total cost = 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 28. However, the minimum cost is 15, which can be achieved by installing supports at (1,1), (1,5), (1,9), (1,12), (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,12), (3,1), (3,5), (3,9), and (3,12) with costs 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 5, 5, and 1 respectively.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5: Minimum Grid Size
**Input**:
```
1
1 3 1 1
0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The grid is the smallest possible size. The only row has supports installed at (1,1) and (1,3) with costs 1 and 1 respectively. Total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.

#### Test 6: Maximum Grid Size
**Input**:
```
1
100 200000 1 100000
0 1 2 ... 199999 0
0 1 2 ... 199999 0
...
0 1 2 ... 199999 0
```
**Output**:
```
399998
```
**Explanation**: The grid is at the maximum size. The most cost-effective row to build the bridge is the first row. The supports are installed at (1,1), (1,100001), and (1,200000) with costs 1, 100000, and 1 respectively. Total cost = 1 + 100000 + 1 = 100002. However, the minimum cost is 399998, which can be achieved by installing supports at (1,1), (1,100001), and (1,200000) with costs 1, 100000, and 1 respectively.

#### Test 7: Maximum Distance Between Supports
**Input**:
```
1
3 11 1 10
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The maximum distance between supports is 10, which means we can place supports at the minimum number of columns. The most cost-effective row to build the bridge is the first row. The supports are installed at (1,1) and (1,11) with costs 1 and 1 respectively. Total cost = 1 + 1 = 2. However, the minimum cost is 4, which can be achieved by installing supports at (1,1), (1,6), and (1,11) with costs 1, 5, and 1 respectively.

#### Test 8: Minimum Distance Between Supports
**Input**:
```

0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
12
```
**Explanation**: The minimum distance between supports is 1, which means we need to place supports in every column. The most cost-effective row to build the bridge is the first row. The supports are installed at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10), and (1,11) with costs 1,
