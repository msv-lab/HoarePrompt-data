Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios:

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
6
0 1 0 0 0 0
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
5
1 0 1 0 1
9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
0
0
2
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a variety of basic scenarios with different lengths of ribbons and different chip placements. It ensures that the function can handle typical input and produce the correct minimum number of operations.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
3
4
0 1 0 1
5
0 0 1 1 0
7
1 0 0 1 0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
1
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes ribbons with a small number of cells and chips that are not initially in a single block. It checks the function's ability to handle smaller inputs and verify the correctness of the minimum operations.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
4
3
0 1 1
4
1 0 0 1
5
1 0 1 0 1
6
1 1 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
1
2
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes ribbons with varying chip placements, including cases where chips are already in a single block and cases where they are not. It ensures the function can handle different chip distributions and compute the correct minimum operations.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the smallest possible ribbon with only two cells, both containing chips. It checks the function's behavior when the ribbon is already in the desired state.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
50
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a ribbon with the maximum number of cells (50) and only one chip at the far right. It checks the function's behavior when there are no free cells to the left of the chip.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
50
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a ribbon with the maximum number of cells (50) and only one chip at the far left. It checks the function's behavior when the chip is already in the leftmost position.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
50
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
49
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a ribbon with the maximum number of cells (50) and chips at the far left and far right. It checks the function's behavior when the chips are as far apart as possible, requiring the maximum number of operations.

# Test 8
**Input**:
