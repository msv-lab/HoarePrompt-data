Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 3 nodes (1-3-2). Starting from node 3, Ron can move the stone to node 1, and Hermione will have no valid move left, so Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 5 nodes (1-2-3-4-5). Starting from node 5, Ron can move the stone to node 4, Hermione can move it to node 3, Ron can move it to node 2, and Hermione can move it to node 1. Ron will have no valid move left, so Hermione wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 4 nodes (1-2-3-4). Starting from node 2, Ron can move the stone to node 1 or node 3. If Ron moves to node 1, Hermione can move it to node 2, and Ron will have no valid move left. If Ron moves to node 3, Hermione can move it to node 4, and Ron will have no valid move left. In both cases, Hermione wins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 6 nodes (1-2-3-4-5-6). Starting from node 4, Ron can move the stone to node 3 or node 5. If Ron moves to node 3, Hermione can move it to node 2, Ron can move it to node 1, and Hermione will have no valid move left. If Ron moves to node 5, Hermione can move it to node 6, and Ron will have no valid move left. In both cases, Ron wins.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 2 nodes (1-2). Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and Hermione will have no valid move left, so Ron wins. However, the problem states that the tree has exactly two leaves, so this test case is not valid. It should be noted that the input is incorrect.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 2 nodes (1-2). Starting from node 2, Ron can move the stone to node 1, and Hermione will have no valid move left, so Ron wins. However, the problem states that the tree has exactly two leaves, so this test case is not valid. It should be noted that the input is incorrect.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
50000
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 100,000 nodes. Starting from node 50,000, Ron can move the stone to node 49,999 or 50,001. This test case checks the function's performance with a large number of nodes.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 200,000 nodes. Starting from node 100,000, Ron can move the stone to node 99,999 or 100,001. This test case checks the function's performance with the maximum number of nodes.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 2 nodes (1-2). Starting from node 2, Ron can move the stone to node 1, and Hermione will have no valid move left, so Ron wins. This test case checks the behavior when the tree is at the minimum size.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 200,000 nodes. Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, Hermione can move it to node 3, and so on. Ron will eventually be forced to move the stone to node 200,000, and Hermione will have no valid move left, so Hermione wins. This test case checks the behavior when the starting node is one of the leaves.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
200000
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 200,000 nodes. Starting from node 200,000, Ron can move the stone to node 199,999, and Hermione will have no valid move left, so Ron wins. This test case checks the behavior when the starting node is the other leaf.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 3 nodes (1-2-3). Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, Hermione can move it to node 3, and Ron will have no valid move left, so Hermione wins. This test case checks the behavior when the starting node is a leaf.

# Test 13

```
3 1
1 2
2 3
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path of 3 nodes (1-2-3). Starting from node 2, Ron can move the stone to node 1 or node 3. If Ron moves to node 1, Hermione can move it to node 2, and Ron will have no valid move left. If Ron moves to node 3, Hermione can move it to node 2, and Ron will have no valid move left. In both cases, Ron wins. This test case checks the behavior when the starting node is the middle node.

# Test 14
