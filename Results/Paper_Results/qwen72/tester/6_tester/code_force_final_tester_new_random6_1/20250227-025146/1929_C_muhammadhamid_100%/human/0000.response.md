Sure, here are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem:

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha can win with a strategy where he bets 1 coin after a win and 2 coins after a loss. This ensures he can always recover and continue betting.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 15
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha can place bets in a way that he can recover from up to 3 consecutive losses. This ensures he can always have more coins eventually.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: With a higher k value, Sasha needs to place larger bets to recover, but his initial coins are too few to cover 3 consecutive losses.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha's initial coins are too few to cover 4 consecutive losses, even with a higher k value.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha can place bets in a way that he can recover from up to 4 consecutive losses, given his initial coins and the higher k value.

### Edge Test Cases
