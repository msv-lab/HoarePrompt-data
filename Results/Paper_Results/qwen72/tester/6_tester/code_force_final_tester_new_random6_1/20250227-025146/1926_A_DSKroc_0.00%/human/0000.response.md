B
```
**Scenario**: Strings where the frequency of \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} is equal, but the function should return the first character that appears more frequently in the string. This tests the tie-breaking logic.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
AAAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
A
```

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
BBBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
B
```
**Scenario**: Single test case with a string containing only \texttt{B}. This tests the function's behavior with a string of a single character.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
ABABB
```
**Output**: 
```
B
```
**Scenario**: Single test case with a string where \texttt{B} is the most frequent character. This tests the function's behavior with a minimal number of test cases.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```

**Scenario**: Maximum number of test cases (32) with a mix of strings. This tests the function's scalability and performance.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
AABBA
```
**Output**: 
```
A
```
**Scenario**: String where the frequency of \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} is equal, but \texttt{A} appears first. This tests the tie-breaking logic when the first character is \texttt{A}.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
BAAAB
```
**Output**: 
```
A
```
**Scenario**: String where the frequency of \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} is equal, but \texttt{A} appears first. This tests the tie-breaking logic when the first character is \texttt{A}.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
ABABA
```
**Output**: 
```
A
```
**Scenario**: String where the frequency of \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} is equal, but \texttt{A} appears first. This tests the tie-breaking logic when the first character is \texttt{A}.
