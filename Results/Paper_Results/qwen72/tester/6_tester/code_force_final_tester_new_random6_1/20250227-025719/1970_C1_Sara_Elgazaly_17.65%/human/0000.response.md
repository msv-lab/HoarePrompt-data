Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: A simple tree with 3 nodes and the stone starting at node 3. Ron can move the stone to node 1, and Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with 5 nodes and the stone starting at node 5. Ron can move the stone to node 4, Hermione can move it to node 3, Ron can move it to node 2, and Hermione can move it to node 1, leaving Ron with no valid move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with 4 nodes and the stone starting at node 2. Ron can move the stone to node 1 or node 3. If he moves it to node 1, Hermione can move it to node 2, and Ron has no valid move. If he moves it to node 3, Hermione can move it to node 4, and Ron has no valid move. In both cases, Hermione wins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with 6 nodes and the stone starting at node 4. Ron can move the stone to node 3 or node 5. If he moves it to node 3, Hermione can move it to node 2, Ron can move it to node 1, and Hermione has no valid move. If he moves it to node 5, Hermione can move it to node 6, and Ron has no valid move. In both cases, Ron wins.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The smallest possible tree with 2 nodes and the stone starting at node 2. Ron cannot make a move, so Hermione wins immediately.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: The smallest possible tree with 2 nodes and the stone starting at node 1. Ron cannot make a move, so Hermione wins immediately.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: A very large linear tree with 100,000 nodes and the stone starting at node 1. Ron can only move the stone to node 2, and Hermione can move it to node 3, and so on. Ron will always be the one to make the last move, leaving Hermione with no valid move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: A very large linear tree with 100,000 nodes and the stone starting at node 100,000. Ron can only move the stone to node 99,999, and Hermione can move it to node 99,998, and so on. Ron will always be the one to make the last move, leaving Hermione with no valid move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: A very large linear tree with 200,000 nodes and the stone starting at node 100,000. Ron can move the stone to node 99,999 or node 100,001. In both cases, Hermione will be forced into a position where she eventually loses, so Ron wins.

# Test 10
