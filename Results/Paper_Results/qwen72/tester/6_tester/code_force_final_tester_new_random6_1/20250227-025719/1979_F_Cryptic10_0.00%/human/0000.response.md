### Note
- The actual output for the edge cases will depend on the specific edges removed and the order of vertices in the Hamiltonian path.
- The test cases are designed to cover a wide range of scenarios, including the minimum and maximum number of vertices, different edge removal patterns, and multiple test cases.
- Each test case should be tested individually to ensure the solution works correctly in all scenarios.
