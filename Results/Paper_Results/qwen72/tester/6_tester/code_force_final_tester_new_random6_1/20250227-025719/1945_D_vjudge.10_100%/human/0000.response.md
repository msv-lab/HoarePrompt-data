4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**:
```
14
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is trying to move from position 5 to position 2 in a queue of 4 people. The minimum cost is achieved by moving to position 3 (cost = 6) and then to position 2 (cost = 3 + 8 = 11), totaling 14 coins.

#### Test 2
**Input**:
```
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
22
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is trying to move from position 7 to position 2 in a queue of 6 people. The minimum cost is achieved by moving to position 6 (cost = 3), then to position 5 (cost = 4), and finally to position 2 (cost = 6 + 8 + 1 + 4 = 19), totaling 22 coins.

#### Test 3
**Input**:
```
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**:
```
9
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is trying to move from position 8 to position 7 in a queue of 7 people. The minimum cost is achieved by moving to position 7 (cost = 9), totaling 9 coins.

#### Test 4
**Input**:
```
2 1
2 3
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is trying to move from position 3 to position 1 in a queue of 2 people. The minimum cost is achieved by moving to position 2 (cost = 3) and then to position 1 (cost = 2), totaling 3 coins.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is trying to move from position 2 to position 1 in a queue of 1 person. The only person in the queue has a cost of 1, so Kirill spends 1 coin.

#### Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
200000 1
1 2 3 4 ... 200000
1 2 3 4 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
20000100000
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is trying to move from position 200001 to position 1 in a queue of 200000 people. The cost for each person is the same as their position, so the total cost is the sum of the first 200000 natural numbers, which is 20000100000.

#### Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
10 10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is trying to move from position 11 to position 10 in a queue of 10 people. All costs are 1, so the minimum cost is 1 coin.

#### Test 8

```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is trying to move from position 6 to position 5 in a queue of 5 people. All costs are the maximum possible value, so the minimum cost is 1000000000 coins.

#### Test 9

```
**Output**:
```
5000050000
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is trying to move from position 100001 to position 1 in a queue of 100000 people. The `a_i` values are in increasing order, and the `b_i` values are in decreasing order. The minimum cost is the sum of the first 100000 natural numbers, which is 5000050000.
