It seems there might be a mix-up in the problem description. The problem you've provided is about purchasing concert tickets with specific constraints, but the test case format you've requested is for a function called `has_close_elements`, which is not mentioned in the problem description. I will provide test cases for the concert ticket problem as described.

**Test 2: Simple Case with Larger Numbers**
**Input**:
```
1
5 3 6
10 20 30 40 50
```
**Output**:
```
150
```
**Explanation**: Buy 3 tickets on the first day and 3 tickets on the second day.

**Test 3: Case with Equal Prices**

**Test 9: Maximum Tickets Per Day with Few Days**
**Input**:
```
1
2 1000000000 2000000000
1 2
```

```
2000000000
```
**Explanation**: Buy 1000000000 tickets on the first day and 1000000000 tickets on the second day.

**Test 10: Price Increase Affects Subsequent Days**
**Input**:
```
1
3 2 5
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
11
```
**Explanation**: Buy 2 tickets on the first day, 2 tickets on the second day, and 1 ticket on the third day. The prices after each purchase will be [1, 2, 3] -> [3, 4] -> [5].

**Test 11: Large Number of Test Cases**
**Input**:
```
10000
3 2 3

1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
6
6
...
6
```
**Explanation**: Each test case is the same, and the output for each is 6. (Note: The input is truncated for brevity, but it should contain 10000 identical test cases.)

**Test 12: Edge Case with Very High Prices**
**Input**:
```
1
5 1 5
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
5000000000
```
**Explanation**: Buy 1 ticket each day, resulting in the highest possible total cost.

**Test 13: Edge Case with Very Low Prices**
**Input**:
```
1
5 1 5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Buy 1 ticket each day, resulting in the lowest possible total cost.

**Test 14: Case with k > n*m**
**Input**:
```
1
3 2 7
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
14
```
**Explanation**: Buy 2 tickets on each of the three days, and the remaining 1 ticket on the fourth day, which will have a price of 4 (due to the price increase).

**Test 15: Case with k = n*m**
**Input**:
```
1
3 3 9
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
18
```
**Explanation**: Buy 3 tickets on each of the three days.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios, including small and large inputs, edge cases, and typical use cases, to ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
