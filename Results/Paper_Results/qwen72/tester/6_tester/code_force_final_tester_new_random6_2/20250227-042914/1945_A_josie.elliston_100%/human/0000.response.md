0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
3
3
28
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a variety of basic scenarios with small numbers of participants. It includes cases where there are different combinations of introverts, extroverts, and universals.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
3
2 1 1
3 0 3
0 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
3
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes scenarios where the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals are varied but still manageable. It tests the basic logic of tent allocation.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
4
1 1 1
2 2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4
```
**Output**:
```
-1
3
4
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes scenarios where the number of participants is balanced. It also includes a case where it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there are more extroverts than universals, making it impossible to fulfill the extroverts' requirement.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is only one universal. The universal can live alone, so only one tent is needed.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there are only introverts. Each introvert needs their own tent, so the number of tents required is equal to the number of introverts.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
0 1000000000 0
```
**Output**:
```
333333334
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there are only extroverts. Each tent must contain exactly 3 extroverts, so the number of tents required is the ceiling of the number of extroverts divided by 3.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
333333334
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there are only universals. Universals can be accommodated in any way, so the number of tents required is the ceiling of the number of universals divided by 3.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is one introvert and one extrovert but no universals. It is impossible to accommodate both according to their preferences.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is one introvert and two extroverts but no universals. It is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is one extrovert and one universal. The universal can fill the remaining spot in the tent with the extrovert, so only one tent is needed.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is one introvert and one universal. The introvert needs their own tent, and the universal can live alone, so two tents are needed.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
1 0 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is one introvert and two universals. The introvert needs their own tent, and the two universals can share one tent, so three tents are needed.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
0 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there are two extroverts and one universal. The universal can fill the remaining spot in the tent with the two extroverts, so only one tent is needed.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1666666667
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario with the maximum possible number of participants. It ensures the function can handle large inputs and calculates the minimum number of tents required.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
0 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is one extrovert and two universals. The two universals can fill the remaining spots in the tent with the extrovert, so only one tent is needed.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is one introvert, two extroverts, and one universal. The introvert needs their own tent, and the universal can fill the remaining spot in the tent with the two extroverts, so three tents are needed.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is one introvert, one extrovert, and two universals. The introvert needs their own tent, and the extrovert can share a tent with two universals, so two tents are needed.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
1 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is one introvert, two extroverts, and two universals. The introvert needs their own tent, and the two extroverts can share a tent with one universal, so three tents are needed.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
1
1 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where there is one introvert, two extroverts, and four universals. The introvert needs their own tent, and the two extroverts can share a tent with two universals, so three tents are needed.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including both basic and edge cases, to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
