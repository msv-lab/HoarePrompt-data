0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

**Input**:
```
1
2 1
1000000000 -1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a small array containing very large positive and negative numbers. The optimal strategy is to insert the sum of the positive subarray.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10 100000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
900000000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a large array of all very large positive numbers and a large number of operations. The sum of the array is very large, and inserting it multiple times will need to be handled with modulo.
