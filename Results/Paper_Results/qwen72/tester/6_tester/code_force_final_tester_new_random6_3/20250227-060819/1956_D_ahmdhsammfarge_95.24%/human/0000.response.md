Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**:
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Scenario**: The array has two elements, 0 and 1. The MEX of the entire array is 2, which can be used to replace both elements, resulting in the maximum sum of 4.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**:
```
13 0
```
**Scenario**: The array already has a high sum, and no operations can increase it further. The MEX of any subarray will not be a value that can increase the sum.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Scenario**: The array has a mix of high and low values. By performing operations on the subarrays, we can maximize the sum. First, we replace the third element with its MEX (0), then we replace the third and fourth elements with their MEX (2).

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Scenario**: The array has a single element, 0. The MEX of the array is 1, which can be used to replace the element, resulting in the maximum sum of 1.

**Scenario**: The array contains 18 zeros. The MEX of the entire array is 1, which can be used to replace all elements, resulting in the maximum sum of 18.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
18
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
```
**Output**:
```
324 0
```
**Scenario**: The array contains the first 18 positive integers. The MEX of any subarray will be 0, which does not increase the sum. Therefore, no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
18
18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
324 0
```
**Scenario**: The array contains the first 18 positive integers in reverse order. The MEX of any subarray will be 0, which does not increase the sum. Therefore, no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
18
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
