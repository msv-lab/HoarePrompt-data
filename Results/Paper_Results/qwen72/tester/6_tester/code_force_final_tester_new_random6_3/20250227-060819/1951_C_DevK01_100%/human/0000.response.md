It seems there might be a mix-up in the problem description and the test case format you're requesting. The problem description is about purchasing concert tickets with specific constraints, but the reference to `has_close_elements` function suggests a different problem. Since the task is to create test cases for the concert ticket purchasing problem, I'll focus on that. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: Basic case where the number of tickets to buy is less than the maximum tickets that can be bought in a single day. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket on the third day and 2 tickets on the fourth day.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 5
10 20 30 40 50
```
**Output**: 
```
110
```
**Scenario**: Another basic case where the number of tickets to buy is exactly the maximum tickets that can be bought in a single day. The optimal strategy is to buy 3 tickets on the first day and 2 tickets on the second day.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Scenario**: Basic case where the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is 1. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day for 3 days.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 5 5
10 20
```
**Output**: 
```
50
```
**Scenario**: Basic case where the number of tickets to buy is exactly the maximum tickets that can be bought in a single day, and there are only 2 days. The optimal strategy is to buy all 5 tickets on the first day.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 100 1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where there is only one day to buy tickets. The optimal strategy is to buy the ticket on the first day.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is 1, and the number of tickets to buy is equal to the number of days. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 11
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of tickets to buy is more than the number of days, and the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is 1. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day, and the last ticket will be bought on the last day with an increased price.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 100
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
10000000000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the ticket prices are at the maximum limit (10^9), and the number of tickets to buy is also at the maximum limit (10^9). The optimal strategy is to buy 10 tickets each day for 10 days.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 1000000000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of tickets to buy is at the maximum limit (10^9), but the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is 1. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day, and the last ticket will be bought on the last day with an increased price.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000 1000000000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... (continues to 100000)
```
**Output**: 
```
5000050000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with the maximum number of days (3 * 10^5) and the maximum number of tickets to buy (10^9). The optimal strategy involves buying tickets in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the price increase.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1000000000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where there is only one day to buy tickets, and the number of tickets to buy is at the maximum limit (10^9). The optimal strategy is to buy all tickets on the first day, with the price increasing by 1 for each ticket.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1 1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 ... (continues to 100000)
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of tickets to buy is 1, but the ticket prices are at the maximum limit (10^9) and there are a large number of days. The optimal strategy is to buy the ticket on the first day.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... (continues to 100000)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of tickets to buy is 1, and the ticket prices are at the minimum limit (1) for all days. The optimal strategy is to buy the ticket on the first day.

# Test 14

```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the ticket prices are in increasing order, and the number of tickets to buy is the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets that can be bought per day. The optimal strategy is to buy 10 tickets each day for 10 days.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 100
100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10

```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the ticket prices are in decreasing order, and the number of tickets to buy is the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets that can be bought per day. The optimal strategy is to buy 10 tickets each day for 10 days, but the prices will increase as tickets are bought.

# Test 16
