```
**Scenario**: This test case includes scenarios with small numbers of piles and stones, ensuring that the function can handle simple cases where the smallest pile size is 1 or where all piles have the same number of stones.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
2
4
1 2 3 4
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes scenarios with increasing pile sizes and repeated pile sizes, ensuring that the function can handle cases where the smallest pile size is not the same as the other piles.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there is only one pile with one stone. Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins immediately.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there are 100,000 piles, each with one stone. Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins immediately. This tests the function's performance with a large number of piles.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there are two piles, each with the maximum possible number of stones (1,000,000,000). Alice can win by choosing k=1000000000 on her first turn, which will empty both piles at once.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the piles have consecutive stone counts from 1 to 10. Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, which will leave Bob with a configuration that Alice can always counter.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there is only one pile with the maximum possible number of stones (1,000,000,000). Alice can win by choosing k=1000000000 on her first turn, which will empty the pile at once.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there are two piles, one with one stone and the other with the maximum possible number of stones (1,000,000,000). Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn, leaving Bob with a large pile, and Bob will win on his turn by choosing k=1000000000.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
100000
1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 (100000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there are 100,000 piles, each with the maximum possible number of stones (1,000,000,000). Alice can win by choosing k=1000000000 on her first turn, which will empty all piles at once. This tests the function's performance with a large number of piles and large stone counts.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there are two piles with the smallest possible different stone counts (1 and 2). Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, leaving Bob with a single pile of 1 stone, which Alice can then empty on her next turn.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there are two piles with the smallest possible different stone counts (2 and 1). Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, leaving Bob with a single pile of 1 stone, which Alice can then empty on her next turn.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there are 10 piles, each with one stone. Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins immediately. This tests the function's performance with a moderate number of piles all having the same smallest size.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there are 10 piles with varying stone counts, including the maximum possible number of stones (1,000,000,000). Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, which will leave Bob with a configuration that Alice can always counter.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 2 3 ... 100000 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there are 200,000 piles with consecutive stone counts from 1 to 100,000. Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, which will leave Bob with a configuration that Alice can always counter. This tests the function's performance with the maximum number of piles and a large range of stone counts.

These test cases should provide a thorough evaluation of the function's ability to handle both typical and extreme scenarios, ensuring its robustness, reliability, and scalability.
