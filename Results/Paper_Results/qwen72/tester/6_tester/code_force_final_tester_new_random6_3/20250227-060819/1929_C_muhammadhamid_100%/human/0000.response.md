Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem. These test cases are designed to cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2 1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha can place bets such that he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. He can bet 1 coin after a win or 2 coins after a loss.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2 3 15
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha can place bets such that he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. He can use a strategy where he increases his bet after a loss to ensure he can recover from consecutive losses.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3 3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha cannot guarantee winning any number of coins because his initial amount is too small to recover from 3 consecutive losses.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha cannot guarantee winning any number of coins because his initial amount is too small to recover from 4 consecutive losses.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
5 4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha can place bets such that he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. He can use a strategy where he increases his bet after a loss to ensure he can recover from consecutive losses.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with only 1 coin and can only place a 1-coin bet. If he loses, he cannot place any more bets, so he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with only 1 coin and can only place a 1-coin bet. Even with a high maximum number of consecutive losses, he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins because he will run out of coins after the first loss.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
30 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a large number of coins and can place a 1-coin bet. With a high k value, he can recover quickly from a single loss and is guaranteed to win any number of coins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2 100 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a large number of coins and can place a 1-coin bet. With a high maximum number of consecutive losses, he can still recover and is guaranteed to win any number of coins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
4 88 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a large number of coins but has a very high maximum number of consecutive losses. The k value is not high enough to ensure he can recover from 88 consecutive losses, so he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
25 69 231
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a moderate number of coins and has a high maximum number of consecutive losses. The k value is not high enough to ensure he can recover from 69 consecutive losses, so he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
13 97 18806
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a moderate number of coins and has a very high maximum number of consecutive losses. The k value is not high enough to ensure he can recover from 97 consecutive losses, so he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
2 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a large number of coins and can only lose once in a row. He can place a 1-coin bet and is guaranteed to win any number of coins because he can recover quickly from a single loss.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 2 coins and can only lose once in a row. He can place a 1-coin bet and is guaranteed to win any number of coins because he can recover quickly from a single loss.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 2 coins and can lose twice in a row. If he loses twice, he will run out of coins and cannot place any more bets, so he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 3 coins and can lose twice in a row. He can place a 1-coin bet and is guaranteed to win any number of coins because he can recover from two consecutive losses.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 1 coin and can lose twice in a row. If he loses once, he will run out of coins and cannot place any more bets, so he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
2 100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 100 coins and can lose 100 times in a row. The k value is not high enough to ensure he can recover from 100 consecutive losses, so he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

2 2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a large number of coins and can lose twice in a row. He can place a 1-coin bet and is guaranteed to win any number of coins because he can recover from two consecutive losses.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
2 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 2 coins and can lose three times in a row. If he loses twice, he will run out of coins and cannot place any more bets, so he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 21
**Input**: 
```
2 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 3 coins and can lose three times in a row. He can place a 1-coin bet and is guaranteed to win any number of coins because he can recover from three consecutive losses.

```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 4 coins and can lose three times in a row. He can place a 1-coin bet and is guaranteed to win any number of coins because he can recover from three consecutive losses.
