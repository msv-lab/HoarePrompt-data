```
YES
YES
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes strings of varying lengths and different patterns of matching and non-matching characters. The first and second test cases should return "YES" because valid templates can be found, while the third should return "NO" as no valid templates exist.

1
1
a
b
z
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the scenario where strings a and b are different, and string c is a different character from both a and b. The expected output is "YES" because a valid template can be found.
