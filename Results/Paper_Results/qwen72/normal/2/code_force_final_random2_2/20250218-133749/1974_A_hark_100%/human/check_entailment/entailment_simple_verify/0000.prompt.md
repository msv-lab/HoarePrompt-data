You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` is 0, `k` is `ap` (which is 0). For each iteration, if `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` was updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)` and `y` remained greater than 0. The value of `bxsfory` was `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` was 0 if the new `x` was less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` was `math.ceil(new_x / 15)`. If `x` == 0 and `y` > 0, the value printed was `math.ceil(y / 2)`. If `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, the value printed was `math.ceil(x / 15)`. In all other cases, the value printed was 0. After all iterations, `ap` is 0, and `k` has reached the final value of `ap` (which is 0).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` incorrectly subtracts the number of 1x1 icons that could fit in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. This calculation is flawed because it assumes that each 2x2 icon placement removes 15 possible 1x1 icon placements, which is not accurate. 

A correct approach would be to calculate the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space, considering the grid layout and the constraints of the problem. For example, if `y = 1`, the 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, leaving 11 cells available for 1x1 icons. However, the current implementation incorrectly handles this scenario, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate, consider the test case `(x=1, y=1)`. The program should output `1` because one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon can fit on a single screen. However, the current implementation might produce an incorrect result due to the flawed logic in the calculation.
