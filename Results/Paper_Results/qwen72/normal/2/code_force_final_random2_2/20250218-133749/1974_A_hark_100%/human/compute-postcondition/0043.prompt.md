Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; ap is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(ap):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 0, and `k` is 0. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`, `y` remains greater than 0, `ap` remains greater than 0, `k` remains 0, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`. If `x` == 0 and `y` > 0, then `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. If `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, then `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0. In all other cases, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and it is not the case that (`x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 1, `k` is 1. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` remains unchanged, `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If `x` == 0 and `y` > 0, or if `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` remain undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 2, `k` is 2, and `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are defined based on the conditions given in the problem statement. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, the specific conditions for `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are applied as defined. If `x > 0` and `y == 0`, the specific conditions for `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are applied as defined. Otherwise, the conditions for `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are applied based on the else part of the problem statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
