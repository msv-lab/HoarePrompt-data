The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99
- `ap` must be greater than 0
- `k` is 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` and `y` are now assigned new integer values from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0.**
