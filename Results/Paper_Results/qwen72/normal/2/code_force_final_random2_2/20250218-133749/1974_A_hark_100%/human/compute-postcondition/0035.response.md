Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is an integer read from input, `ap` must be greater than 2, `k` is 2, `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`**.
