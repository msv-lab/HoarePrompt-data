### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`ap`). It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each case.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`) using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - It then adjusts the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) by subtracting the space taken by the 2x2 icons. This is done by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and we need to account for the remaining space on the screens used by 2x2 icons).
     - If there are still 1x1 icons left (`x > 0`), it calculates the additional screens needed for these icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - The total number of screens is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

   - **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The program directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

   - **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0**:
     - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The program prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Mathematical Validity**:
   - The calculation for the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`) is correct because each screen can hold at most 2 of these icons.
   - The calculation for the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15)`) is correct because each screen has 15 cells available for 1x1 icons.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is 0 correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where both `x` and `y` are 0, which is a valid scenario.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the cases correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
