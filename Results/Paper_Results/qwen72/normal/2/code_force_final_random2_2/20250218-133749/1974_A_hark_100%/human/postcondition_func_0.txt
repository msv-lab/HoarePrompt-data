The function `func_1` reads an integer `ap` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input. Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, it calculates and prints a result based on the following rules: 
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a modified value of `x` and prints the sum of two ceiling divisions.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling division of `y` by 2.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling division of `x` by 15.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.
After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the variable `ap` is 0.
