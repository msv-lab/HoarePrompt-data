To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from input.
- `ap` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is 2.
- `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are defined based on the conditions given in the problem statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `y`**: The value of `y` is an integer read from input. The exact value of `y` is not specified in the initial state, but it is an integer.
2. **Expression `y / 2`**: This expression divides `y` by 2. The result of this division is a floating-point number if `y` is odd, and an integer if `y` is even.
3. **Function `math.ceil`**: The `math.ceil` function rounds up the result of `y / 2` to the nearest integer. This means:
   - If `y` is even, `y / 2` is already an integer, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will return that integer.
   - If `y` is odd, `y / 2` will be a floating-point number, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round it up to the next integer.

### Conclusion:
The `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is the integer read from input)**

This means the output will be the ceiling of half of the integer `y` read from input.
