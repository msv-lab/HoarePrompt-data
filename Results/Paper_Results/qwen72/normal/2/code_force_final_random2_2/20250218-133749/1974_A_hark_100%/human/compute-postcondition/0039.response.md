Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from input.
- `ap` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is 2.
- `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are defined based on certain conditions, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the integer `0`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, it will always print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
