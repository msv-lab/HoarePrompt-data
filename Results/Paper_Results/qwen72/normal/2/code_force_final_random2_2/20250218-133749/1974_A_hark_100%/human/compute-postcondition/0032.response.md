Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 2, `k` is 2, `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are defined based on the conditions given in the problem statement.** 

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The values of `t`, `ap`, `k`, `bxsfory`, and `bxsfory1` remain unchanged. The new values of `x` and `y` are now the integers read from the input.
