Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` is updated to \(x - (\lceil y / 2 \rceil \times 15) + (y \times 4)\).
- `y` is greater than 0.
- `ap` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `bxsfory` is the ceiling of \(y / 2\).
- `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of \(x / 15\).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate `bxsfory`:**
   - `bxsfory` is the ceiling of \(y / 2\).
   - Since `y` is greater than 0, `bxsfory` will be a positive integer.

2. **Update `x`:**
   - `x` is updated to \(x - (\lceil y / 2 \rceil \times 15) + (y \times 4)\).
   - Let's denote \(\lceil y / 2 \rceil\) as `ceil_y_half`.
   - Therefore, `x` becomes \(x - (ceil_y_half \times 15) + (y \times 4)\).

3. **Determine `bxsfory1`:**
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of \(x / 15\).
   - We need to check the value of `x` after the update to determine `bxsfory1`.

### Analyzing the Update to `x`:
- Let's denote the original value of `x` as `x0`.
- After the update, `x` becomes \(x0 - (ceil_y_half \times 15) + (y \times 4)\).

To determine if `x` is less than or equal to 0, we need to consider the relationship between `ceil_y_half` and `y`:
- `ceil_y_half` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(y / 2\).
- Therefore, \(ceil_y_half \times 15\) is at least \(7.5y\) (since \(ceil_y_half \geq y / 2\)).

The term \(y \times 4\) is always positive and less than \(7.5y\) for any positive `y`.

Thus, the term \((ceil_y_half \times 15)\) will always be greater than or equal to \(7.5y\), and the term \((y \times 4)\) will always be less than \(7.5y\). This means:
\[ x0 - (ceil_y_half \times 15) + (y \times 4) \leq x0 - 7.5y + 4y = x0 - 3.5y \]

For any positive `y`, \(3.5y\) will be positive, so \(x0 - 3.5y\) will be less than or equal to `x0`. If `x0` is small enough, `x` could become less than or equal to 0.

### Conclusion:
- If `x` is less than or equal to 0 after the update, `bxsfory1` will be 0.
- If `x` is greater than 0 after the update, `bxsfory1` will be the ceiling of \(x / 15\).

However, since we don't have the exact value of `x0`, we can't determine the exact value of `bxsfory1` without more information. But we know that `bxsfory` is a positive integer.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`. Since `bxsfory` is a positive integer and `bxsfory1` is either 0 or a positive integer, the output will be a positive integer.

Output: **bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory is the ceiling of y / 2 and bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the ceiling of x / 15)**
