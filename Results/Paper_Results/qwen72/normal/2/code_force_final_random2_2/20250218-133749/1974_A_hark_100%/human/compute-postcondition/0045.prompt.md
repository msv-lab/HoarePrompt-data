You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` is 0, `k` is `ap` (which is 0). For each iteration, if `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` was updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)` and `y` remained greater than 0. The value of `bxsfory` was `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` was 0 if the new `x` was less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` was `math.ceil(new_x / 15)`. If `x` == 0 and `y` > 0, the value printed was `math.ceil(y / 2)`. If `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, the value printed was `math.ceil(x / 15)`. In all other cases, the value printed was 0. After all iterations, `ap` is 0, and `k` has reached the final value of `ap` (which is 0).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes predefined or externally set values for `t`, `x`, and `y`, where `t` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^4, and `x` and `y` are integers in the range 0 to 99. The specific output or behavior of the function is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
