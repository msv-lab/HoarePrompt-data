Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 2, `k` is 2, `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, `bxsfory1` is defined based on the conditions given in the problem statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bxsfory` is calculated as `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which means it is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `ap`, `k`, and `bxsfory1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
