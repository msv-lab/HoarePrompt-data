Output State: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`, `m` is greater than 1, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s` and then the third character of `s`, `s2` remains an empty string, and `i` is removed from `alphabet` if `len(alphabet) != 1` and `i` is in `alphabet`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s1 += i` appends the third character of `s` (which is `i`) to the string `s1`.
- Since `s1` initially contains the first two characters of `s`, after appending `i`, `s1` now contains the first three characters of `s`.
- The conditions for `s2` and `alphabet` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the given conditions.
- The value of `i` is removed from `alphabet` if `len(alphabet) != 1` and `i` is in `alphabet`.
- All other initial conditions remain valid.
