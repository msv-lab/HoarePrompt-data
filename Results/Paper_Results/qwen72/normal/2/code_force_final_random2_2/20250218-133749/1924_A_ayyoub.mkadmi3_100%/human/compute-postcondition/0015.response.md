Output State: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the second character of `s`, `m` is greater than 1, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, `s2` is a string containing the second character of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k-1 lowercase English alphabets excluding the first character of `s`.** 

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `s2` is initially an empty string if the length of `alphabet` is not 1.
- The code `s2 += i` appends the second character of `s` (which is `i`) to `s2`.
- Therefore, `s2` now contains the second character of `s`.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
