Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the value of `s2`. The boolean is determined by comparing the length of `s1` to `n * k`. The substring is a part of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`. The value of `s2` is either the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, or an empty string otherwise.**
