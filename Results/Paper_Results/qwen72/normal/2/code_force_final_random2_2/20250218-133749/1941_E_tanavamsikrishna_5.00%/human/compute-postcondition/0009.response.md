The provided code appends the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k` of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. Given that `i` is 2, the slice `costs[2:2 + k]` is taken, and its sum is appended to `total_costs`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `total_costs` initially contains two elements: the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements from index `2` to `2 + k` of `costs`.
- After executing the code, `total_costs` will contain three elements: the original two elements plus the new sum of the elements from index `2` to `2 + k` of `costs`.

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged. `total_costs` now contains three elements: the first element is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, the second element is the sum of the elements from index `2` to `2 + k` of `costs`, and the third element is also the sum of the elements from index `2` to `2 + k` of `costs`.**
