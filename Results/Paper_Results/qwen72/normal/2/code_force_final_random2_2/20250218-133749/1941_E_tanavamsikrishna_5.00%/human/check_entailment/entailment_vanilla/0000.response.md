### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the start and end of the row, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports in a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and updates the cost for each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - The final cost is the value in the last cell of the row after processing.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid and calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and selecting the minimum sum.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The input is read correctly and parsed into the required variables.
   - **Row Cost Calculation:** The `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row by considering the constraints on the distance between supports.
   - **Total Cost Calculation:** The `func_2` function correctly calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finding the minimum sum.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when the grid is small.
   - The constraints ensure that the input is valid, and the code handles these constraints appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct minimum total cost for building the bridges.

**Correctness: True**
