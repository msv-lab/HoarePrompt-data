Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments. `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in `costs`. The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.**
