Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments. `total_costs` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments. `total_costs` is now a list containing one element, which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`. `i` is 0, `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments. `total_costs` is now a list containing two elements, where the first element is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the second element is the sum of the elements from index `i` (which is 1) to `i + k` (which is `1 + k`) of `costs`. `i` is 1, `len(costs)` must be greater than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged. `total_costs` now contains three elements: the first element is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, the second element is the sum of the elements from index `2` to `2 + k` of `costs`, and the third element is also the sum of the elements from index `2` to `2 + k` of `costs`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
