The function `func_1` takes a list `row` of non-negative integers and a positive integer `d` as inputs. It modifies the first `d-1` elements of `row` by incrementing each by 1. For the remaining elements starting from index `d-1` to the end of the list, each element is updated to the sum of its current value, 1, and the minimum value from a sublist of `row` that starts from the maximum of 0 or `i - (d + 1)` up to `i`. The function returns the last element of the modified `row` list.
