The code snippet creates a new list called `costs`. Each element in `costs` is the result of calling the function `func_1` with an individual row from the list `rows` and the variable `d` as arguments.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values that will be stored in `costs`. However, we know that `costs` will contain `n` elements, one for each row in `rows`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, and `rows` also remains unchanged as it is only being read from, not modified.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments.**
