No variables are passed into the function `func_2`. However, the function expects input from stdin where the first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, k, and d representing the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. The subsequent n lines contain m space-separated integers representing the depths of the river cells in each row.
