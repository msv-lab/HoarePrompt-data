Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly processes a single row of the river grid.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1, ensuring that the first `d-1` cells have supports.
   - For the remaining elements, it updates each element to the sum of its current value, 1, and the minimum value from a sublist of `row` that starts from the maximum of 0 or `i - (d + 1)` up to `i`. This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The function returns the last element of the modified `row`, which represents the total cost of installing supports in that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the input correctly, parsing the number of rows, columns, bridges, and the maximum distance between supports.
   - It reads the river grid and processes each row using `func_1` to compute the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in the `costs` list.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of these sums, which is the optimal solution for the problem.

Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. The logic and implementation are correct, and the program should produce the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
