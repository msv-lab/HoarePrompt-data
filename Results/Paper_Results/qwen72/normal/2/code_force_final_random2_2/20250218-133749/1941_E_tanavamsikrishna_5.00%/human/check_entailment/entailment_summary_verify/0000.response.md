### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and the original assessment in detail.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row of the river, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
- **Current Implementation**:
  - The function iterates over the row and updates the cost for each cell.
  - For the first `d-1` elements, it simply adds 1 to the depth.
  - For the remaining elements, it uses a sliding window to find the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` elements and adds 1 to the current depth.

#### Issues with `func_1`:
- **Distance Constraint**: The current implementation does not ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. It only considers the minimum cost within a sliding window, which might not respect the distance constraint.
- **Edge Cases**: The function might place supports in suboptimal positions, especially when the depth values are such that the optimal placement requires specific intervals to meet the distance constraint.

#### Example Case:
- Consider the row `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` with `d = 4`.
  - The correct placement of supports should ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than 3 (since `d - 1 = 3`).
  - The current implementation might place supports in a way that violates this constraint, leading to an incorrect cost calculation.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: Read input, compute the cost for each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges.
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Reads the input and constructs the grid.
  - Uses `func_1` to compute the cost for each row.
  - Finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and prints it.

#### Issues with `func_2`:
- **Depends on `func_1`**: Since `func_1` is incorrect, the results computed by `func_2` will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the rules specified in the problem description. This leads to incorrect cost calculations, which in turn affects the overall solution provided by `func_2`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
