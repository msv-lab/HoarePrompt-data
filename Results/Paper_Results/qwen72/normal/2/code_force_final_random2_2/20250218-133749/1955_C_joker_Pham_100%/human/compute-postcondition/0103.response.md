The value of `a[r]` is decreased by the value of `a[l]`. Since `l` is either 0 or 1 and `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, the specific elements being modified depend on these values. However, the exact values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` are not specified, so we can only describe the change in terms of the indices.

- If `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, then `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `a[0]`.
- If `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`, then `a[n - 2]` is decreased by `a[0]`.
- If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`, then `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `a[1]`.
- If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 2`, then `a[n - 2]` is decreased by `a[1]`.

The other conditions remain unchanged:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k - 2 * a[l] ≤ 10^15.
- `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `l` is either 0 or 1.
- `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2.
- `sunks` remains unchanged if `l` equals `r`.

Output State: **`a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k - 2 * a[l] ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` remains unchanged if `l` equals `r`.**
