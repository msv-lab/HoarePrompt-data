You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: The loop will terminate with `l` being greater than `r` or `k` being 0. The variable `sunks` will contain the total count of elements from the list `a` that have been fully processed (either removed or their values reduced to 0) during the loop's execution. The values of `a` will be modified according to the operations performed within the loop, potentially reducing some elements to 0 or altering their values based on the conditions checked. The values of `n` and `k` will remain unchanged from their initial values, except for `k` which may be reduced as per the operations inside the loop.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total count of elements from the list `a` that have been fully processed (either removed or their values reduced to 0) during the loop's execution. This count is stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It processes the list `a` by repeatedly reducing the values of its elements based on the available value of `k`. The function terminates when either the entire list has been processed or `k` is exhausted. The final state of the program is such that the list `a` may have some of its elements reduced to 0 or altered, and the function returns the total count of elements that have been fully processed (reduced to 0 or removed). The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, except for `k` which may be reduced as a result of the operations performed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number of attacks `k` is very large compared to the total durability of all ships. In such a scenario, the program might incorrectly calculate the number of sunk ships due to the way it processes the attacks.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```

Expected Output:
```
5
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
5
```

However, the program's logic is complex and may fail in more subtle edge cases. For instance, consider this input:
```
1
4 10
1 2 3 4
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
4
```

While the program seems to produce the correct output for these examples, the logic used in the program is overly complicated and could lead to incorrect results in more complex scenarios. A simpler and more reliable approach would be to simulate the attacks directly and keep track of the remaining durabilities of the ships until all attacks are performed or all ships are sunk. This would ensure that the program works correctly for all possible inputs.
