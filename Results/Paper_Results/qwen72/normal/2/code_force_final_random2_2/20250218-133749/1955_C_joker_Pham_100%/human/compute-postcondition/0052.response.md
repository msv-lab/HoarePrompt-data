Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, and `a[r] * 2` is not equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
