Output State: **`a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k - 2 * a[l] ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 2 or n - 3, `sunks` is increased by 1, `sunks` remains unchanged if `l` equals `r`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so if `r` was initially `n - 1` or `n - 2`, it is now `n - 2` or `n - 3`, respectively.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
