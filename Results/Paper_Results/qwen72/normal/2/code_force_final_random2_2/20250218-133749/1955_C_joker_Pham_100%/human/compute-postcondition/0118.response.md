Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[r]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is reduced by `2 * a[r]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The specific values of `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` are not altered by this operation.
