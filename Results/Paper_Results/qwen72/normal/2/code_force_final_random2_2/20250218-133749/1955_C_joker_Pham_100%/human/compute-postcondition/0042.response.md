Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is now 1 or 2, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2, the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l-1]`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l-1]` is now 0, and `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now either 1 or 2.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `sunks`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that `a[r]` is less than `a[l-1]` still holds, but now `l-1` is either 0 or 1.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`.
- The value of `a[l-1]` is set to 0.
- The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1.
