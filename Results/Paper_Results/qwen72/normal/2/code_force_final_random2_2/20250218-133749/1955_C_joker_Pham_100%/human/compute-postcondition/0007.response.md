Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `l` is equal to `r`. The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the value of `a[r]`.**
