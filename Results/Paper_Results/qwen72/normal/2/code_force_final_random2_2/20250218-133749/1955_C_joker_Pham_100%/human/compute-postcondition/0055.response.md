Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `a[r] < a[l]`, then: If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, `r` is updated to either n - 2 or n - 3, `sunks` is updated to 1, 2, or 3. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1 or 2, `a[r]` is less than `a[l-1]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l-1]` is set to 0, and `sunks` is updated to 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. If `k` is less than `2 * a[r]`, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `k` is less than `2 * a[r]`. If `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, `sunks` is set to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0, 1, or 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
