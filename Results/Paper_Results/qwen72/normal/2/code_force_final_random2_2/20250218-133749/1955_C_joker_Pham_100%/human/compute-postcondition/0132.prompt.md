Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `a[r] < a[l]`, then: If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, `r` is updated to either n - 2 or n - 3, `sunks` is updated to 1, 2, or 3. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1 or 2, `a[r]` is less than `a[l-1]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l-1]` is set to 0, and `sunks` is updated to 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. If `k` is less than `2 * a[r]`, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `k` is less than `2 * a[r]`. If `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, `sunks` is set to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0, 1, or 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `k` is 0, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `r` is updated to either n - 2 or n - 3 (depending on its initial value), and `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0 and `k` is not 0, otherwise `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is not 0, and `k` and `a[l]` are updated accordingly if `a[l]` is 0. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `a[r] * 2 != k` and `k` is not 0, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement continues.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[r]`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k < a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and all other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged. In all other cases, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, the program continues without changing any variables.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
