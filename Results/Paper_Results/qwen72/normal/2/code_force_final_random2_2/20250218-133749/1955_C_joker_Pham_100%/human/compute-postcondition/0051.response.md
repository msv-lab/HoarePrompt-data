Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` and `r` are indices such that `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2, and `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. Additionally, `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2` is not equal to `k`.***
