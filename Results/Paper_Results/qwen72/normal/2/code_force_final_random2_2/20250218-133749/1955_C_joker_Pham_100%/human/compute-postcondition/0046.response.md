The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly. However, since the `continue` statement is encountered, the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is now either n - 2 or n - 3, `sunks` is now 1, 2, or 3. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is now 1 or 2, the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l-1]`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l-1]` is now 0, and `sunks` is now 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`.**
