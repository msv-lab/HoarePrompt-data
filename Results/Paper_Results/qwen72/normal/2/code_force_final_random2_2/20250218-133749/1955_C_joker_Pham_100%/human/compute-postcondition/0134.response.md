Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`, `k` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. The function returns the total count of elements from the list `a` that have been fully processed (either removed or their values reduced to 0) during the loop's execution.**
