Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\) is true, meaning that \(k - 1\) is less than \(n - k + 1\).

Given the print statement:
```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

Let's break down the values:

1. **Expression `n - k + 1`:**
   - This expression calculates the difference between `n` and `k`, adds 1 to the result.
   - Since \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\), it confirms that \(n - k + 1\) is a positive integer.

2. **Value `1`:**
   - This is a constant integer value.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by the constant integer `1`.

Output: **(n - k + 1, 1) (where n - k + 1 is the result of the expression n - k + 1 and 1 is the constant integer value)**
