### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. Within each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case Check**: The program first checks if `n < k`. If this is true, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins. This is a valid check and the output is correct.

3. **Exact Match Case**: If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" followed by "1" and the value of `n`. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `n` coins each, using all her coins.

4. **General Case**: If `n > k`, the program checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition ensures that Alice can buy `k` jewels by setting up two stalls: one with a price of `n - k + 1` and another with a price of `1`. This is a valid strategy because:
   - Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
   - She will have `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins left, which should be enough to buy the last jewel from the second stall, which costs `1` coin.
   - The remaining coins will be `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) - 1`, which should be non-negative.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their limits (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). It also ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60, which is always satisfied in the given logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The conditions and outputs are consistent with the problem statement and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
