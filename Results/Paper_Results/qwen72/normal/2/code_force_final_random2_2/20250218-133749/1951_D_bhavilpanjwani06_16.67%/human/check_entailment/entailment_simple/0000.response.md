Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using no more than `n` coins. The program uses a series of conditions to decide whether it is possible and, if so, how to set up the stalls.

1. **Initial Check (`n < k`)**:
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for her to buy `k` jewels. Therefore, the program correctly prints "NO".

2. **Exact Match (`n == k`)**:
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `n` coins per jewel. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by `1` (indicating one stall) and `n` (the price per jewel).

3. **General Case (`n > k`)**:
   - The program checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition ensures that Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and then buy 1 more jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
   - If this condition holds, the program correctly prints "YES", followed by `2` (indicating two stalls) and the prices `(n - k + 1, 1)`.
   - If the condition does not hold, the program prints "NO".

Let's analyze the correctness of the logic:

- **Case 1 (`n < k`)**:
  - This is straightforward. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels, she cannot buy `k` jewels. The program correctly handles this case.

- **Case 2 (`n == k`)**:
  - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `n` coins per jewel. The program correctly handles this case.

- **Case 3 (`n > k`)**:
  - The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` ensures that Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and then buy 1 more jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
  - This condition simplifies to `2k - 1 < n`, which means Alice has enough coins to buy `k-1` jewels at a higher price and 1 jewel at a lower price.
  - If this condition holds, the program correctly sets up two stalls with the specified prices.
  - If the condition does not hold, it is impossible to set up the stalls in a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and the program correctly prints "NO".

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all possible cases and outputs the correct results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
