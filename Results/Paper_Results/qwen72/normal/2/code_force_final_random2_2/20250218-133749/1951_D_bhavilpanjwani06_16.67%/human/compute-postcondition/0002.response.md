The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` and `k` are positive integers where both are within the range 1 to 10^18, and it is explicitly stated that the current value of `n` is less than `k`.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
