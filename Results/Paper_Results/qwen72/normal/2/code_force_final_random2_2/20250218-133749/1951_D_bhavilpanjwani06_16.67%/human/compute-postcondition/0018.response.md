The function `func_1` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but based on the problem statement, it should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` represent the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. The function is expected to process each test case and return a result for each.

However, since the function signature provided does not include these parameters, and the output is not specified, I will assume the function is intended to take these parameters and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each.**
