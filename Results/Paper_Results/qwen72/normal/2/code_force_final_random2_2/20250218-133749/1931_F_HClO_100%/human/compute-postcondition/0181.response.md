Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `idx2` is 1, `p2` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution normally.** 

The value of `p2` is set to 1, and the conditions and other variable values remain unchanged.
