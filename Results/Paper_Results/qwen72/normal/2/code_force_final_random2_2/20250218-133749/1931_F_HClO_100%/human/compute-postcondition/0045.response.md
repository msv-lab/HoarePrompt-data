Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, and `m - 2` input operations have occurred. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, the loop breaks out of the current iteration, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, if the element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is `i` (which is 0), `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, and `p2` is 0, and if both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If none of these conditions are met, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 1. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing as usual.***
