To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `i in range(n - 1)`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` is the loop counter and should start at 0.

### Given State:
- `n` is the new input integer greater than 1.
- `i` is `n - 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1, which is already given.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1**
