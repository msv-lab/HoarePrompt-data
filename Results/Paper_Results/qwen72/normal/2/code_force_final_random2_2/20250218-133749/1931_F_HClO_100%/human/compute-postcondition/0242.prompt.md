Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, and `val` is an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `l` is a reference to `l2` which has `a2` inserted at index `n - 3`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `idx2` is `n - 3`, and `l` is a reference to either `l1` (with `a1` inserted at index `n - 3`) or `l2` (with `a2` inserted at index `n - 3`). In the latter case, if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` is decreased by 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing one or two tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from user input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing two or three tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new user input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new user input, `_` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing three or four tuples including the new tuple `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new user input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new user input, `_` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
