Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, the elements at positions `i + p1` in list `l1` and `i + p2` in list `l2` are either not both equal to `a2` and `a1` respectively, or they are not equal to each other. If the element at position `i + p1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is 0 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, the element at position `i + p1` in list `l1` is not equal to `a2`, `idx2` is 0, and `p2` is 1.***
