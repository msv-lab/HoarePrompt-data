The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `m - 3` and `t` is greater than 0 (since the loop has executed at least once). For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `l3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `_` is `m - 2`**
