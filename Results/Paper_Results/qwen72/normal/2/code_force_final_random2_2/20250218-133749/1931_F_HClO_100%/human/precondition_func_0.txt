t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the following k lines contains n distinct integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, who is the author of the screenshot and appears at the top of their own list. All authors of the screenshots are different.
