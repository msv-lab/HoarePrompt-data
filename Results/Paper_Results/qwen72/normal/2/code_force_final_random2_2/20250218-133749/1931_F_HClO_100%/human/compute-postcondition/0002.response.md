The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` are determined by the user's input, while the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers.**
