Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a chat scenario with `n` participants and `k` participants who have posted screenshots. The function reads the input for each test case, which includes the order of participants shown to each screenshot poster. It then determines whether the order of participants can be consistently aligned across all screenshots. If the orders are consistent, the function prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any values but outputs the result for each test case directly to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. **
