Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `val` is an empty list, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a3`, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, and `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l` is a reference to `l1` and `a1` is inserted at `idx2` in `l1`. Otherwise, `l` is a reference to `l2` and `a2` is inserted at `idx1` in `l2`.**
