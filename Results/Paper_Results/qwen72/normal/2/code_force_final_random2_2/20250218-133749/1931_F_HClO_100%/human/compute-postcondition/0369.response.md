Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1 (if `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is now `n - 2`), `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from each new input line and `l3` is the list of integers from the new input line after `a3`, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the last new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the last new input line after `a3`, `_` is `m - 3`, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1` (with `a2` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`), `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2` (with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`), `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**
