Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n - 2`
- `p1` is 1
- `p2` is 1
- `idx1` is `n - 3`
- `idx2` is `n - 3`
- `val` is an empty list
- `idx1` is not less than `idx2`
- `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`
- The value of `m` is 2

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('yes')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
