Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `_` is `m - 1`, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 1` times, `m - 1` input operations have occurred, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from each new input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each new input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, and the program waits for user input which is not stored.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, and the program waits for user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, and the program waits for user input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
