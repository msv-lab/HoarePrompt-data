Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is -1, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, all `m - 2` lines of input have been consumed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 0 or -1, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, all `m - 2` lines of input have been consumed. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, or -1, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then: if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative (i.e., 0 or 1), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither of these conditions is met, the program continues executing the next statement. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, the program continues executing the next statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, or -1, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If neither of these conditions is met, the program continues executing the next statements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
