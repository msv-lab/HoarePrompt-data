The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m` and the current value of `_`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `m - 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `m` must be greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, and `l11` is not equal to `l22`.**
