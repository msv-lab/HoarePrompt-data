Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, and `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `n - 3`.** 

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`, which is `n - 3`. This operation modifies the list `l2` but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `val` remain unchanged.
