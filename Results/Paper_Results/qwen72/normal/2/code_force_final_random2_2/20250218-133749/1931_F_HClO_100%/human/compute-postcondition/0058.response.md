Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `i` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
