Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is equal to 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, which is 0 times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, which is 0 input operations, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, and `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`.**
