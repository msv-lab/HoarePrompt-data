Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `_` is `m - 1`, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 1` times, `m - 1` input operations have occurred, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from each new input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each new input. If `m` is 1, an additional input operation occurs but the input value is not stored, and the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, causing the next iteration to begin. If `m` is not 1, the loop continues as described, breaking and printing 'no' if any `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, or completing and printing 'yes' if all `l3` lists match the condition.**

Explanation:
- The line `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `a1` and `l1` based on the new input.
- `a1` is now the first integer from the new input.
- `l1` is now a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
