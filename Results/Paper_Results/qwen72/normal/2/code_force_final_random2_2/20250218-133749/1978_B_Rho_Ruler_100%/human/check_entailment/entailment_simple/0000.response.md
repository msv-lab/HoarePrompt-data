Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the maximum profit Bob can make by selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at a fixed price `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - This formula correctly computes the total profit by summing the profit from the first `k` buns (using the arithmetic series sum formula) and the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively.
   - It iterates using binary search, calculating the profit for the current midpoint `mid` and the next midpoint `mid + 1`.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum profit found so far.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it moves the search range to the right; otherwise, it moves the search range to the left.
   - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that the optimal `k` is found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `k = 0` (all buns sold at the usual price) and `k = min(n, b)` (all buns sold at the modified price).
   - The constraints `1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9` are respected throughout the program.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the maximum profit for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
