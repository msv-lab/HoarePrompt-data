You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, each within the range 1 to 10^9. It calculates and returns the maximum profit value (`max_profit`) that can be achieved based on these inputs. The function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value, ensuring that the returned `max_profit` is the highest profit encountered during the search process. The original values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The returned `max_profit` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at a fixed price `a`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given `k`.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - `k * b` is the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns if they were all sold at `b`.
     - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts for the fact that the prices decrease linearly.
     - `(n - k) * a` is the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the fixed price `a`.
   - This function correctly computes the profit for a given `k`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.
   - It iterates using a binary search approach:
     - It calculates the profit for the middle value `mid` and the next value `mid + 1`.
     - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means increasing `k` further might yield a higher profit, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum profit found during the search and returns it.

4. **Correctness of the Binary Search**:
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.
   - The condition `if profit_next > profit_mid` correctly determines whether to increase or decrease `k` to find the maximum profit.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is very large or when `b` is very small.
   - The constraints are respected, and the function should work within the given limits.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should solve the problem as described.
