The code snippet assigns the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `mid`, `n`, `a`, and `b` to the variable `profit_mid`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged. The new variable `profit_mid` is introduced with a value that depends on the implementation of `func_1`.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`**.
