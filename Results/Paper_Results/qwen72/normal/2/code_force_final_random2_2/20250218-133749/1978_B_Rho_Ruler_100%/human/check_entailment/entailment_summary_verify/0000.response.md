### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum profit Bob can make by selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The modified price for the i-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The usual price for each bun is `a` coins.
   - The goal is to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the total profit.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
     - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
     - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - This formula correctly computes the profit by summing the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual prices for the remaining `n - k` buns.
   
   - **`func_2(n, a, b)`**:
     - This function uses a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
     - The binary search range is `[0, min(n, b)]`.
     - For each midpoint `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and compares it with the profit for `mid + 1`.
     - The maximum profit found during the search is stored in `max_profit`.
     - The function ensures that all possible values of `k` within the range are considered, and the maximum profit is correctly computed.

3. **Validation of the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit.
   - The use of `func_1` to calculate the profit for a given `k` is correct.
   - The binary search approach in `func_2` ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.
   - The program handles edge cases, such as when `n`, `a`, or `b` are at their minimum or maximum values, and it produces the correct output for all test cases provided in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate.
- The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

Final: **True**
