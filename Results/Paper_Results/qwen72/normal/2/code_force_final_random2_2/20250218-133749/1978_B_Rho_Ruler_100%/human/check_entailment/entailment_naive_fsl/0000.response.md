Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given value of `k`, and `func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit. The binary search ensures that all possible values of `k` within the range `[0, min(n, b)]` are considered, and the maximum profit is correctly computed. The program handles all edge cases, such as when `n`, `a`, or `b` are at their minimum or maximum values, and it produces the correct output for all test cases provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
