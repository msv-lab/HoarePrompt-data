The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. This means `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The condition that `low` is less than or equal to `high` still holds.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
