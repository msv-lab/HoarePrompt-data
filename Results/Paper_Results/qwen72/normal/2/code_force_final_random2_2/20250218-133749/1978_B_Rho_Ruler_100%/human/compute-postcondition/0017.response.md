Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9. `low` is now `mid + 1`. `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`. `mid` is now `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- The value of `high` remains the same, which is the minimum of `n` and `b`.
- The value of `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2` using the new value of `low`.
- The values of `profit_mid` and `profit_next` remain the same, as they are calculated based on the previous value of `mid`.
- The value of `max_profit` remains the same, as it was already updated to the maximum of the original `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
