Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9. `low` is either `mid + 1` if `profit_next > profit_mid`, or remains 0 otherwise. `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`. `mid` is now `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of the original `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `profit_next` to the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged or are determined by their previous values and the new value of `profit_next`.
- The conditions and constraints on `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `max_profit` remain the same as in the initial state.
