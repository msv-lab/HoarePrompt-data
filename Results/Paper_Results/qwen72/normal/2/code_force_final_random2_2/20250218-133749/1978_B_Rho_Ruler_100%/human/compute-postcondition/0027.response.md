Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` is the maximum value between the previous `max_profit` and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
