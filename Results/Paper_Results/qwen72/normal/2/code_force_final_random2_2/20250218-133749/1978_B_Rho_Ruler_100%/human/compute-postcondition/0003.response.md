Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0; `mid` is (0 + min(`n`, `b`)) // 2.**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is set to half of the minimum of `n` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
