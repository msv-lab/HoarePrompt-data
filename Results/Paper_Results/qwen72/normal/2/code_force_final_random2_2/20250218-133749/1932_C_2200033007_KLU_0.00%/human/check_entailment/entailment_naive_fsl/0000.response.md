Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` before removing an element according to the command. Instead, it appends the element to be removed to a list `b` and then computes the product of these elements in reverse order. This approach does not match the problem description, which requires computing the remainder of the product of the current state of the array before each removal.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```
Expected Output:
```
0 2 4 1
```
Actual Output from the Program:
```
0 0 0 0
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
- Initial array: `[3, 1, 4, 2]`
- Command `L`: 
  - Expected: `3 * 1 * 4 * 2 % 6 = 24 % 6 = 0`
  - Actual: The program appends `3` to `b` and later computes the product of `b` in reverse order.
- Command `R`:
  - Expected: `1 * 4 * 2 % 6 = 8 % 6 = 2`
  - Actual: The program appends `2` to `b` and later computes the product of `b` in reverse order.
- Command `R`:
  - Expected: `1 * 4 % 6 = 4 % 6 = 4`
  - Actual: The program appends `4` to `b` and later computes the product of `b` in reverse order.
- Command `L`:
  - Expected: `1 % 6 = 1`
  - Actual: The program appends `1` to `b` and later computes the product of `b` in reverse order.

The program fails to correctly compute the remainder of the product of the current state of the array before each removal, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
