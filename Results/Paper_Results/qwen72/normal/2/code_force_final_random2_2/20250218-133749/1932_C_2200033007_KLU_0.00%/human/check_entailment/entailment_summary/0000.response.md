Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the product and the modulus operation. Specifically, the function `func_1` appends elements to the list `b` based on the commands in `s`, but it does not compute the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` before appending the result to the answer list. Instead, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

The correct approach should involve maintaining the product of the current state of the array `a` and updating this product as elements are removed from `a` based on the commands in `s`. The product should be taken modulo `m` at each step.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = (product * a[l]) % m if s[i] == 'L' else (product * a[r]) % m
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    return b
```

This corrected function maintains the product of the current state of the array `a` and updates it correctly based on the commands in `s`.

Given the provided program's incorrect handling of the product and modulus operations, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
