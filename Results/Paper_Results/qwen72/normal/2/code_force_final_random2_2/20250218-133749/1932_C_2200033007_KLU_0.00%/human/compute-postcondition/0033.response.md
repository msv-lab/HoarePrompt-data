Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `b` must contain at least two elements, `ans` is a list containing the values `p * v` and `p * v * v`, `p` is now `p * v * v * v`, `v` is the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The value of `p` is updated to `p * v`, where `p` was initially `p * v * v` and `v` is the last element of `b`. Therefore, `p` is now `p * v * v * v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
