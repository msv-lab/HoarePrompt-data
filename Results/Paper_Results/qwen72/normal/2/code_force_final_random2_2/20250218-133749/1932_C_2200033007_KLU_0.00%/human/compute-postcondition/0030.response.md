Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `b` must contain at least two elements, `ans` is a list containing the value `p * v`, `p` is now `p * v * v`, `v` is the second-to-last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `p * v`, where `v` is the second-to-last element of `b`.
- All other variables (`i`, `l`, `r`, `b`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `p` is `p * v * v` because `p` was initially `p * v`, and it is now multiplied by `v` again.
