You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, and `b` contains all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`. If `s[i] == 'L'`, the element at index `l - 1` from `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] == 'R'`, the element at index `r` from `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented by 1. The final state of `b` will be a permutation of the elements in `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `b` contains all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, and `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in the original order (not reversed).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. `n` and `m` are positive integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function returns a list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in their original order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in the original order (not reversed).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
