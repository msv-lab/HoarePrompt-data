The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to the list `b`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `a`, `b`, or `r`, we can only infer that the operation modifies `b` by adding one more element from `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r]`.**
