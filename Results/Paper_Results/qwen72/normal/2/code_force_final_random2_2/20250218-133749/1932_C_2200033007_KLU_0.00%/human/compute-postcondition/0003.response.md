To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
- `b` is an empty list.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is n - 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` should be initialized to 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
