#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, and `b` contains all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`. If `s[i] == 'L'`, the element at index `l - 1` from `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] == 'R'`, the element at index `r` from `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented by 1. The final state of `b` will be a permutation of the elements in `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `b` contains all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, and `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in the original order (not reversed).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. `n` and `m` are positive integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function processes the list `a` according to the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`, creating a new list `b` where elements from `a` are appended to `b` from the left or right end based on the characters in `s`. It then computes the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns these cumulative products in the original order of `b`. The final state of the program is that the function returns a list of cumulative products corresponding to the elements in `b`.
