Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 1. After the loop has executed all iterations, the characters in `a` and `b` are such that for any index `i` where 0 ≤ i < len(a), if `a[i]` was initially greater than `b[i]`, they have been swapped, and if `a[i]` was initially less than or equal to `b[i]`, they remain unchanged. The flag `f` is set to 1, indicating that a swap has occurred or that the condition for swapping has been checked and no further swaps are necessary.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters with at least one element, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 1, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters with at least one element, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 1, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 1, `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
