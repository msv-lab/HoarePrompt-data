To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of characters from the input string.
- `b` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character.
- `f` is 1.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `len(a) - 1`.
   - This means `i` is the index of the last character in the list `a`.

2. **Access the element `b[i]`:**
   - The `print` statement is trying to access the element at index `i` in the list `b`.
   - Since `i` is the index of the last character in `a`, it is assumed that `b` has at least as many elements as `a` to avoid an `IndexError`.

3. **Output the element:**
   - The `print` statement will print the character at index `i` in the list `b`.
   - The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline is added after the printed character.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the last character of the list `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the last character of the list `b`**
