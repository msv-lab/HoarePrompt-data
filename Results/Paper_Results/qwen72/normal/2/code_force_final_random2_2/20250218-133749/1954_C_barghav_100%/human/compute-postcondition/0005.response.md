Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `f` is 0. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is less than the current value of `b[i]`.**
