The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

Given the constraints, the function likely processes each test case defined by `t` and performs some operation involving `x` and `y` for each test case. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the problem statement. 

Since the exact return value is not specified, I will assume that the function returns a result for each test case, which could be a list of results or a single aggregated result depending on the context.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers with specific constraints. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
