The code snippet `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. This impacts the value of `loop`, which now holds the input integer.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. The value of `loop` is now set to an integer input, which will typically represent the number of iterations or test cases to be processed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is an input integer.**
