The value of `num` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `no` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element of `no`, and `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`no` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element of `no`, `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, `num` is decreased by 1.**
