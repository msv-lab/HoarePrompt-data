The code snippet `num -= 1` unconditionally decreases the value of `num` by 1. The conditions mentioned in the initial state about `i`, `less`, and `big` do not affect the execution of this code. Therefore, the value of `num` is decreased by 1, while the other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the third element of the non-empty list `no` that must have at least 3 elements. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is decreased by 1.**
