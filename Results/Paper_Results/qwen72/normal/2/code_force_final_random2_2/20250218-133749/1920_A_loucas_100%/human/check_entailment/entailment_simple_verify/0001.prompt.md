You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case.

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `iterable` will be equal to `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is the final calculated value based on the conditions described in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it initializes lists `less`, `big`, and `no` to store the constraints of types 2, 1, and 3, respectively.
   - It also reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`) for the current test case.

2. **Constraint Collection:**
   - For each constraint, it reads the type (`x`) and the value (`a`).
   - Depending on the type, it appends the value to the appropriate list:
     - Type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to `a`) is appended to `big`.
     - Type 2 (k must be less than or equal to `a`) is appended to `less`.
     - Type 3 (k must be not equal to `a`) is appended to `no`.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - It calculates the minimum value from `less` and the maximum value from `big`.
   - The initial number of valid integers `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This represents the range of integers that satisfy both the "greater than or equal to" and "less than or equal to" constraints.

4. **Exclusion of Forbidden Values:**
   - It iterates through the values in `no` (forbidden values) and checks if they fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.
   - If a forbidden value is within this range, it decrements `num` by 1.

5. **Output:**
   - If `num` is less than 1, it prints 0 (indicating no valid integers).
   - Otherwise, it prints the final value of `num`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.
- It ensures that the range is valid by checking if `num` is less than 1 and printing 0 if necessary.
- The logic for excluding forbidden values is also correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
