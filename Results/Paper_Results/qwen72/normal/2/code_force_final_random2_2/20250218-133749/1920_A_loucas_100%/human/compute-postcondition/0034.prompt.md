Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `[a, a]`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a, a]`, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing `[a, a]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` == 1, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `less` is a list, and `no` is a list. If `x` == 2, `less` contains the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are unchanged. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing `a`, and the lists `big` and `less` are determined based on the new value of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
