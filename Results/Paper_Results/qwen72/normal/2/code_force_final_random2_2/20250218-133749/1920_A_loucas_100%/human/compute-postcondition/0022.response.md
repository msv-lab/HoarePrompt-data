The code `no.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since the initial state specifies that `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, appending `a` to `no` means that `no` now contains two instances of `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big` and `less` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing two instances of `a`.**
