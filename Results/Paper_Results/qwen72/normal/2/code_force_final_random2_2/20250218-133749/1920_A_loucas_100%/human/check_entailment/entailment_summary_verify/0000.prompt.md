You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        print(num)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. The function categorizes these constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints where `a` is 1, `less` for constraints where `a` is 2, and `no` for constraints where `a` is 3. It then calculates the number of valid solutions (`num`) that satisfy the conditions: `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, adjusting for any values in `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. The function prints the number of valid solutions for each test case. If no valid solutions exist for a test case, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function ends, leaving the input variables `t` and `n` unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly handle all the constraints described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Constraint Collection**: For each test case, it collects the constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1 (k ≥ x), `less` for constraints of type 2 (k ≤ x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k ≠ x).
3. **Range Calculation**: It calculates the range of valid values for k using `min(less)` and `max(big)`. This ensures that k is within the bounds specified by the constraints of type 1 and 2.
4. **Exclusion of Specific Values**: It checks if any values in the `no` list fall within the calculated range and excludes them from the count.
5. **Output**: It prints the number of valid integers k for each test case.

The program correctly handles edge cases such as:
- When the range is invalid (e.g., `min(less) < max(big)`), it outputs 0.
- When there are no values in the `no` list that fall within the range, it correctly counts all valid integers.
- When there are values in the `no` list that fall within the range, it correctly subtracts these from the count.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
