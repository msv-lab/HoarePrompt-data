Postcondition: ***`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is 2, `x` and `a` are updated to the new integers provided by user input, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2. If the new value of `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `[a, a]`, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a, a]`, `big` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is an empty list. For any other value of `x`, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing `[a]`.***
