### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions. The key points are:
1. Each pair of children has a certain probability of being chosen.
2. If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
3. We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen.

#### Program Analysis:
The program calculates the expected value using the following steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reads the number of children (n), pairs of friends (m), and excursions (k).
3. Sums up the initial friendship values of all pairs.
4. Calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children from n (cn2).
5. Computes the numerator (p) and denominator (q) of the expected value fraction.
6. Simplifies the fraction by dividing both p and q by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
7. Prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The formulas used are:
\[ p = 2 \times k \times \binom{n}{2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \times \binom{n}{2}^2 \]

#### Correctness of the Formulas:
To determine if these formulas are correct, let's break down the expected value calculation:

1. **Probability of Choosing a Friend Pair:**
   - The total number of ways to choose 2 children from n is \(\binom{n}{2}\).
   - The number of friend pairs is m.
   - The probability of choosing a friend pair is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value:**
   - If a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - The expected increase in friendship value per excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

3. **Sum of Expected Values Over k Excursions:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values after k excursions is the sum of the expected increases over k excursions.
   - The expected value for one excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum\_f}\).
   - Over k excursions, the expected value is \(k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum\_f}\).

4. **Adjustment for Subsequent Excursions:**
   - For each friend pair chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The total expected increase in friendship value for a friend pair chosen in the first excursion is \(k - 1\).
   - The expected value for the sum of friendship values over k excursions is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times (k - 1)
     \]

#### Comparison with Program Formulas:
The program's formulas are:
\[ p = 2 \times k \times \binom{n}{2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \times \binom{n}{2}^2 \]

Simplifying the expected value formula:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \times m \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times (k - 1) \times \binom{n}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

This can be rewritten as:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \times m \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times (k - 1) \times \binom{n}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

Comparing this with the program's formula:
\[ p = 2 \times k \times \binom{n}{2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \times \binom{n}{2}^2 \]

We see that the program's formula is not equivalent to the correct expected value formula. The program incorrectly multiplies by 2 and uses \(\binom{n}{2}^2\) in the denominator, which does not match the correct expected value calculation.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program's formulas are incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
