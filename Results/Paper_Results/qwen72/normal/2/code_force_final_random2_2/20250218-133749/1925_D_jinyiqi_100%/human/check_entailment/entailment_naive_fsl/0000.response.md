Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program incorrectly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Specifically, the formula used in the program:

\[ p = 2 \times k \times \binom{n}{2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \times \binom{n}{2}^2 \]

is not correct for the problem's requirements. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair and how the friendship value changes over the excursions.

A correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion and summing these expected values. The current implementation does not correctly account for the changing friendship values over the excursions, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
The expected output should be 4, but the program will produce a different result due to the incorrect formula.
