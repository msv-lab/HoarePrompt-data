Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `k` are input integers, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` must be greater than 0**: This condition remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state and is not modified by the loop.
- **`i` is 0**: This variable is also part of the initial state and is not modified by the loop.
- **`n` and `m` are input integers**: These variables are part of the initial state and are not modified by the loop.
- **`k` are input integers**: This variable is part of the initial state and is not modified by the loop.
- **`sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations**: The loop iterates `m` times, and in each iteration, it reads an integer `f` and adds it to `sum_f`. Therefore, after `m` iterations, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values read.
- **`j` is `m-1`**: The loop variable `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. After `m` iterations, `j` will be `m-1`.
- **`a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration**: In the final iteration of the loop, the values of `a`, `b`, and `f` will be the ones read during that iteration.
