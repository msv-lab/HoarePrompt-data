The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f` respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` must be greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input.**
