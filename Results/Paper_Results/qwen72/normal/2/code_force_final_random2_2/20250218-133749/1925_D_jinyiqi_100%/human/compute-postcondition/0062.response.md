To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is `new_n`.
- `m` is `new_m`.
- `k` is `new_k`.
- `sum_f` is `sum_f + total_f`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration.
- `cn2` is `new_n * (new_n - 1) // 2`.
- `p` is `(2 * new_k * cn2 * (sum_f + total_f) + new_m * new_k * (new_k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` is `(2 * (new_n * (new_n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`.
- `gcd` is `math.gcd(p, q)`.

### Calculation:
1. **Calculate `cn2`**:
   - `cn2 = new_n * (new_n - 1) // 2`

2. **Calculate `p`**:
   - `p = (2 * new_k * cn2 * (sum_f + total_f) + new_m * new_k * (new_k - 1)) // gcd`

3. **Calculate `q`**:
   - `q = (2 * (new_n * (new_n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`

4. **Calculate `gcd`**:
   - `gcd = math.gcd(p, q)`

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The `print` statement calculates `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.

### Explanation:
- `p` and `q` are both divided by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`) to simplify the fraction.
- `pow(q, -1, M)` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`.
- The final result is the product of `p` and the modular inverse of `q`, taken modulo `M`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the calculation `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`, where:
- `p` is the simplified numerator.
- `q` is the simplified denominator.
- `M` is the modulus used in the modular arithmetic.

Output: **int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) (where p and q are the simplified values of the given expressions, and M is the modulus)**
