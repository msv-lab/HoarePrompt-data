The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `s`, `_`, and `s2`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement does not depend on the values of these variables.

Output: **No**
