You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each iteration, `s` was a new input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). The variable `_` ranges from 0 to `t-1`, and for each iteration, `s2` is a shuffled version of the corresponding `s`. For each iteration, if `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition `s != s2` held true, and "Yes" along with the shuffled string `s2` was printed. If `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition `s == s2` held true, and "No" was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of up to 10 lowercase English letters. It then generates a random shuffle `s2` of the string `s`. If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No". The function does not return any value; it only performs these operations and prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. **String Rearrangement**: The function uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of the string `s`. This is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string.
3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If the shuffled string `s2` is different from the original string `s`, the function prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string.
   - If the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, the function prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), the function will always print "No" because any permutation of the string will be the same as the original string.
   - For strings with at least two different characters, the function has a high probability of generating a different permutation, but it is not guaranteed due to the randomness. However, the problem does not require a deterministic solution, so this is acceptable.

5. **Output Format**: The function correctly follows the output format specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
