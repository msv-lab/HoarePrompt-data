The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `s`, `_`, `s2`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
