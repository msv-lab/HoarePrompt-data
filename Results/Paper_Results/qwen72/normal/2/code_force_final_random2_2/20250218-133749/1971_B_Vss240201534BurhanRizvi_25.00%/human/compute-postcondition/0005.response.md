Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters).
- `_` is 0.
- `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`.
- `s` is not equal to `s2`.

Explanation:
- The variable `s2` is a shuffled version of the string `s`, meaning the characters in `s` are rearranged in a different order.
- Since `s2` is guaranteed to be a shuffled version of `s` and not equal to `s`, the output will be a string that contains the same characters as `s` but in a different order.

Output: **a shuffled version of `s` (where `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, and `s2` is not equal to `s`)**
