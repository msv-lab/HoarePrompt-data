Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `_` is 2.
- `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`.
- If `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition `s != s2` holds true.
- If `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition `s == s2` holds true.

Given the initial state, the `print(s2)` statement will print the shuffled version of the string `s`.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `s2`. However, we know that `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`, and it may or may not be different from `s` depending on the shuffle.

Output: **s2 (where s2 is a shuffled version of the string s)**
