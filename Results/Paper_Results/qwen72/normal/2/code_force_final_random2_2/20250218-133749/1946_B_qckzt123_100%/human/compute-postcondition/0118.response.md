The value of `t` is updated to be `t % MOD`. Since `t` was already defined as `(t * 4) % MOD`, applying the modulo operation again does not change its value. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is `(t * 4) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`**
