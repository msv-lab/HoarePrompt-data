Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list `a`.** 

The value of `tmp` is updated to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `tmp` was previously less than 0 is no longer valid.
