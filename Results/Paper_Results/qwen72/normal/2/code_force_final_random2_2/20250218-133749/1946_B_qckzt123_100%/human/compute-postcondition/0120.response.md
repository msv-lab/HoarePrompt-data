The code snippet `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. Given the initial state, `ans` was already calculated as `(ans + t) % MOD`, which means `ans` is already a value modulo `MOD`. Applying `ans %= MOD` again does not change the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is `(t * 4) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`.**
