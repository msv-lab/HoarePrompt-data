Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays of `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `n` and `k` are updated to the new input values, `ans` is now equal to `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is `k-2`, and `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k - 1):
    t *= 2
    t %= MOD
    ans += t
    ans %= MOD


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is `t % MOD`, `ans` is `ans % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The code snippet `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. Since `ans` was already defined as `(ans + t) % MOD` in the initial state, the value of `ans` is effectively unchanged by this operation because it is already the remainder of a division by `MOD`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is `(t * 4) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`.**




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
