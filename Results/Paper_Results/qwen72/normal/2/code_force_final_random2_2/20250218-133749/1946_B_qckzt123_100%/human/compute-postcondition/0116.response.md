The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `k` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the condition `i < k - 1` to hold true.

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`**
