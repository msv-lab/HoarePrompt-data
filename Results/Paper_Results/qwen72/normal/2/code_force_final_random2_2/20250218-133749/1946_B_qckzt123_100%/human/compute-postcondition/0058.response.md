Output State: **`a` must have at least two elements, `tmp` is now `max(0, tmp) + a[1]`, and `t` is now `max(max(0, tmp) + a[1], max(t, max(0, tmp) + a[1]))`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to the maximum of `tmp` and the current value of `t`.
- Since `tmp` is already `max(0, tmp) + a[1]`, the new value of `t` is `max(max(0, tmp) + a[1], max(t, max(0, tmp) + a[1]))`.
- The condition that `a` must have at least two elements remains unchanged.
- The condition that if `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0, also remains unchanged.
