The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `t`. Since `t` is defined as `t % MOD`, the value added to `ans` is the remainder when `t` is divided by `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is `t % MOD`, `ans` is increased by `t % MOD`.**
