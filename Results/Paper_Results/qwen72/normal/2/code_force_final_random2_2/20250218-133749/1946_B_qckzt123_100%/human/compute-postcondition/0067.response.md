Output State: **`t` is now twice the maximum value of the cumulative sums of the subarrays of `a` that do not drop below zero, `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 1, `ans` is now equal to `((s + t * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, `i` is 0.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is multiplied by 2, updating its value to twice its original value. All other variables remain unchanged, and the updated value of `ans` reflects the new value of `t`.
