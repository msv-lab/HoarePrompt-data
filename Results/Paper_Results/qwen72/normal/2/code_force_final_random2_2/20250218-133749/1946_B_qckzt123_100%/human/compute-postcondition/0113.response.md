Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`, `ans` is `ans % MOD`**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. Since `t` was already defined as `(t * 2) % MOD`, applying the modulo operation again does not change its value. The values of `i`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
