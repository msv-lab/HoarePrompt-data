Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is `x`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `n` and `k` are updated to the new input values, `ans` is now equal to `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is `k-2`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, and `tmp` is less than 0.**
