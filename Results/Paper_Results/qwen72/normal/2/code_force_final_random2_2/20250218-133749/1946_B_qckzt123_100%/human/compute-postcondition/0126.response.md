Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of an array `a` of integers and an integer `k`. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the sum of the array elements and the maximum non-negative subarray sum, adjusted by a series of operations involving multiplication and modulo arithmetic. The function prints the final result for each test case to standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
