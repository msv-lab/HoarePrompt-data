Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `n` and `k` are updated to the new input values, `ans` is now equal to `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is `k-2`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The variables `t` and `tmp` are both reset to 0. The values of `s`, `n`, and `k` are updated to the new input values. The value of `ans` is recalculated using the new value of `t` (which is 0), and `i` is set to `k-2`. The list `a` remains a list of integers read from the input.
