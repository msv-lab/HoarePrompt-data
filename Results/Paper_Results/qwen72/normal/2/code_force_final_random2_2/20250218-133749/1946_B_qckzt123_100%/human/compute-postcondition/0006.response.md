Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0.** 

The variables `t` and `tmp` are both initialized to 0, while the other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s`) retain their initial values and conditions.
