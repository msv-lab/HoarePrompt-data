Output State: **`a` must have at least three elements, `tmp` is now 0, and `t` is now `max(max(0, tmp) + a[1], max(t, max(0, tmp) + a[1]))`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `tmp` to 0. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and `t` retains its previous value, which is defined by the expression `max(max(0, tmp) + a[1], max(t, max(0, tmp) + a[1]))`. Since `tmp` is now 0, the expression simplifies to `max(a[1], max(t, a[1]))`, but the exact value of `t` depends on the previous state.
