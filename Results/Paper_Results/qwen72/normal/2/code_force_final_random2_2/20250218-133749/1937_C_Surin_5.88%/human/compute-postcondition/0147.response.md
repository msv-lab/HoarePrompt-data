Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `prev` is now 3, while all other variables retain their original values and conditions.
