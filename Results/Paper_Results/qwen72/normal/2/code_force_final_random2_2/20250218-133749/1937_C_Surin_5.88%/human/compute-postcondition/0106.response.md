To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Analysis:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- The variable `i` will start at 1, as specified by the `range(1, n)`.

### Adjustments:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- `i` should start at 1, which is already the case according to the loop definition.

### Final State:
Given the initial state and the adjustments needed for the loop to execute, the state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called.**
