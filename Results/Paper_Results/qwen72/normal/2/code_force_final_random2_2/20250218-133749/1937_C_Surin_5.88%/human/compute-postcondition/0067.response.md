The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. This operation does not alter the values of any variables or change the program's state in terms of variable values.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.**
