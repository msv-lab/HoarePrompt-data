The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all output is written immediately. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**
