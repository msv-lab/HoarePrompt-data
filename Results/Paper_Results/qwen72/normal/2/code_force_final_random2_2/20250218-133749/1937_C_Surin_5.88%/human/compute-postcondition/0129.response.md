Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input, `prev` is 0. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `prev` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`, `r`) retain their initial values.
- The condition that `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called remains true.
- The condition regarding the value of `r` ('<' or '>') remains unchanged.
