The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `kp` relative to the user input converted to an integer. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is 0, and the user input `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `kp`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.**
