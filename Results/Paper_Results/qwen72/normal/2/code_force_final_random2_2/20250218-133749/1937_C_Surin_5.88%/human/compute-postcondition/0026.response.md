Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, all variables retain their initial values. The output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 3) to `v1`. Therefore, `v1` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
