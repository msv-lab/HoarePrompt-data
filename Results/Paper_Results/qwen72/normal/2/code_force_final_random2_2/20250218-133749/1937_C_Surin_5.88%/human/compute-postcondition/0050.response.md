Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is the user input.
- If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`.
- Otherwise, `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`v1`**: This is set to `n-1`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `v1` will be a non-negative integer.
2. **`prev`**: The value of `prev` depends on the user input `r`.
   - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is set to `n-1`.
   - If `r` is not '>', then `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `r` is '>', then `prev` is `n-1`.
- **Scenario 2**: If `r` is not '>', then `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>'.

### Output:
- In both scenarios, `v1` is always `n-1`.
- The value of `prev` will be either `n-1` (if `r` is '>') or the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>'.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If `r` is '>', the output will be: `! n-1 n-1`.
- If `r` is not '>', the output will be: `! [last index where r was '>' or 0] n-1`.

Since the exact value of `prev` depends on the user input `r`, the most precise description is:

Output: **! [prev] [n-1] (where prev is n-1 if r is '>', or the last index where r was '>' or 0 if r was never '>', and n-1 is the value of v1)**
