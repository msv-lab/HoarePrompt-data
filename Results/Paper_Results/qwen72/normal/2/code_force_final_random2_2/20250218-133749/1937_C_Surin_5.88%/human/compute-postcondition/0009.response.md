The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to flush, which means any buffered data is written to the output immediately. This does not change any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1.**
