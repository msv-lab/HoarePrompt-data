Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to the user input.
- All other variables (`t`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`, `prev`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition for `prev` remains the same, as it depends on the value of `r` and the logic that follows the input.
