Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is the user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.**

Explanation: The value of `v2` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
