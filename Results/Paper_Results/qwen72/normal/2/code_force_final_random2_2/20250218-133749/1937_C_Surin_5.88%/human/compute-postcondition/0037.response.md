The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**
