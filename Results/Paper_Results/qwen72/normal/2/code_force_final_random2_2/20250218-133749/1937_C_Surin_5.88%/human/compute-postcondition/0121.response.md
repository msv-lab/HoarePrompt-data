The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 3, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.**
