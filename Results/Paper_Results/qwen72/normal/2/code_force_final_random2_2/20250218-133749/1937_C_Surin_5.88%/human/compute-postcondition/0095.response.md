The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all output is written immediately. This operation does not change the values of any variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 1 if the previous `r` was '>', or 0 otherwise.**
