The code snippet `r = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `r`. The value of `r` can be any string provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, and `prev` is 1 if the previous `r` was '>', otherwise `prev` is 0.**
