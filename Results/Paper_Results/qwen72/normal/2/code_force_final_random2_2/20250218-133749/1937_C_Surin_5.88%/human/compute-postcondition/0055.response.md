Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, if `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.**

Explanation: The value of `v1` is set to 0, overriding its previous value of `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
