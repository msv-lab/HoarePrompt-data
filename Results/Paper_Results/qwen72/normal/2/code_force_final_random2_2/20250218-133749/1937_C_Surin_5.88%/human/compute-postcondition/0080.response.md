To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- `i` is the loop variable and will start at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `kp` is 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1 (relevant to the loop head)
- `g` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `v1` is `n-1` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is `n-1` (this needs to be adjusted to 1 for the loop to start correctly)
- `v2` is `n-1` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `r` is the user input (not relevant to the loop head)
- `prev` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)

Adjusting the necessary states:
- `i` should be 1 (the starting value for the loop)
- `n` must be greater than 1 (to ensure the loop runs at least once)

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is 0**
