Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is 1, and the user input `r` is equal to '>'**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` is now 1, while the rest of the variables retain their initial values.
