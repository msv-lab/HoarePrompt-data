To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, n)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. For the loop to run at least once, `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - The initial state provided includes `i` being set to `n-1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head. The loop head initializes `i` to 1.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 (unchanged)
- `kp` is 1 (unchanged)
- `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0 (unchanged)
- `v1` is 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 1 (adjusted to match the loop initialization)
- `v2` is `n-1` (unchanged)
- `r` is the user input (unchanged)
- `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop (unchanged)

### Final State:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop**
