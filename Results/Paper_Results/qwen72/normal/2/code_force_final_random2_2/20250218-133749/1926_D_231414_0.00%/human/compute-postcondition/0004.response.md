The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `data`.

- `times` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `data` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
