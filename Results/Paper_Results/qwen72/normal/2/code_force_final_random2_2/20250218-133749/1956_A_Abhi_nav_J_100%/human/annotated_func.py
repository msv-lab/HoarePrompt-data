#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k unique integers in strictly increasing order where 1 <= k <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 100, b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100 and 1 <= b[i] <= 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns an error because the operation `a - 1` is not valid for a list `a`. The subtraction operator cannot be applied directly to a list in Python.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list `b`, which is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100 and 1 <= b[i] <= 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of `k` unique integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= k <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 100), and `b` is a list of `q` integers (1 <= q <= 100 and 1 <= b[i] <= 100). The function attempts to compare `a` and `b`. If the comparison `a <= b` evaluates to `True`, the function will raise an error due to an invalid operation (`a - 1`). If the comparison evaluates to `False`, the function returns the list `b`. In the latter case, the final state of the program is that `b` is returned unchanged.
