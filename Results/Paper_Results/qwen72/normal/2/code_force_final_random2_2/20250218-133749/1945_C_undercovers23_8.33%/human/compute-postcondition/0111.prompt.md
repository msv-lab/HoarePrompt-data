Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 0, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1; if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1. If the percentage of zeros (`zero_perc`) is greater than or equal to 50 and the percentage of ones (`one_perc`) is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is `[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl` (increased by 1 if `s[i]` is '0'), `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 1, `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `lst` is `[1]` if the percentage of zeros (`zero_perc`) is less than 50 or the percentage of ones (`one_perc`) is less than 50. If both percentages are 50 or more, `lst` is `[1, 2]`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1; if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(z * 100 / (i + 1))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl` (increased by 1 if `s[i]` is '0'). If `s[i]` is '0', `z` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1. `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2, `lst` is `[1, 3]` if the percentage of zeros (`zero_perc`) is less than 50 or the percentage of ones (`one_perc`) is less than 50. If both percentages are 50 or more, `lst` is `[1, 2, 3]`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1; if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(z * 100 / 3)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is `[1, 2, 3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
