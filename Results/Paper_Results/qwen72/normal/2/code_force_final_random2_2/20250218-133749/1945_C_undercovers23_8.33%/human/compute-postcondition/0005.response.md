The value of `pk` is assigned the result of `n // 2`, which means `pk` is now equal to half of `n` (since `n` is even, `pk` will be an integer). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is even, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`.**
