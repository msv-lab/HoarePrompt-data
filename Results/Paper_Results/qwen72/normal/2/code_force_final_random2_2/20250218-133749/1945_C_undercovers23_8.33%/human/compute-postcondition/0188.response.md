Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop's execution, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` (the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the integer `0`. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes the integer `n`.**
