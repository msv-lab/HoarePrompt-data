Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The state of other variables (`i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, `mini`, `c1`) remains unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`.
- For each element `elem` in `lst`, it checks if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to the minimum value `mini`.
- If the condition is met, the element `elem` is added to the list `final`.
- After all iterations, `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that satisfy the condition.
- The values of other variables such as `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, `mini`, and `c1` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
