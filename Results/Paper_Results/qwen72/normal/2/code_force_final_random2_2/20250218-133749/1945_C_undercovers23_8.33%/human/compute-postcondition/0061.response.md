Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100,000,000 and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50% during the iterations, and `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `elem` in the list `lst`.
- For each `elem`, it checks if the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and `elem` is equal to `mini`.
- If the condition is met, the element `elem` is appended to the list `final`.
- After all iterations, `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that satisfy the condition.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
