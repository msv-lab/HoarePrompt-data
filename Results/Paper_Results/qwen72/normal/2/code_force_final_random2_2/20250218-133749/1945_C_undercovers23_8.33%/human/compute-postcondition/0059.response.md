Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100,000,000 and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the element `elem` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation:
- The code `final.append(elem)` adds the element `elem` to the list `final`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The condition for adding `elem` to `final` is that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` must be equal to `mini`. If this condition was true, `elem` is added to `final`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.
