Output State: **`one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl` (increased by 1 if `s[i]` is '0'). If `s[i]` is '0', `z` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1. `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2, `lst` is `[1]` if the percentage of zeros (`zero_perc`) is less than 50 or the percentage of ones (`one_perc`) is less than 50. If both percentages are 50 or more, `lst` is `[1, 2]`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1; if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(z * 100 / 3)`**.

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `zero_perc` to `math.ceil(z * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- Given that `i` is 2, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 3.
- Therefore, `zero_perc` is updated to `math.ceil(z * 100 / 3)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
