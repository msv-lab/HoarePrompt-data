Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`final`**: This list is populated with elements from `lst` that satisfy the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. After all iterations, `final` will contain all such elements.
- **`c1`**: This variable is calculated based on the initial conditions and does not change during the loop execution. The length of `final` is determined by the value of `c1`:
  - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` will contain exactly one element.
  - If `c1` is less than 50, `final` will contain `n` and will have a length of 1.
