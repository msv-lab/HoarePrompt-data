The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` contains at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `lst`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least three elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `lst`.

State: **`lst` contains at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` now includes `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.**
