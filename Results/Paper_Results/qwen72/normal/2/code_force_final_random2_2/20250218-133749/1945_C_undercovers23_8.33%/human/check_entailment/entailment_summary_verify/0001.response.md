### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - It initializes variables to keep track of the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`.

2. **Counting Preferences:**
   - The function correctly counts the total number of '0's (`z`) and '1's (`o`) in the string `s`.

3. **Iterating Through Possible Road Positions:**
   - The function iterates through all possible positions to place the road, from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it updates the count of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) on the left side of the road.
   - It calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side.
   - However, the calculation of percentages using `math.ceil` and multiplying by 100 is unnecessary and incorrect. The condition should simply check if the number of '0's on the left is at least half of the left side and the number of '1's on the right is at least half of the right side.

4. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The function finds the position in `lst` that is closest to the middle of the village (`pk`).
   - If there are multiple such positions, it selects the smallest one.
   - If no valid positions are found, it checks the overall satisfaction:
     - If more than half of the residents prefer the right side, it outputs 0.
     - Otherwise, it outputs `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the optimal position for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for counting and checking the satisfaction conditions is mostly correct, but the percentage calculation is flawed.
- The approach to find the optimal position by minimizing the distance to the middle is correct.
- The handling of edge cases (no valid positions) is appropriate.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            pk = n // 2
        else:
            pk = n // 2
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = pow(10, 8)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            left_side = i + 1
            right_side = n - i - 1
            if zero >= (left_side + 1) // 2 and (o - one) >= (right_side + 1) // 2:
                lst.append(i + 1)
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        final.sort()
        if len(final) == 0:
            if o >= (n + 1) // 2:
                final.append(0)
            else:
                final.append(n)
        print(final[0])
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the percentage calculation, which should be corrected. After correcting this, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False** (due to the incorrect percentage calculation, but the logic can be fixed as shown above)
