Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, and for each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` were integers provided by the user input, `friendships` was a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contained integers provided by the user input, and `result` was the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has run `t` times, decrementing `t` each time until it reaches 0. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` were taken from user input, and `friendships` was a list of `m` lists, each containing integers from user input. The function `func_1` was called with these inputs, and the result was printed. The state of any other variables not mentioned in the loop head or body remains unchanged.
