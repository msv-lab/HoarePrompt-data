### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - \( n \): Number of children.
   - \( m \): Number of pairs of friends.
   - \( k \): Number of excursions.
   - \( (a_i, b_i, f_i) \): Pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Output:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Key Points:**
   - Each pair of children can be chosen multiple times.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The friendship value of non-friends remains 0 and does not change.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The function calculates the contribution of each friendship value to the expected sum using the formula \( f \times \left( \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \right) \% \text{MOD} \).
  - This formula is intended to account for the increasing friendship value over \( k \) excursions.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - Reads multiple test cases.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

#### Correctness of the Formula:
- The formula \( f \times \left( \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \right) \% \text{MOD} \) is incorrect because it assumes that the friendship value increases linearly with each excursion, which is not the case.
- The correct approach should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and how their friendship value changes over the excursions.

#### Correct Approach:
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends over \( k \) excursions should be calculated as follows:
  - The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
  - The expected increase in the friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
  - The total expected value for a pair of friends over \( k \) excursions is:
    \[
    \text{Expected Value} = f_i + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}
    \]
  - The total expected value for all pairs of friends is the sum of the expected values for each pair.

#### Example Case:
- Consider the test case:
  - \( n = 3 \)
  - \( m = 1 \)
  - \( k = 2 \)
  - Friendship: \( (1, 2, 1) \)

  - The correct expected value for this case should be:
    \[
    \text{Expected Value} = 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3}
    \]

  - However, the program will output:
    \[
    1 \times (2 \times 3 // 2) = 3
    \]

  - This is clearly incorrect, as the expected value should be \( \frac{5}{3} \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect, and the program will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
