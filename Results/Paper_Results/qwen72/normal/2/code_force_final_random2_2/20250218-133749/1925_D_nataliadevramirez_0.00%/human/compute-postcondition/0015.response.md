To determine what will be printed when the `print(result)` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input.
- `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers provided by the user input.
- `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

### Analysis:
1. **User Input**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user.
   - `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers. This suggests that `friendships` represents a set of relationships or connections between entities, possibly in a social network context.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` is called with the provided inputs.
   - The return value of this function is stored in the variable `result`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will output the value of `result`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`.
- However, based on the context, `result` is the output of the function `func_1`, which processes the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(result)` statement will print the value returned by the function `func_1`. Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`)**
