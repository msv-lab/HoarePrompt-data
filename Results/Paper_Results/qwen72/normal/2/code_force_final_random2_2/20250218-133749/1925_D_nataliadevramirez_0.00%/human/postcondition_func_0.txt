The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. It processes a list of `m` tuples, each representing a friendship with three integers (a, b, f). The function calculates the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each tuple in `friendships` and returns the final sum modulo `MOD`. After the function concludes, the parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `friendships` is not modified. The function's primary purpose is to compute a specific weighted sum based on the input tuples and return the result modulo `MOD`.
