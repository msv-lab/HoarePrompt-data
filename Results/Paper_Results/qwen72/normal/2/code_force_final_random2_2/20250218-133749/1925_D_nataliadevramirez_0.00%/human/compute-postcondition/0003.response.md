The code snippet reads `m` lines from the user input, where each line is split into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. These lists are collected into a list called `friendships`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers provided by the user input.**
