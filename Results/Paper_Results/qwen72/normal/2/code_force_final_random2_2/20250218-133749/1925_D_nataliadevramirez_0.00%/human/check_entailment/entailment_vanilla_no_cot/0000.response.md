Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly multiplies the initial friendship value by the sum of the first k natural numbers for each friendship, which does not account for the probability of selecting each pair and the incremental increase in friendship value over the excursions.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the following:

1. **Probability of Selecting Each Pair**: Since the selection is random and equiprobable, the probability of selecting any specific pair of friends is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of n.

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value**: For each excursion, if a pair of friends is selected, their friendship value increases by 1. The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair over k excursions is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

3. **Total Expected Value**: The total expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen is the sum of the expected values for each pair of friends, considering both the initial friendship value and the expected increase over the excursions.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def modinv(a, m):
    # Function to compute modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem
    return pow(a, m-2, m)

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    result = 0
    for a, b, f in friendships:
        expected_increase = (k * modinv(total_pairs, MOD)) % MOD
        result = (result + f * k + expected_increase * (k * (k + 1) // 2)) % MOD
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# Example usage
func_2()
```

This corrected solution correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
