You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are non-negative integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5. `friendships` is a list of m tuples, each containing three integers (a, b, f) where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b, and 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9. `result` is the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each tuple (a, b, f) in `friendships`. `i` is `m - 1`, `a` is the first element of the tuple at index `m - 1` of `friendships`, `b` is the second element of the tuple at index `m - 1` of `friendships`, and `f` is the third element of the tuple at index `m - 1` of `friendships`.
    return result % MOD
    #The program returns the final value of `result` modulo `MOD`, which is calculated as the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each tuple (a, b, f) in `friendships`, where `f` is the third element of the last tuple in `friendships`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. It processes a list of `m` tuples, each representing a friendship with three integers (a, b, f). The function calculates the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each tuple in `friendships` and returns the final sum modulo `MOD`. After the function concludes, the parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `friendships` is not modified. The function's primary purpose is to compute a specific weighted sum based on the input tuples and return the result modulo `MOD`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.

        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, and for each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` were integers provided by the user input, `friendships` was a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contained integers provided by the user input, and `result` was the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship data. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result of `func_1` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, and the state of the program is such that all input has been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the contribution of each friendship value to the expected sum.

### Issue:
The program uses the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` to calculate the contribution of each friendship value. This formula is incorrect because it assumes that the friendship value increases linearly with each excursion, which is not the case. The correct approach should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and how their friendship value changes over the excursions.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends over the k excursions. For each pair of friends, the expected increase in the friendship value per excursion is the probability of selecting that pair multiplied by the increase in the friendship value. The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), and the expected increase in the friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

The total expected value for a pair of friends over k excursions is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = f_i + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( m = 1 \)
- \( k = 2 \)
- Friendship: \( (1, 2, 1) \)

The correct expected value for this case should be:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \]

However, the program will output:
\[ 1 \times (2 \times 3 // 2) = 3 \]

This is clearly incorrect, as the expected value should be \( \frac{5}{3} \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
