Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers provided by the user input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**. 

The value of `result` is now the output of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
