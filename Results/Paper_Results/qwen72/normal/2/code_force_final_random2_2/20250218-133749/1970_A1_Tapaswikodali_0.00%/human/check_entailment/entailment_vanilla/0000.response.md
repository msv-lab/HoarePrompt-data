### Reasoning:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence up to each character. It increments the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrements it for a closing parenthesis `)`.

2. **Details Collection**: The program collects the balance, negative index, and character in a list called `details`. Using the negative index ensures that when sorting, ties in balance are broken in decreasing order of position, as required.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance and the negative index. This ensures that the characters are ordered according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them together.

5. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string `s` directly from the standard input, which is appropriate for the given problem description.

6. **Output**: The program prints the resulting balanced shuffle sequence, which is the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as specified and follows the steps required to produce the correct result.

### Correctness:
**True**
