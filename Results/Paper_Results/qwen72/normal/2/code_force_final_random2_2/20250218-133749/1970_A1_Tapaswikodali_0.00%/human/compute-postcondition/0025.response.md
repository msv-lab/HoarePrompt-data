Functionality: ** The function reads a non-empty, balanced parentheses sequence from the input, processes it, and prints a transformed version of the sequence. The transformation involves maintaining a balance count of parentheses and recording details about each character. After processing, the function sorts these details and constructs a new string from the sorted data, which is then printed. The final state of the program includes the original string `s` remaining unchanged, and the printed output being a potentially reordered version of the original balanced parentheses sequence. **
