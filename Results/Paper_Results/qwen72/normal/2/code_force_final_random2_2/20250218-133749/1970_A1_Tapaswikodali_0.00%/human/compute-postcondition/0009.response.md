Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `s`, `balance` is 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise `balance` is -1, and `details` is a list containing the tuple (balance, 0, char).** 

The code appends a tuple to the `details` list, which contains the current `balance`, the negation of `i` (which is 0), and the `char`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
