#State of the program right berfore the function call: fillvalue is a string or any other value that can be used as a fill value in a representation function.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the `decorating_function`. Since no information about `decorating_function` was provided in the initial state, it is returned as is, without any modification or additional details.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a `decorating_function` without modifying it. The purpose of the function is to serve as a decorator that makes a `repr` function return the specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls. After the function concludes, the `decorating_function` is returned in its original form, and the `fillvalue` parameter is not directly affected or modified.
