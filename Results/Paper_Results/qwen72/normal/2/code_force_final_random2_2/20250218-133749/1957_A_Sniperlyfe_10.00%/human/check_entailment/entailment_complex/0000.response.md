Reasoning:  
The provided solution aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from a given set of sticks. However, there is a flaw in the logic of the function `func_1`. Specifically, the function divides the frequency of each stick length by 4, which assumes that every polygon must have 4 sides (i.e., it only considers squares). This is incorrect because the problem statement allows for the construction of any regular polygon (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.).

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider the possibility of forming polygons with different numbers of sides. For example, if there are 3 sticks of the same length, they can form a triangle. If there are 5 sticks of the same length, they can form a pentagon. The function should find the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by the smallest possible number of sides (which is 3, for a triangle).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    # Calculate the maximum number of polygons that can be formed
    max_polygons = 0
    for v in freq.values():
        max_polygons += v // 3  # Minimum number of sides for a polygon is 3
    
    return max_polygons
```

Given the current implementation, the function will return incorrect results for test cases where the optimal solution involves forming polygons with fewer than 4 sides.

Correctness: **False**
