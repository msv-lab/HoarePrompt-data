The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. The variable `n` will take the value of the first element in `arr` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `n` is the first element in `arr`**
