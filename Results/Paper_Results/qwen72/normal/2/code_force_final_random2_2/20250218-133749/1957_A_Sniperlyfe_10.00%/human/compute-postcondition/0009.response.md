The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers with the constraint that its length is between 1 and 100, inclusive, and each element in the list is between 1 and 100, inclusive. The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the frequency of an integer in the list `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each integer in `arr` by 4.**
