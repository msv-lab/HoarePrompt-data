Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `n` (the first element in `arr`) and its value is 1, `n` is the first element in `arr`.** 

Explanation: The code updates the `freq` dictionary by incrementing the count of the first element `n` in `arr` by 1. Since `freq` was initially an empty dictionary, the key `n` is added to `freq` with a value of 1. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
