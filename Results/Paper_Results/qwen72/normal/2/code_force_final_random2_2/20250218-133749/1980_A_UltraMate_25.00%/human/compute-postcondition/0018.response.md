Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a string provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `s`, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `p` which is 'ABCDEF'.
- For each character `i` in `p`, the loop checks if `i` is not in the `hmp` (Counter object of `s`).
- If `i` is not in `hmp`, it means `i` is not present in the string `s`, and `ans` is incremented by `m`.
- After all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not found in `s`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, and `p`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
