The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000
- `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50
- `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5
- `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'
- `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user
- `p` is 'ABCDEF'
- `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`
- `i` is the last key in the iteration order of `hmp`
- `ans` is the sum of increments for characters in `hmp` with frequency less than `m`
- The loop has one less iteration remaining

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `m` are reassigned to the new values provided by the user input.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the new integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is the last key in the iteration order of `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of increments for characters in `hmp` with frequency less than `m`, and the loop has one less iteration remaining.**
