Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'C'. If 'C' is not present in the string `s`, then `ans` is `3 * m`. Otherwise, if 'A' is not present in the string `s`, then `ans` is `2 * m`. Otherwise, `ans` is `m`.***
