Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains at least two keys (characters). If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `(m - hmp[i])`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
