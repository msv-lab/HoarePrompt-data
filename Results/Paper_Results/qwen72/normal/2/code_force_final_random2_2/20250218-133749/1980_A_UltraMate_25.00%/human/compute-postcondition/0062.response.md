Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the new integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the new string `s`, `i` is the last key in the iteration order of `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of increments for characters in `hmp` with frequency less than `m`, and the loop has one less iteration remaining.**
