The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the description, it seems to operate with the following inputs:

- `t`: An integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 <= n <= 50, representing the number of problems in the bank.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 <= m <= 5, representing the number of upcoming rounds.
  - `a`: A string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output or return value is not clearly defined in the provided information. Assuming the function is designed to process the test cases and return some form of result (e.g., a list of results, one per test case), the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of problems (`n`), the number of upcoming rounds (`m`), and a string (`a`) representing the difficulties of the problems. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
