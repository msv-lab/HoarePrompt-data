The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. Given the initial state, `n` and `m` are already defined as integers within specific ranges, but their actual values are updated by the user input.

- `n` is now the first integer provided by the user, which must satisfy 1 <= n <= 50.
- `m` is now the second integer provided by the user, which must satisfy 1 <= m <= 5.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged:

- `t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a` is a string of length `n` (now updated) containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `p` is 'ABCDEF'.
- `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
- `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `s`, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `s`, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
