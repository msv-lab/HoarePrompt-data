#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are the last integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the last non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, and `ans` is the final sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character in `s` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n`. It calculates the number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character in 'ABCDEF' appears at least `m` times in the string `s`. The result for each test case is printed. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state includes the last values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `hmp` (a Counter object), along with the calculated `ans` for each test case.
