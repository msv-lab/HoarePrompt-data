Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is reduced by 3 * `ans` (1 ≤ n - 3 * `ans` ≤ 10^6). `s` does not contain the substrings 'map' or 'pie'. `s` is not equal to 'mapie'. `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the string `s` will no longer contain the substring 'pie'. The length of `s` will be reduced by 3 for each occurrence of 'pie' that was found and removed, which is represented by the variable `ans`. The variable `ans` will hold the total count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed from `s`. The conditions that `s` does not contain 'map', is not equal to 'mapie', and consists of lowercase Latin letters remain true throughout the loop's execution.
