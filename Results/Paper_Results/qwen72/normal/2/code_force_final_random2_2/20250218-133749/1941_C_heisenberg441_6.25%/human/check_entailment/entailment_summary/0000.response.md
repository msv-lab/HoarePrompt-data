Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate the substrings "pie" and "map". The function `func_1` correctly identifies and removes these substrings, counting the number of removals needed. However, there is a specific case where the function returns 1 if the string is exactly 'mapie'. This special case is unnecessary because the general logic of the function already handles this case correctly. Removing the special case would simplify the code without affecting its correctness.

Additionally, the function only removes the first two characters of the substrings "map" and "pie" when found, which is correct because removing any two characters from these substrings will prevent them from being substrings anymore. The function continues to search and remove these substrings until none are left, ensuring that the final string is beautiful.

Given the execution summary, the function behaves as expected, and the output matches the expected results for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
