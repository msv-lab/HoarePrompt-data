Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` only removes the first two characters of the substrings "map" and "pie" when found, which may not always result in the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the string "mappppie". The program will remove the first two characters of "map" and "pie" as follows:
- After removing "ma" from "mappppie", the string becomes "pppie".
- After removing "pi" from "pppie", the string becomes "pe".

This results in 4 deletions, but the optimal solution would be to remove only 2 characters to make the string beautiful. For instance, removing the first "m" and the "p" before the "pie" would result in "apppie", which is beautiful.

Thus, the program does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required, making it incorrect.
