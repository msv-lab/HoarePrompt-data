The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: If the substring 'pie' is not found in `s`, the function returns 1.
- **Case_2**: If the substring 'pie' is found in `s`, the function returns the total number of times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return 1 if the substring 'pie' is not found in `s`. If the substring 'pie' is found, it returns the total number of times 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and returns 1 if the substring 'pie' is not found in `s`. If the substring 'pie' is found, it returns the total number of times 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.**
