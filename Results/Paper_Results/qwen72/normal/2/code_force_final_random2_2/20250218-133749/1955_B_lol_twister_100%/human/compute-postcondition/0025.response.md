Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is `n-1`, `li` contains `3n` elements: the first `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are `a + c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the last `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, with `h` starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.
- After the loop completes, `h` will be `n-1`.
- The list `li` initially contains `2n` elements as described in the initial state.
- The loop appends `n` more elements to `li`, each of which is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `li` will contain a total of `3n` elements:
  - The first `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
  - The next `n` elements are `a + c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
  - The last `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
