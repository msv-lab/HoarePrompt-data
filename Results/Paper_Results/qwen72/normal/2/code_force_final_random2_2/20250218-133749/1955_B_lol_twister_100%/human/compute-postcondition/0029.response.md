Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list containing n^2 elements: the elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The lists `l` and `li` are equal.**
