#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n^2` elements: the elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'.
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list containing n^2 elements: the elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. Additionally, `l` is not equal to `li`.
    return 'no'
    #The program returns the string 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. It checks if the list `l` can be transformed into a specific pattern of values derived from the minimum value in `l` and the parameters `c` and `d`. If the sorted version of `l` matches the sorted version of the generated list, it returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'. The function modifies the input list `l` by sorting it, but the original order of `l` is not preserved.
