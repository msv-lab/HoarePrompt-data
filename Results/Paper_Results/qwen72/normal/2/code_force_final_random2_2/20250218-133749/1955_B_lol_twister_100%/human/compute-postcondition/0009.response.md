Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n` elements: `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is 0, `h` is `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 500.
- In each iteration, the loop appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`, where `h` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- After `n` iterations, the list `li` will contain `n` elements, with each element being `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `k` remains 0 throughout the loop, and `h` will be `n-1` after the last iteration.
- The other variables (`n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
