Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer, `t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is equal to `b // 2 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t` is equal to `b // 2 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the second integer read from the input (now converted to an integer), `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.***
