Output State: **`a` is an integer, `t` is equal to `b // 2 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the second integer read from the input (now converted to an integer), `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The new value of `t` is thus `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
