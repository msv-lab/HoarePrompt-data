The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as this is typical for a `range(n)` loop.

State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, x and y are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, n must be greater than 0, i is 0**
