Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input (converted to integers), `t` is the final value computed based on the conditions inside the loop, and `t1` is the last computed value of `t * 15 - b * 4`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop has executed `n` times, the loop variable `i` will have incremented from 0 to `n - 1`.
- **`a` and `b`**: These variables will hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop.
- **`t`**: This variable will hold the final value computed based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `t` is updated based on whether `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, and if not, how many additional units are needed to satisfy the condition.
- **`t1`**: This variable will hold the last computed value of `t * 15 - b * 4` from the final iteration of the loop.
- **`x`, `y`, and `n`**: These variables remain unchanged throughout the loop execution, as they are not modified within the loop body.
