The code snippet `t = t + t2 // 15` updates the value of `t` by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to its current value. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd.
   - `t2` is `a - t1`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
   - `t2 // 15` performs integer division of `t2` by 15.
   - `t` is updated by adding the result of `t2 // 15` to its current value.

3. **Calculation:**
   - `t1` is already defined based on the parity of `b`.
   - `t2` is `a - t1`.
   - `t2 // 15` is the integer part of the division of `t2` by 15.
   - `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15)`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `a` remains an integer.
   - `b` remains an integer.
   - `x` and `y` remain integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
   - `n` remains greater than 2.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `t1` remains `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd.
   - `t2` remains `a - t1`.
   - `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15)`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is `t + (t2 // 15)`.**
