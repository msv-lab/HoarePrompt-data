The code snippet provided is:

```python
b = int(b)
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- The variable `b` is already described as "the second integer read from the input" in the initial state, which implies it is a string representation of an integer.
- The line `b = int(b)` converts `b` from its current string form to an integer.

Since the only change is the conversion of `b` from a string to an integer, and no other variables are affected, the output state remains largely unchanged except for the type of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the second integer read from the input (now converted to an integer), and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t` was even, `t` is now equal to `b // 2`. If `t` was odd, `t` is now even and equal to `(t // 2) + 1`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is set to `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.**
