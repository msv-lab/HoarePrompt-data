Output State: **`t` is now `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`, and `t1` is less than `a`. Additionally, `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2`) retain their previous values and conditions.
- The condition `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0 remains unchanged.
