Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is a string representing the second part of the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged. The new state reflects that `a` is now an integer, while the rest of the conditions from the initial state are still valid.
