Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, x and y are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, representing the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon, respectively. n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b
    if t % 2 == 0:
        t = t // 2
    else:
        t = t // 2 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t` was even, `t` is now equal to `b // 2`. If `t` was odd, `t` is now even and equal to `(t // 2) + 1`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is set to `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer, `t` is initially equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the second integer read from the input (now converted to an integer), and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. If `t1 < a`, then `t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is equal to `b // 2 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t` is equal to `b // 2 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is set to `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15)`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t_initial + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
