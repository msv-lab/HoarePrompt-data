Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is either the first element in the list `l` or the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists) and must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `y + 3` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1, 2, or 3, and `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparison `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` is the first element in the list `l` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, and `b` is the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.***
