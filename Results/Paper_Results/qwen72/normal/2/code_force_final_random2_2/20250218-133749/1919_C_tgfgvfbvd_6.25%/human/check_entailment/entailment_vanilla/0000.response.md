### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty \( p(s) + p(t) \) is minimized.
   - The penalty \( p(b) \) of an array `b` is defined as the number of indices \( i \) between 1 and \( m-1 \) where \( b_i < b_{i+1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `y`.
   - It iterates through the array to find the first increasing pair of elements.
   - It then continues to iterate through the rest of the array, updating `a` and `b` based on certain conditions and incrementing `c` when necessary.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `a` is set to the first element of the array.
     - `b` and `c` are initialized to 0.
     - `y` is used to track the index of the first increasing pair.
   - **Finding the First Increasing Pair:**
     - The loop `for y in range(1, n):` finds the first index `y` where `l[y] > l[y - 1]`.
     - If such a pair is found, `b` is set to `l[y]`.
   - **Processing the Rest of the Array:**
     - The loop `for x in range(y + 1, n):` processes the remaining elements.
     - If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, it updates `a` or `b` based on the difference.
     - If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, it updates `a` or `b` based on the difference.
     - If `l[x]` is only greater than `a`, it updates `b`.
     - If `l[x]` is only less than `a`, it updates `a`.
     - The variable `c` is incremented whenever a new element is added to one of the subsequences.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of the solution seems to be attempting to minimize the penalty by carefully choosing which subsequence to add each element to.
   - However, the conditions for updating `a` and `b` and incrementing `c` are not clearly aligned with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.
   - Specifically, the conditions for updating `a` and `b` and the logic for incrementing `c` do not seem to directly address the minimization of the penalty.

### Conclusion:
The given solution does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the total penalty \( p(s) + p(t) \). The conditions and logic for updating `a`, `b`, and `c` are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
