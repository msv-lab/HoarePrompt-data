Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (if such an element exists; otherwise, `b` remains 0), `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists).
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (if such an element exists; otherwise, `b` remains 0), `c` is 0 or 1, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), `x` is `y + 1`, and `y + 1` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` otherwise. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0, and the following updates occur: if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`; if `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), and `x` is `y + 2` with `y + 2` being less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1 or 2, and either `a` is the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l` and `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (if such an element exists; otherwise, `b` remains 0), or `a` is the first element in the list `l` and `b` is the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `c` is 0, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, and `b` is the value of `l[x]`. If `a >= l[x]` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1 or 2, `a` is the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`, and `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (if such an element exists; otherwise, `b` remains 0). If none of these conditions are met, then `c` is 0, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, and `b` is the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), `x` is `y + 3` with `y + 3` being less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1 or 2 or 3, and if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, `a` is set to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] <= a` or `l[x] <= b`, then either `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` otherwise. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then either `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
