Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, and `x` is `n`. If the second element of `l` (`l[1]`) is greater than the first element of `l` (`l[0]`), `b` is updated to the second element of `l` (`l[1]`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `y`, and `x` remain unchanged.***
