Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), `x` is `y + 1`, and `y + 1` must be less than `n`. Additionally, `l[x]` is less than the original `a` and `l[x]` is less than the original `b`. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists). Otherwise, if `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains the first element in the list `l`.***
