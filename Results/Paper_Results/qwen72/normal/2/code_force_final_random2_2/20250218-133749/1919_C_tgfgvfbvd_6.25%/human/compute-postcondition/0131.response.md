The only objects in the loop head are variables `x`, `y`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` being within the range `(y + 1, n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `y + 2` and is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `y + 3`, and it must still be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), `x` is `y + 3` with `y + 3` being less than `n`**
