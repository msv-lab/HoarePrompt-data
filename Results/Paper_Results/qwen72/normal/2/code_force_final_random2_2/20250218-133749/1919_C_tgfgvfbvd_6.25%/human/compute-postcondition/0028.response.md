Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` must be less than `n - 1`. Additionally, the current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and greater than the previous value of `b`, and the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the previous value of `b`.**
