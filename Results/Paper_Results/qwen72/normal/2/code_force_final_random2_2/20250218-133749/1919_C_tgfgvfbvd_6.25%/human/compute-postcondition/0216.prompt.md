Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists), and `x` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0 or 1, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists) and must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` remains less than `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists) and must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, and `y + 2` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1 or 2, and either `a` or `b` is updated to the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then: if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is updated to the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l` and `b` remains the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists); otherwise, `a` remains the first element in the list `l` and `b` is updated to the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then: if `a` (the first element in the list `l`) is greater than or equal to `l[x]` (the element at index `y + 2`), `a` remains the first element in the list `l` and `b` remains the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists); otherwise, `a` is updated to the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l` and `b` is updated to the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is either the first element in the list `l` or the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists) and must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `y + 3` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1, 2, or 3, and `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparison `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` is the first element in the list `l` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, and `b` is the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
