Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem. 

For example, consider the test case:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
According to the problem, the optimal way to split this array to minimize the penalty is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, which results in a total penalty of 0. However, the provided program would return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is coincidentally correct for this specific case but does not follow the correct logic for splitting the array.

Another example where the program fails is:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The optimal way to split this array to minimize the penalty is `([-1,-1],[1,1,1,1,1,-1])`, which results in a total penalty of `2 * 2 + 2 * 2 = 8`. However, the provided program would return `abs(2 - 8) = 6`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's requirement to split the array optimally to minimize the penalty.
