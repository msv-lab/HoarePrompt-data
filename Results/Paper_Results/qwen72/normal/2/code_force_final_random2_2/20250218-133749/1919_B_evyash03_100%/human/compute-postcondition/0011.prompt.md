Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: expression is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters, length is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and length equals the length of expression, count is 0.
Code of the loop:
for char in expression:
    if char == '+':
        count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 1, `char` is the first character of `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`. If `char` is '+', `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 2, `char` is the second character of `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`. If `char` is '+', `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 3, `char` is the third character of `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`. If `char` is '+', `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
