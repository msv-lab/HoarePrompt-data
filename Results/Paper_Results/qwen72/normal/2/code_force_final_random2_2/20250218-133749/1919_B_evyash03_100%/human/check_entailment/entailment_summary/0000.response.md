Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays, but the given function `func_1` simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the entire string. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty, which involves more complex logic to balance the sums of the subarrays.

For example, in the case of the string `"+-+-+"`, the optimal split would be `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`, not `0` as the function would return. The function fails to account for the possibility of splitting the array into smaller segments to reduce the overall penalty.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
