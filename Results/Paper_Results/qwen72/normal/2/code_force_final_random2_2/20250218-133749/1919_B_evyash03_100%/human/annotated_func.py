#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters, and length is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and length equals the length of expression.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: `expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of `length`, `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters (`sub`) and the number of '+' characters (`count`) in the string `expression`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `expression` and an integer `length` as parameters. It calculates the number of '+' characters in `expression` and the number of '-' characters (which is the total length minus the number of '+' characters). The function returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in `expression`.
