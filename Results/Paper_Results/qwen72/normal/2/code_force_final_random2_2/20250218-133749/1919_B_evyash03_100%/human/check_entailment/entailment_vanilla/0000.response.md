Reasoning:

The problem requires us to minimize the penalty by splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. To achieve the minimum possible penalty, we need to consider how the splits affect the sum of each subarray.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length` as input.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `expression`:
     - If the character is '+', it increments the `count`.
   - It calculates the number of '-' characters as `sub = length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Understanding the Penalty Calculation:**
  - The penalty of a subarray is \( | \text{sum of elements} | \times \text{length of subarray} \).
  - To minimize the penalty, we should aim to create subarrays with sums close to zero, as this will minimize the absolute value of the sum.

- **Optimal Splitting Strategy:**
  - The optimal strategy is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero or as close to zero as possible.
  - This can be achieved by pairing '+' and '-' characters whenever possible.

- **Given Program's Logic:**
  - The program calculates the number of '+' and '-' characters.
  - It returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.
  - This approach works because if the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, the sum of the entire array is zero, and the penalty is zero.
  - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal, the penalty is minimized by the difference in their counts.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters and returning their absolute difference. This approach aligns with the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty.
