Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not implement the required logic to split the array optimally to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not align with the problem's requirements. As demonstrated in the examples, the program fails to produce the correct minimum penalty for several test cases. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
