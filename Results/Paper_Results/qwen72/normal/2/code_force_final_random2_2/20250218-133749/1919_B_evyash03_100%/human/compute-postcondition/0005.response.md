The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`. The loop iterates over each character in `expression`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `expression` needs to be considered.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 1.
- `char` is the first character of `expression`.
- `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`.
- If `char` is '+', `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The next character in `expression` will be the new value of `char`.
- The length of `expression` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Since the loop iterates over the characters of `expression`, the next character in `expression` (after the first one) will be the new `char`. If `expression` has a length of at least 2, the loop will execute again with the second character of `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 2, `char` is the second character of `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`. If `char` is '+', `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
