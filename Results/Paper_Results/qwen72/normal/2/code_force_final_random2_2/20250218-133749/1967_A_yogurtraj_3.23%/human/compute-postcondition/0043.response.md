Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the final value of `r` after the loop completes, `rem` is the final value of `rem` after the loop completes, `y` is the final value of `y` after the loop completes. If `k` is not 0, `r` is set to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If `k` is 0, `r` remains unchanged.***
