Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `y` is 0, and `rem` is 0. If ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is the second integer from user input minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the second element of `a`, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.***
