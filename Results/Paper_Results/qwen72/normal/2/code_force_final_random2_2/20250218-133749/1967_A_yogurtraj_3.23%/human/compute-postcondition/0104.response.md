Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, and `rem` is 0. If `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k`, then `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 1`, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is the second integer from user input minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `y` is 0, and `r` is now `a[1]`.***
