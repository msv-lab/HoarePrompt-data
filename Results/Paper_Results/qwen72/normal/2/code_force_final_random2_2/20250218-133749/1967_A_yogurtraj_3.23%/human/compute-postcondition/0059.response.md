Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from user input minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its original value. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k` is still valid after the update.
