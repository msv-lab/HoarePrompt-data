Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0.** 

The variable `rem` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `rem`.
