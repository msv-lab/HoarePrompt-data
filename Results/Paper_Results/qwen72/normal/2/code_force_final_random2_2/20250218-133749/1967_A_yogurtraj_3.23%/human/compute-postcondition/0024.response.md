The code snippet `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `i` is currently 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `k` starts at 0.

The expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` evaluates to:
- `(1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])` which simplifies to `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.

Since `k` is initially 0, the new value of `k` will be:
- `k = 0 - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])` which simplifies to `k = -2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `rem` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[0]`, `y` is `n - 1`.**
