Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `rem` is 0, `i` is 0. If ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `y` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[1]`, and `y` is 0.***
