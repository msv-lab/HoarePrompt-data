Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[1]`, `y` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `rem` is calculated as `k % (i + 1)`. Given that `k` is 0 and `i` is 1, `rem` becomes `0 % (1 + 1)` which is `0 % 2`, resulting in `rem` being 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `k`, `r`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
