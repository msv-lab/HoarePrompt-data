The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of card types (`n`), the number of coins available (`k`), and a list of initial card counts (`a`). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of new cards that can be bought such that the total number of cards of each type is as equal as possible, given the constraints of the number of coins. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value, but the printed output for each test case represents the solution to the problem.
