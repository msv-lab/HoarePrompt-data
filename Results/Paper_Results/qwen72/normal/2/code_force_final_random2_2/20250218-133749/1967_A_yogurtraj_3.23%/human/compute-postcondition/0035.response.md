Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `r` is `a[3]`, `y` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `rem` is 0, `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1]) - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to `a[3]` because `i` is 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
