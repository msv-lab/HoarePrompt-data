Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is `n - 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`.
- Given that `i` is 1, the expression `n - 1 - i` simplifies to `n - 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
