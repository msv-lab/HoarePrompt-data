The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, or `k`. The list `a` is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**
