The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `c` is described as `c + x`, it implies that `c` has already been updated to `c + x` before this operation.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing the value `c + x`, `c` is now `c + x`.**
