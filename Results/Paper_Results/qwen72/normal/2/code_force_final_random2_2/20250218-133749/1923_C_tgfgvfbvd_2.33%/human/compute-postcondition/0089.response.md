Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.** 

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`.
- The initial state mentions that `l` is a list of integers read from input, which is now explicitly defined by the new input.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `a`, and `b`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their values remain as described in the initial state.
