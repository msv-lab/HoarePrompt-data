You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; l_i and r_i are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.

            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is decremented by the number of test cases processed, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input for the last test case, `l` remains the list of integers read from input for the last test case, `p` remains the list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point for the last test case, `c` remains the sum of all elements in `l` for the last test case, `x` remains the last element in `l` for the last test case, `m` is now 0, and `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` for the last query of the last test case. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` for the last query of the last test case. If the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b - 1` in `l` is greater than 1 and `s` is at least twice the length of this subarray, the condition within the if part is met for the last query of the last test case. Otherwise, the condition within the else part is met for the last query of the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `p`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray.
   - The prefix sum `p[i]` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array `l`.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program extracts the subarray sum using the prefix sums.
   - The subarray sum `s` for the range `[a, b]` is calculated as `p[b-1] - p[a-2]` if `a > 1`, otherwise it is simply `p[b-1]`.

3. **Conditions for a Good Subarray**:
   - The subarray is considered good if:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the subarray length is 1, which is not good by definition.
   - It also ensures that the sum of the subarray is sufficient to form a valid `b` array where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in the subarray.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of prefix sums ensures that each query is processed in constant time, making the solution efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
