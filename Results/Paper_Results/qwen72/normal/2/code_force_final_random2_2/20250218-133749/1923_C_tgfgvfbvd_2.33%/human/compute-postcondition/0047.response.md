Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `m` is 0 (all iterations have been completed).**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `c` to 0, overriding its previous value which was the sum of all elements in `l`. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged. The condition that `m` is 0 (indicating all iterations have been completed) also remains valid.
