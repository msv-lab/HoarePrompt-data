To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^4\).
   - `l` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index minus `p[a - 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index, which is equal to `p[b - 1]`.
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, the condition is not met.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('YES')`.

Given the conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will only execute if the condition is met. Let's analyze the condition step by step:

- **Step 1:** Calculate `s` based on the value of `a`:
  - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s = p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
  - Otherwise, `s = p[b - 1]`.

- **Step 2:** Check the condition:
  - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met.
  - Otherwise, the condition is not met.

Since the print statement `print('YES')` is inside the block of code that checks the condition, it will only print 'YES' if the condition is met. If the condition is not met, nothing will be printed (or the code might print 'NO' if there was a corresponding `else` block, but that is not provided in the snippet).

Therefore, based on the given conditions, the output will be:

Output: **YES (if the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is met)**
