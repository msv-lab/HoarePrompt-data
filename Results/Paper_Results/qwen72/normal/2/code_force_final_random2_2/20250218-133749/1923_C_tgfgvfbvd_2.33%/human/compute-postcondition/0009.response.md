Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the value `c + x`, `c` is now `c + x`, `x` is the second element in the list `l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated to `c + x`, where `x` is the second element in the list `l`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`) remain unchanged.
- The list `p` still contains the value `c + x`, which was the value of `c` before the addition of `x`.
- The initial conditions for `n`, `m`, and `l` remain valid.
