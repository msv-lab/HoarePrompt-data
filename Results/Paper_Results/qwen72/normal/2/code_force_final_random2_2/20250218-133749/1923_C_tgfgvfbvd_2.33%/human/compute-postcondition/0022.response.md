To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^4.
   - `l` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
   - `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index.
   - If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is adjusted to be the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index minus `p[a-2]`.
   - The length of the subarray from index `a` to `b-1` is greater than 1.
   - The cumulative sum `s` is at least twice the length of this subarray.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The length of the subarray from index `a` to `b-1` is greater than 1.
   - The cumulative sum `s` is at least twice the length of this subarray.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute if both conditions are met. Since the conditions are explicitly stated and assumed to be true in the initial state, the `print('YES')` statement will indeed print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
