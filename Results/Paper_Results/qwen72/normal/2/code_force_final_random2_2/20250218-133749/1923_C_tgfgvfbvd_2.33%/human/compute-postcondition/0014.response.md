Output State: **_ is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`.
- For each iteration, the variable `c` is incremented by the current element `x`.
- The updated value of `c` is then appended to the list `p`.
- After the loop completes, `c` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
- The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, meaning the i-th element in `p` is the sum of the first i elements in `l`.
