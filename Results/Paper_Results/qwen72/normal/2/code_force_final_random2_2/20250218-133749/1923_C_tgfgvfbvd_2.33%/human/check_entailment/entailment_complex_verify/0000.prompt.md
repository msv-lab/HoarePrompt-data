You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; l_i and r_i are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.

                s -= p[a - 2]

            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is decremented by the number of test cases processed, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input for the last test case, `l` remains the list of integers read from input for the last test case, `p` remains the list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point for the last test case, `c` remains the sum of all elements in `l` for the last test case, `x` remains the last element in `l` for the last test case, `m` is now 0, and `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` for the last query of the last test case. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` for the last query of the last test case. If the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b - 1` in `l` is greater than 1 and `s` is at least twice the length of this subarray, the condition within the if part is met for the last query of the last test case. Otherwise, the condition within the else part is met for the last query of the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each test case, it reads the list of integers and computes a prefix sum array. For each query, it checks if the sum of a specified subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results of all queries.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the sum of the subarray and checks the conditions for the subarray to be "good." Specifically, the issue lies in the way the prefix sums are used and the condition checking.

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation and Subarray Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum `p` is calculated correctly, but when calculating the sum of the subarray from `a` to `b`, the program uses `p[b - 1]` and subtracts `p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`. This is incorrect because it should subtract `p[a - 1]` instead of `p[a - 2]` to get the correct subarray sum.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):` is used to check if the subarray is "good". However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that there exists a valid array `b` such that all elements are positive, different from `a`, and the sums are equal.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```

- For the query `(1, 5)`, the subarray is `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`.
  - The sum of the subarray is `13`.
  - The program calculates the sum correctly but incorrectly checks the condition.
  - The correct condition should be that the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray plus the number of distinct elements in the subarray.

- For the query `(4, 4)`, the subarray is `[4]`.
  - The sum of the subarray is `4`.
  - The program incorrectly prints `NO` because it does not handle the case where the subarray has only one element.

- For the query `(3, 4)`, the subarray is `[1, 4]`.
  - The sum of the subarray is `5`.
  - The program correctly prints `YES` because the sum is `5` and the length is `2`.

- For the query `(1, 3)`, the subarray is `[1, 2, 1]`.
  - The sum of the subarray is `4`.
  - The program correctly prints `NO` because the sum is `4` and the length is `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the condition for a subarray to be "good" and has issues with the prefix sum calculation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
