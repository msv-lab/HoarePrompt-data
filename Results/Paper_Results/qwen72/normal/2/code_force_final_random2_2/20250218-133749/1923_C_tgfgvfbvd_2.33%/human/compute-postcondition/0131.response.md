The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, and `r_i`. Here, `t` is the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case:

- `n` and `q` are integers representing the size of the list `c` and the number of queries, respectively, with 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers, where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
- Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each query. However, the specific output for each query is not provided in the given information. Based on common patterns in similar functions, the output might involve some computation or analysis on the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, and `r_i`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each query, likely involving some computation on the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]`.**
