To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1.
- The input file has at least five lines.
- `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next line (`line`) using whitespace as the delimiter.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `elements`**:
   - `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line from the input file using whitespace as the delimiter.
   - For example, if the line is `"a b c a b a"`, then `elements` would be `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'a']`.

2. **Set Comprehension `{*elements}`**:
   - `{*elements}` creates a set of unique elements from the list `elements`.
   - Using the example above, `{*elements}` would be `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - `elements.count(item)` counts the number of times each unique item appears in the list `elements`.
   - For the example, `elements.count('a')` would be 3, `elements.count('b')` would be 2, and `elements.count('c')` would be 1.

4. **Integer Division by 3**:
   - `elements.count(item) // 3` performs integer division by 3.
   - For the example, `3 // 3` is 1, `2 // 3` is 0, and `1 // 3` is 0.

5. **Summing the Results**:
   - `sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements})` sums up the results of the integer divisions.
   - For the example, the sum would be `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`.

### Final Output:
The code snippet will print the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique element in the list `elements` by 3.

Output: **sum (where sum is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique element in the list `elements` by 3)**

For the specific example where `elements` is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'a']`, the output would be:
Output: **1**
