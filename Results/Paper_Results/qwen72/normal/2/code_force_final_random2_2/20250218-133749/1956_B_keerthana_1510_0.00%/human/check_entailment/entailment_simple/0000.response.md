Reasoning:  
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by reading every other line starting from the third line, which is supposed to contain the list of integers for each test case. However, the logic used to calculate the maximum number of points you can get is flawed. The expression `sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements})` is incorrect because it counts how many times each unique element appears in the list and divides this count by 3, which is not relevant to the problem statement. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Counting the occurrences of each card in your hand.
2. Determining the strategy to maximize your points while considering Nene's optimal play.

Given the problem's constraints and the need to consider Nene's optimal play, the solution should involve a more sophisticated algorithm that simulates the game or uses a greedy approach to decide the best moves.

Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
