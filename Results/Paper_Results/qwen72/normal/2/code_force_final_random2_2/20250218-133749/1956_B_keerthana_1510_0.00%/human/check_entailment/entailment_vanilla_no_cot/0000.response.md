Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic implemented in the function `func` calculates the sum of the floor division of the count of each unique element by 3. This does not reflect the game's rules or the objective of maximizing the player's score while considering the opponent's optimal play.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- Each player will try to maximize their own score.
- Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize the player's score.
- The player should aim to score points when possible, but also anticipate Nene's moves.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Counting the occurrences of each card in the player's hand.
2. Determining the optimal strategy for placing cards to maximize the player's score, considering Nene's optimal responses.

The provided solution does not implement this logic and instead uses a formula that does not align with the game's rules. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
