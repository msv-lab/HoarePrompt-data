To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1.
- The input file has at least three lines.
- `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the current line (`line`) using whitespace as the delimiter.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `elements`**:
   - `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the current line (`line`) using whitespace as the delimiter. For example, if `line` is `"a b c a a b"`, then `elements` would be `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'b']`.

2. **Set Comprehension `{*elements}`**:
   - `{*elements}` creates a set of unique elements from the list `elements`. For the example `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'b']`, the set would be `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - `elements.count(item)` counts the number of times each unique element appears in the list `elements`. For the example:
     - `elements.count('a')` is 3.
     - `elements.count('b')` is 2.
     - `elements.count('c')` is 1.

4. **Integer Division by 3**:
   - `elements.count(item) // 3` performs integer division by 3. This means it returns the quotient of the division, discarding any remainder.
     - For `a`: `3 // 3` is 1.
     - For `b`: `2 // 3` is 0.
     - For `c`: `1 // 3` is 0.

5. **Summing the Results**:
   - The generator expression `sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements})` sums up the results of the integer divisions.
     - For the example, the sum is `1 + 0 + 0` which is 1.

### Final Output:
The code snippet will print the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique element in `elements` by 3.

Output: **1 (where 1 is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique element in `elements` by 3)**

This output is based on the example provided. If the actual `elements` list contains different elements and their counts, the output will vary accordingly. However, the logic and steps remain the same.
