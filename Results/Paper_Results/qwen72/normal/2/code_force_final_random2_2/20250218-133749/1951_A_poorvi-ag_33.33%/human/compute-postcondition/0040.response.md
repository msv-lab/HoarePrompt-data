The only objects in the loop head are the variable `r` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `r` was the first element of `results`, and `results` is a non-empty list containing `t` elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still have elements left to iterate over. After the last iteration, the first element of `results` has been processed, so `r` should now be the second element of `results`.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` remains the same, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `results` is a non-empty list containing `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop, `r` is the second element of `results`**
