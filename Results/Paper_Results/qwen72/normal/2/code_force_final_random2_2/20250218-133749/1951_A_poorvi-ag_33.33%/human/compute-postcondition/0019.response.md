The code snippet `arr = input()` updates the value of the variable `arr` to the user input. The initial conditions for `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `results` remain unchanged. The new value of `arr` will determine the content of the `results` list based on the conditions provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `results` is determined based on the new value of `arr`.**
