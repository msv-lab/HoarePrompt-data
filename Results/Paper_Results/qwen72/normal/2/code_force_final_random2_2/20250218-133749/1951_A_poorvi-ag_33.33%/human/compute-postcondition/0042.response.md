The only object in the loop head is the variable `r` and the list `results`. The loop iterates over the elements of `results`, so for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `results` to assign to `r`.

At the end of the last iteration, `r` was the second element of `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 3 elements, and `r` will be the third element of `results`.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` remains the same, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `results` is a non-empty list containing `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop, `r` is the third element of `results`**
