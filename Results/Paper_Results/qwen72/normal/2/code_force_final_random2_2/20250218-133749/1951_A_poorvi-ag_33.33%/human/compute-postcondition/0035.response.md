Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. `results` now includes 'no' as its last element.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'no' to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the initial state of `results`, it now ends with the element 'no'. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
