To determine what will be printed by the `print(r)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant details:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`.
   - The current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range.
   - Each of these subfolders may contain .html files.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `i` is `t-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is an input string.
   - `results` is a non-empty list containing `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop.
   - `r` is the third element of `results`.

2. **Determine the Value of `r`**:
   - Since `r` is the third element of `results`, we need to look at the structure of `results`.
   - `results` is a list with `t` elements, and each element is either 'yes' or 'no'.
   - The exact content of `results` is not explicitly provided, but it is stated that each element is determined by conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The value of `r` is the third element of `results`.
   - Since `results` is a list of 'yes' or 'no' values, `r` will be either 'yes' or 'no'.

Therefore, the output of the `print(r)` statement will be one of the following:

Output: **'yes' or 'no' (where 'yes' or 'no' is the third element of the `results` list)**
