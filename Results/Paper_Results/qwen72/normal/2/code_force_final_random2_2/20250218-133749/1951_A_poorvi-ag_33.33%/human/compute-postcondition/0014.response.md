Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. The count of '1's in `arr` is not even. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11' is present in `arr`, then `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. Otherwise, `results` remains an empty list.***
