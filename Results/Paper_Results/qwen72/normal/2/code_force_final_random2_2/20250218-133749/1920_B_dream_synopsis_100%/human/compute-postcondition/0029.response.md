Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0, `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and appended to `ans`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
