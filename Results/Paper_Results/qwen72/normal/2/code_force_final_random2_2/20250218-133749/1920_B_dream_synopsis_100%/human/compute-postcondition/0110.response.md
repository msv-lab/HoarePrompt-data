Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, and `t` iterations remain. If `i == 0`, `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and added to `ans`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and the new value of `sums` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, and the new value of `sums` is added to `ans`.***
