The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, where `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed list `a`, and `a[:x]` is a slice of the first `x` elements of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0
- `x` is an integer
- `a` is a reversed list of integers
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`

After executing the code:
- `ans` now contains the value of `sums` as its first element.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `i` is 0, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
