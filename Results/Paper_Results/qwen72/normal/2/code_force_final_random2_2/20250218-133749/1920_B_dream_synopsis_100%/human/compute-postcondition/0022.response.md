The provided code snippet initializes the variable `sums` to the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
- `a[:x]` represents the first `x` elements of the list `a`.
- `sum(a[:x])` calculates the sum of these first `x` elements.
- `2 * sum(a[:x])` doubles this sum.
- `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` subtracts this doubled sum from `sum1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `x` is an integer.
- `a` is a reversed list of integers.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

After executing the code snippet, the variable `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
