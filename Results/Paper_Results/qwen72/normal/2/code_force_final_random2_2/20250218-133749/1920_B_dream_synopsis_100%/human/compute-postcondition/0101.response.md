Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, and `t` iterations remain. If `i` is 0, `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.***
