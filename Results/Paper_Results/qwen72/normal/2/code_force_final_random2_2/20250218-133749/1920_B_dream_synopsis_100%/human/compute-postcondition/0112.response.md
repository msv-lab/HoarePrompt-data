Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `t` iterations remain, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `a[:x]` is a slice of the list `a` containing the first `x` elements.
- `sum(a[:x])` is the sum of these first `x` elements.
- `2 * sum(a[:x])` is twice the sum of the first `x` elements.
- `sums` is then the difference between `sum1` and `2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
