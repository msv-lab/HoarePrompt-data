The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation modifies the `ans` list by appending one more element to it, which is the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `t - 1` iterations remain, the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
