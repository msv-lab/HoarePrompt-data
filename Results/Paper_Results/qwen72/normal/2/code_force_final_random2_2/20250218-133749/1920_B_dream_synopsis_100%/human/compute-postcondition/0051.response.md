The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, where `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed list `a`, and `a[:x]` represents the first `x` elements of the reversed list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0
- `x` is the third integer read from the input
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`
- `i` is 0
- `ans` is an empty list
- `t - 1` iterations remain
- `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is no longer an empty list; it now contains the value of `sums`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `t - 1` iterations remain, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
