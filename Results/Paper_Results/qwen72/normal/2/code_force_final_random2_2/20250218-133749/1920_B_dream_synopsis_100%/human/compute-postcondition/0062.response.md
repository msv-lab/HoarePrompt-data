The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant expression `k + 1`, so we can only adjust `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `k + 1`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `k + 1` is the upper limit for the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was 0 or not 0 at the end of the last iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, and `t - 1` iterations remain. If `i` is 1, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
