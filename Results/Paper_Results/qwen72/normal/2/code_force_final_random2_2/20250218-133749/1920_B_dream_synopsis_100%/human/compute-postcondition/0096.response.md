The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation does not alter the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, or the condition that `i + x - 1` is less than `n`. However, the list `ans` now contains one more element, which is the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `t` iterations remain, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**
