Output State: **`n` is an integer and must be at least 4, `m` is an integer and must be at least 4, `b` is 4, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + 1 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` was initially `n + 1 + (n + 3) // 9`.
- The code updates `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value.
- Since `b` is 4, `(b * b)` is 16.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, `T`) remain unchanged.
