The only variable in the loop head is `T` and the range defined by `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `T` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `T`.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers derived from the input string such that `min(n, m)` must be at least 2, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`**
