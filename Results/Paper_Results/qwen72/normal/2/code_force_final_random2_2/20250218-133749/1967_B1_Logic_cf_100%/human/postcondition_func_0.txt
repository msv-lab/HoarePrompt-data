The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, where both are positive integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6. It then calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and adds to it the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each integer `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. Finally, it prints the calculated value `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
