Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains a logical error in the calculation of the number of valid pairs. Specifically, the formula used to update `ans` is incorrect. According to the problem statement, we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program incorrectly uses the expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to update `ans`.

The correct approach should involve checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\). The current implementation does not correctly implement this logic.

Additionally, the program does not handle the gcd calculation, which is crucial for determining whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
