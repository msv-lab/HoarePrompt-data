### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Answer**:
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `n`. This is because for every `a` from 1 to `n`, the pair `(a, 1)` always satisfies the condition since \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1)\). This part is correct.

3. **Loop for `b`**:
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This is because `b` must be at least 2 and cannot exceed either `n` or `m`. This part is also correct.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program updates `ans` using the formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.
   - However, this formula is incorrect. The correct condition to check is whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly implement the required condition. It incorrectly assumes that the number of valid pairs for a given `b` can be calculated by dividing `(n + b)` by `(b * b)`, which is not the correct logic.

5. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct way to check the condition is to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and count the pairs that satisfy the condition.
   - The current implementation fails to do this and instead uses an incorrect formula, leading to incorrect results for most test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). It uses an incorrect formula to update the answer, which will lead to incorrect results for most test cases.

Final: **False**
