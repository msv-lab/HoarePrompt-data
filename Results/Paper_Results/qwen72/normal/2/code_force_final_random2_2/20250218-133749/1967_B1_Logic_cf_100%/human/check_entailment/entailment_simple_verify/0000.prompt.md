You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input string such that `min(n, m)` must be at least 2, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is 0, `T` is `t`, `ans` is the sum of `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` by iterating over `b` and adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the answer. This formula does not correctly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The logic used here is flawed and does not match the problem's requirements.

2. **Handling of GCD**: The program does not compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is a crucial part of the problem's condition. Without computing the GCD, it is impossible to check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Range of Iteration**: The program iterates `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`, but this range might not cover all possible values of `b` up to `m`. Additionally, the iteration logic does not correctly handle the constraints and conditions specified in the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` or `m` is 1, the program should return a specific result, but the current logic does not ensure this.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The correct output should be `3` (valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`). However, the program will produce an incorrect result due to its flawed logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
