The function `func` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The output description is missing, so I cannot determine the exact return value based on the given information. If you could provide the expected output or behavior of the function, I would be able to complete the description.

Given the current information:
Functionality: **The function is intended to accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The specific return value or behavior of the function is not provided.**
