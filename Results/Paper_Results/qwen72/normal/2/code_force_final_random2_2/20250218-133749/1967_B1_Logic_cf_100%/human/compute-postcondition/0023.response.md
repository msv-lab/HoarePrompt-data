The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given `n` is 4, `b` is 3, and `ans` is 5:

- Calculate `(n + b)`: 4 + 3 = 7
- Calculate `(b * b)`: 3 * 3 = 9
- Perform integer division: 7 // 9 = 0 (since 7 is less than 9, the result is 0)
- Update `ans`: 5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the value of `ans` remains 5. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `m` is 6, `b` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is 5**
