You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly handle all the constraints specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `ax` to a very large number (greater than the maximum possible value of `x`), and `bx` to a very small number (less than the minimum possible value of `x`). This ensures that `ax` and `bx` will be updated correctly as the constraints are processed.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**: After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints, and it appends `0` to the result list.

4. **Counting Valid `k` Values**: If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the number of invalid `k` values (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement, ensuring that it produces the correct output for every potential input. Therefore, the program is correct.
