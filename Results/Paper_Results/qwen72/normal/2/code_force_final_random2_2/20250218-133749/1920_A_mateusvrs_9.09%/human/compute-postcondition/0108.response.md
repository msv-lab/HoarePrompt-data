The value of `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`. Given that the initial value of `bx` is -1, `bx` will be updated to the value of `x` if `x` is greater than -1. Since `x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than 0 (as `n` is greater than 0 and `x` is an input integer), `bx` will be updated to the value of `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` (since `bx` < `ax`), `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is 0, `bx` is `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `a` is 1, and `x` is an input integer.**
