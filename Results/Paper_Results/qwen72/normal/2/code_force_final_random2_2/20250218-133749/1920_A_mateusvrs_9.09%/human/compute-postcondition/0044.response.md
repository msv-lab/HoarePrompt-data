Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique input integer `x` when `a` is 3, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `tmp` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.***
