Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `ax` is not yet defined, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx` (which was initially undefined, so `bx` is now `x`), `cx` remains an empty set.**
