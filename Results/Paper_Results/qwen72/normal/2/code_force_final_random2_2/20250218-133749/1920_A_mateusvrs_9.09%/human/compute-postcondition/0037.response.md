Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1, `cx` is a set containing all unique input integers `x` when `a` is 3, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is 0.** 

The variable `tmp` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. The initial conditions for `t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` remain unchanged.
