Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first input integer, and `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is set to max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, `ax` is set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is set to max(x, -1), and `cx` remains an empty set. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is set to 1000000007, `bx` is set to max(x, 1000000007), and `cx` is a set containing the input integer `x`.***
