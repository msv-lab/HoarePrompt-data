The code snippet provided reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This impacts the values of `a` and `x` based on the user's input. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `tmp`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`) remain unchanged unless their values depend on the new values of `a` and `x`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `a` and `x` are updated to the values provided by the user.
- `t` remains an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498.
- `r` remains a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`.
- `n` remains greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`.
- `tmp` remains 0.
- `ax` remains 1000000007.
- `bx` and `cx` may change based on the new value of `a`:
  - If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of the original `x` and the original `bx`.
  - If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1.
  - If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is -1 and `cx` contains `{x}`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` and `x` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1 or 2, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of the original `x` and the original `bx`, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `{x}`.**
