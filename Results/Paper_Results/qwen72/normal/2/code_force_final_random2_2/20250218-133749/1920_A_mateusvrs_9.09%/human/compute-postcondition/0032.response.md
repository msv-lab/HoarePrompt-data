Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` == 1, `bx` is set to `x`, `ax` is not yet defined, and `cx` remains an empty set. If `a` == 2, `ax` is set to `x`, `bx` is not yet defined, and `cx` remains an empty set. For any other value of `a`, `ax` is not yet defined, `bx` is not yet defined, and `cx` contains the value `x`.***
