Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `cx` is an empty set, `tmp` is 0, `a` is 1, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `-1`. Since `x` is an input integer, `bx` will be the larger of these two values.
- All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, `cx`, `tmp`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
