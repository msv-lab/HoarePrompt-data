Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1, `cx` is a set containing all unique input integers `x` when `a` is 3, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `cx`.
- For each element `i`, the loop checks if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
- If `i` is within this range, `tmp` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `tmp` will contain the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy the condition `bx <= i <= ax`.
- All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
