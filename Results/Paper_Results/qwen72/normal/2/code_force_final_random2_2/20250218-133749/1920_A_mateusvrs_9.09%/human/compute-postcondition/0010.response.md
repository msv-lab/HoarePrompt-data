The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`. Given that `bx` is initially `-1`, and `x` is an input integer, the new value of `bx` will be the maximum of `x` and `-1`.

Since `x` is an input integer and its value is not specified, we consider two cases:
- If `x` is greater than `-1`, then `bx` will be updated to `x`.
- If `x` is less than or equal to `-1`, then `bx` will remain `-1`.

However, since `x` is an input integer and its value is not specified, we assume the general case where `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `-1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `a` is 1, `x` is an input integer.**
