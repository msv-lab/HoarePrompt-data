The code appends the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. Let's break down the impact:

- `t` remains an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498.
- `r` initially contains `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`.
- `n` remains 0.
- `bx` remains the maximum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 1.
- `ax` remains the minimum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 2 (or 1000000007 if no such input was given).
- `cx` remains a set containing all unique values from the inputs with `a` being 3.
- `tmp` remains the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

After the code execution, the new value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is appended to the list `r`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is now `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, `n` is 0, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 2 (or 1000000007 if no such input was given), `cx` is a set containing all unique values from the inputs with `a` being 3, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.**
