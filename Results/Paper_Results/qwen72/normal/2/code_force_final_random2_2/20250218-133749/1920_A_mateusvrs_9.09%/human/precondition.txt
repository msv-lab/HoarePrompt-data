t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2; no two constraints are the same.
