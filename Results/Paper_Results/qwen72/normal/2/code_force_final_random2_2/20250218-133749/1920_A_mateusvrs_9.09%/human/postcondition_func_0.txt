The function `func` reads a series of test cases, each containing a set of constraints. It processes these constraints to determine the number of valid integers that satisfy the conditions defined by the constraints. Specifically, for each test case, it identifies the maximum lower bound (`bx`) and the minimum upper bound (`ax`) from the constraints of types 1 and 2, respectively. It then counts the number of unique integers from constraints of type 3 that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the function outputs 0 for that test case. Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not excluded by the constraints of type 3 and outputs this count. The function prints the results for all test cases, one per line.
