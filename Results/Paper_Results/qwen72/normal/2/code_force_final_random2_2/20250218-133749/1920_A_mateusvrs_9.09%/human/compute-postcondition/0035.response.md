The code snippet `r.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `r`. This operation changes the state of the variable `r` from being an empty list to a list containing a single element, which is `0`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is a list containing [0], `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1, `cx` is a set containing all unique input integers `x` when `a` is 3, and the current value of `bx` is greater than or equal to the current value of `ax`.**
