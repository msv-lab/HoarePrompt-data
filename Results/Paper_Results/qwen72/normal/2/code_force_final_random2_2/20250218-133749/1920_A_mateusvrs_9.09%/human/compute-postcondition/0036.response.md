Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1, and `cx` is a set containing all unique input integers `x` when `a` is 3. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.**
