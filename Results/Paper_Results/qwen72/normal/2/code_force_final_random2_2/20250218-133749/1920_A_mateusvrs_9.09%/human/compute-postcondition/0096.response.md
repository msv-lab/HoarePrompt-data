Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is 0, and `tmp` is 3 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` is 2. `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing at least two unique values encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3, and `bx` is less than `ax`. `i` is the next value from the set `cx`.***
