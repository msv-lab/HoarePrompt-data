Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes variables to track the minimum upper bound (`ax`), maximum lower bound (`bx`), and a set of excluded values (`cx`).
3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For type 1 constraints (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to the maximum value of `x`.
   - For type 2 constraints (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to the minimum value of `x`.
   - For type 3 constraints (k must be not equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
4. **Checking Feasibility**: After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no valid `k` can satisfy the constraints.
5. **Counting Valid Integers**: If the constraints are feasible, it counts the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) that are not in the set `cx` and appends this count to the result list `r`.
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description, ensuring that it produces the correct output for each test case.
