Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` is 0 or the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, and `a` and `x` are no longer relevant. If `bx` ≥ `ax`, `r` is a list containing two elements `[1000000008, 0]`. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `ax` is updated to 1000000007 (which is the integer part of 1000000000.0 + 7). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
