Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` (assuming `bx` < `ax`), `n` is 0, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 2 (or 1000000007 if no such input was given), `cx` is a set containing all unique values from the inputs with `a` being 3, and `bx` is less than `ax`.**
