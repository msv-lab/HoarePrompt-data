Output State: **The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down). The function should handle up to 100 test cases. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
