The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down). The function should handle up to 100 test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It returns the result based on the initial state of the coins for each test case.**
