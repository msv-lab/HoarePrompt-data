The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines whether the number of "U" characters is greater than the number of "D" characters when `n` is odd, and always returns "no" if `n` is even. The function prints "yes" or "no" for each test case based on these conditions. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case and the program state is reset for the next run.
