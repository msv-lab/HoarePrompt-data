The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1`, and `results` is a list containing at least `t` 'yes' or 'no' entries.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the `results` list must be considered. Since `i` is not used as an index in this loop (the loop iterates directly over the elements of `results`), the value of `i` does not change. Instead, the loop will move to the next element in the `results` list.

Since the loop has already processed `t - 1` elements, there must be at least one more element in the `results` list for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the `results` list must have at least `t` elements, and the loop will process the `t`-th element.

State: **`t` is equal to the number of test cases provided initially, `i` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing at least `t` 'yes' or 'no' entries for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop, and the loop will process the `t`-th element in the next iteration.**
