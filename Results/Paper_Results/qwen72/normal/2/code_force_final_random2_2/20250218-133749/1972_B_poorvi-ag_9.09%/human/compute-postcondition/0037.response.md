Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, `t` remains equal to the number of test cases provided initially, `i` is `t - 1`, and `results` is a list containing exactly `t` 'yes' or 'no' entries for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` still holds the total number of test cases, `i` is still `t - 1` (as it was not modified within the loop), and the `results` list now contains exactly `t` entries, each being either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions checked for each test case. The loop has processed all the elements in the `results` list, and the final state of `results` reflects the outcome of the conditions for all test cases.
