Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes', 'no', or a single 'no'. `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, each including a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` is now an input integer. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `results`, `func`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition about `results` being updated based on the parity of `n` and the content of `arr` is still valid but has not yet been executed.
