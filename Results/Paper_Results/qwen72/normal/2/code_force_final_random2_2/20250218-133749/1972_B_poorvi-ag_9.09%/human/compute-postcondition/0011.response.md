Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing one element 'no', `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, each including a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `n` is odd. The number of 'U' characters in `arr` is less than or equal to the number of 'D' characters in `arr`.**
