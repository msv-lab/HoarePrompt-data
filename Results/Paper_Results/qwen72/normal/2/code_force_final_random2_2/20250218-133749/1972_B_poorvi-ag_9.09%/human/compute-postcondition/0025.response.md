The code appends the string 'no' to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `results` is a list that already contains either 'yes', 'no', or a single 'no'. After appending 'no', the list `results` will contain one more 'no' than before.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing either 'yes', 'no', or a single 'no', followed by an additional 'no'. `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string.**
