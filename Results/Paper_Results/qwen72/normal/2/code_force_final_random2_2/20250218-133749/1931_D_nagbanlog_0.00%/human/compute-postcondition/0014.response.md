Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `beautiful_count` is `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.** 

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value found in the dictionary `freq` at the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `beautiful_count` is now the value of `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`.
