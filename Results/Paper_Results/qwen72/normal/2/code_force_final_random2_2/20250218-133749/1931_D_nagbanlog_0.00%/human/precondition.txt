t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and a. n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, x and y are integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) representing Polycarp's favorite integers, and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
