Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples.
   - `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is 0.
   - `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
   - `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
   - `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
   - `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least one element.
   - `freq` is a dictionary where `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1.
   - `beautiful_count` remains 0.
   - `num` is the second element in `a`.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - **`num`**: This is the second element in the array `a`.
   - **`mod_x`**: This is the result of `num % x`.
   - **`mod_y`**: This is the result of `num % y`.
   - **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - **`required_mod_y`**: This is the same as `mod_y`.

4. **Example Values:**
   - Let's assume `test_cases` is `[({}, {}), ({'params': [5, 3, 2], 'array': [1, 4, 6]}, {})]`.
   - Here, `case` is the second tuple: `{'params': [5, 3, 2], 'array': [1, 4, 6]}`.
   - `n` is 5, `x` is 3, `y` is 2.
   - `a` is `[1, 4, 6]`.
   - `num` is the second element in `a`, so `num` is 4.
   - `mod_x` is `4 % 3`, which is 1.
   - `mod_y` is `4 % 2`, which is 0.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(3 - 1) % 3`, which is 2.
   - `required_mod_y` is `0`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the following values:
     - `Number: 4`
     - `mod_x: 1`
     - `mod_y: 0`
     - `required_mod_x: 2`
     - `required_mod_y: 0`

Output: **Number: 4, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 0, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 0**
