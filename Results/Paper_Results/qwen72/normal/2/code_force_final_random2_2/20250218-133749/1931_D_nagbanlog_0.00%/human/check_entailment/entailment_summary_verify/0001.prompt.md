You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to count the number of "beautiful" pairs in the list `a`. A "beautiful" pair `(a[i], a[j])` is defined as a pair where `i < j` and both `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of "beautiful" pairs for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and the following conditions are met:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the remainders when elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It iterates through the array `a` and calculates the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make a pair beautiful.
   - If the required remainders are already in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current remainders.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize `freq` and `beautiful_count`.
   - **Iterate through the array**: For each element `num` in the array:
     - Calculate `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
     - Calculate `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`.
     - Check if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq` and update `beautiful_count` if it is.
     - Update `freq` with the current remainders.
   - **Output**: Append the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The frequency dictionary ensures efficient counting of pairs.
   - The modulo operations and required remainders are calculated correctly.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) per test case, where \(n\) is the length of the array.
   - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the frequency dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The algorithm is efficient and handles the constraints specified in the problem description.
