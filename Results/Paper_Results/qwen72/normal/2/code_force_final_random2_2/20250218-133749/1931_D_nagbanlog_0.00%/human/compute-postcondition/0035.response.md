Output State: **`num` is the next element in `a`, `a` must have at least one more element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.** 

The value of `required_mod_y` is now equal to the value of `mod_y`, which is `num % y`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
