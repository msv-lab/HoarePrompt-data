Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic for counting beautiful pairs in the provided program is flawed. The issue lies in how it calculates `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`. Specifically, the calculation of `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` should ensure that both conditions for a beautiful pair are met:

1. \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \).
2. \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by \( y \).

However, the current implementation incorrectly assumes that the required modulo values for a pair to be beautiful can be derived directly from the current number's modulo values. This is not correct because the conditions for a beautiful pair involve two different numbers, and their combined properties must be checked.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to iterate through the array and for each element, check all subsequent elements to see if they form a beautiful pair. However, this approach would be inefficient with a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \). A more efficient approach involves using a frequency dictionary to store the counts of pairs that satisfy the conditions, but the logic for calculating these pairs needs to be adjusted.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0 and (a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0:
                    beautiful_count += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

This version iterates through all pairs of indices and checks the conditions directly, ensuring the correct count of beautiful pairs. However, for large inputs, this approach might be too slow. A more optimized approach would involve precomputing the necessary conditions and using a frequency dictionary to count pairs efficiently.
