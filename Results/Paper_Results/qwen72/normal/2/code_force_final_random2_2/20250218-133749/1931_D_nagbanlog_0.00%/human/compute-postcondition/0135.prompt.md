Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, y, and a list a. For each tuple, n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), x and y are integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = {}
    beautiful_count = 0
    print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        print(
            f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
            )
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
    results.append(beautiful_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is still a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the iteration, `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number by adding a non-negative integer less than `x` such that the resulting number is divisible by `x` and has the same remainder when divided by `y` as the original number.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is `beautiful_count`, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the modulus results of each element in `a` with `x` and `y`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair appears in `a`. `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in `a`, where a "beautiful" pair is defined as a pair of elements `(a[i], a[j])` such that `i < j` and `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples, `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing three elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, and the third element is `beautiful_count`, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and its value is the count of how many times the corresponding `mod_x` and `mod_y` occurred in the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that the sum of their required modifications to `x` and `y` results in a pair that exists in `freq`. The variables `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` will hold the values corresponding to the last element processed in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
