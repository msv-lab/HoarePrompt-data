Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in each `a` array, where a "beautiful" pair is defined as a pair of elements `(a[i], a[j])` such that `i < j` and both `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`.**
