### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and the following conditions are met:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the remainders when elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It iterates through the array `a` and calculates the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make a pair beautiful.
   - If the required remainders are already in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current remainders.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize `freq` and `beautiful_count`.
   - **Iterate through the array**: For each element `num` in the array:
     - Calculate `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
     - Calculate `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`.
     - Check if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq` and update `beautiful_count` if it is.
     - Update `freq` with the current remainders.
   - **Output**: Append the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

4. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the function's behavior.
   - However, there is a minor discrepancy in the problem statement interpretation:
     - The condition should be \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\), not \(a_i + x\) and \(a_i + y\).

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly calculates the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element.
   - The required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are calculated correctly.
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used efficiently to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - The logic for updating `beautiful_count` is correct.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The frequency dictionary ensures efficient counting of pairs.
   - The modulo operations and required remainders are calculated correctly.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) per test case, where \(n\) is the length of the array.
   - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the frequency dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The algorithm is efficient and handles the constraints specified in the problem description. The minor discrepancy in the function summary does not affect the correctness of the implementation.

Final: **True**
