Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple.
- `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
- `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over.
- `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the iteration.
- `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number by adding a non-negative integer less than `x` such that the resulting number is divisible by `x` and has the same remainder when divided by `y` as the original number.

The `print` statement will output the value of `beautiful_count`, which is the total count of "beautiful" numbers in the array `a`.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the total count of numbers in the array `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number as described)**
