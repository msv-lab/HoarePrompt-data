Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples.
- `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, both initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
- `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` as they are defined in the third tuple of `test_cases`.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where [n], [x], and [y] are the first, second, and third values from the 'params' key of the third tuple in `test_cases`, and [a] is the array from the 'array' key of the third tuple in `test_cases`)**
