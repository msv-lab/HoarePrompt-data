The code snippet updates the `beautiful_count` variable by adding the value found in the `freq` dictionary at the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`. The values of `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are derived from the current value of `num` and the constants `x` and `y`.

- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, where `mod_x` is `num % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y`, which is `num % y`.

The `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`num` is the next element in `a`, `a` must have at least one more element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[(x - (num % x)) % x, num % y]`.**
