The code snippet updates the `beautiful_count` variable by adding the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to it. Let's break down the impact:

- `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, `freq`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples, `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is a non-empty list, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] + 1`, and `beautiful_count` is `beautiful_count + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.**
