The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in `a` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element, and `num` should be the first element of `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is the first element of `a`**
