To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples.
- `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 0.
- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
- `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for num in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `num` and the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `num` will be the first element of `a` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
- `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` remains a list of tuples containing at least three tuples.
- `case` remains the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- `results` remains a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 0.
- `n` remains the first value from `case['params']`.
- `x` remains the second value from `case['params']`.
- `y` remains the third value from `case['params']`.
- `a` must have at least one element.
- `freq` remains an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` remains 0.
- `num` is the first element of `a`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples, `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is the first element of `a`**
