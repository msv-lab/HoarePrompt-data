Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` for each test case, where a beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries, each containing `params` and `array`).
2. **Frequency Dictionary**: A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\), where \(\text{mod}_x\) is the remainder when an element is divided by \(x\) and \(\text{mod}_y\) is the remainder when an element is divided by \(y\).
3. **Required Moduli Calculation**: For each element `num` in the array `a`, the program calculates the required moduli `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` to form a beautiful pair with another element.
4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: If the required moduli pair \((\text{required_mod_x}, \text{required_mod_y})\) is already in the frequency dictionary, it means there are existing elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element. The count of such pairs is added to `beautiful_count`.
5. **Updating Frequency Dictionary**: The frequency of the current element's moduli pair is updated in the dictionary.

### Analysis:
- **Correct Logic for Beautiful Pairs**: The logic for calculating the required moduli and checking the frequency dictionary is correct. It ensures that the conditions for a beautiful pair are met.
- **Efficiency**: The use of a frequency dictionary allows the program to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs without nested loops, which is crucial for large arrays.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there are no beautiful pairs in the array.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The state transitions and final output are consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
