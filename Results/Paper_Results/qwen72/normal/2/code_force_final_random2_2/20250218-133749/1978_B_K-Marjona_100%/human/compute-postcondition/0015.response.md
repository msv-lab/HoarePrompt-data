The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This operation updates the values of these variables, and the initial conditions about `k` being defined based on the relationship between `a` and `b` are not yet applied because the code snippet does not include that logic.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer.**
