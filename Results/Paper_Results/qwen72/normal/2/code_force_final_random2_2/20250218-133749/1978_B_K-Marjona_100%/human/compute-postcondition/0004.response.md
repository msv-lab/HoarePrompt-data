Based on the initial state:

- `_` is a placeholder and not used in the calculation.
- `n` is an integer.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer, and it is given that `b` is less than or equal to `a`.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer and `b <= a`.
   - `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Relevant Calculation:**
   - The expression `a * n` multiplies the integer `a` by the integer `n`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print` statement will output the result of the multiplication `a * n`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * n (where `a` is the value of `a` and `n` is the value of `n`)**
