Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `a` is the second input integer.
- `b` is the third input integer.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, but it is not used in the print statement.

2. **Determine the Expression:**
   - The print statement calculates `a * n`.
   - This means the product of the second input integer `a` and the first input integer `n` will be printed.

### Final Output:
The code will print the product of the second input integer `a` and the first input integer `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a is the second input integer and n is the first input integer)**
