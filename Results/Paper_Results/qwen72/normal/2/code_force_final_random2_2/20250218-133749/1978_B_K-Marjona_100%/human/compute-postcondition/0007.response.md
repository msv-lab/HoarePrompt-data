Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, which is always `b - a` because `b - a` is non-positive. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.***
