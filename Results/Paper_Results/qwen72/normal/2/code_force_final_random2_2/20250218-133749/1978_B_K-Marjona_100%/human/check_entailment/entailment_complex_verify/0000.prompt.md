You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer input initially provided. For each iteration, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from input, and `k` is calculated as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output is `a * n`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the output is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates a value based on these inputs and prints the result. Specifically, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, and prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum profit by considering both the scenario where the buns are sold at the usual price and the scenario where they are sold at the modified price. The logic for determining the value of `k` and calculating the total profit is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements. No edge cases or inputs violate the expected behavior of the program.
