The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This changes the values of these variables from their initial state to the new values provided by the input.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is a placeholder (not affected by the code).
- `n` is an integer.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

After executing the code:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the input.
- The value of `k` is recalculated based on the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is `b - a` (which is non-positive). If `b` is greater than `a`, then `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**
