Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly addresses the problem by calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling all the buns. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns or the difference between the promotional price and the regular price.
3. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means the promotional price is not beneficial, so Bob sells all buns at the regular price `a`, resulting in a profit of `a * n`.
4. Otherwise, it calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the promotional prices `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from 1 to `k`, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the regular price `a`.

The formula used to calculate the profit from the promotional buns is correct: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`, which accounts for the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`. The remaining buns are sold at the regular price, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the total profit.

Thus, the program correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case, making it a correct solution.
