The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain valid. Since `math.gcd(x, y)` (which is `math.gcd(3, 3)`) is not equal to 1, the condition for setting `cnt` to 1 does not apply.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is increased by 1.**
