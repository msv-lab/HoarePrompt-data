To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The conditions in the loop head depend on `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` is at least 20.
   - `x` and `y` are integers.
   - `y` is increased by 2.
   - `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.
   - `n` and `m` must be large enough to satisfy `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must still hold true after the previous iteration.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `y` is increased by 2, the new value of `y` will be `y + 2`.
   - We need to ensure that `(x + (y + 2)) * x <= n` and `(x + (y + 2)) * (y + 2) <= m`.

5. **Ensuring the Conditions:**
   - The condition `(x + (y + 2)) * x <= n` simplifies to `(x + y + 2) * x <= n`.
   - The condition `(x + (y + 2)) * (y + 2) <= m` simplifies to `(x + y + 2) * (y + 2) <= m`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` and `m` must be large enough to satisfy the new conditions `(x + y + 2) * x <= n` and `(x + y + 2) * (y + 2) <= m`.

### Final State:
Since the only variables that can be adjusted are those in the loop head, and the conditions depend on `n` and `m`, we need to ensure that `n` and `m` are large enough to satisfy the new conditions.

State: **`n` is at least 20, `x` and `y` are integers, `y` is increased by 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, and `n` and `m` must be large enough to satisfy `(x + y + 2) * x <= n` and `(x + y + 2) * (y + 2) <= m`**.
