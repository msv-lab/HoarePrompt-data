To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 3
   - `y` is 1
   - `n` and `m` are input integers
   - `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each pair `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and the loop condition is satisfied.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.
   - Substituting the initial values:
     - `(x + y) * x = (3 + 1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`
     - `(x + y) * y = (3 + 1) * 1 = 4 * 1 = 4`
   - Therefore, the loop condition becomes:
     - `12 <= n and 4 <= m`

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions `12 <= n` and `4 <= m` must be true.
   - This means `n` must be at least 12 and `m` must be at least 4.

### Final State:
The state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is at least 12 and `m` is at least 4. The other variables (`x`, `y`, and `cnt`) do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 4, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each pair `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and the loop condition is satisfied.**
