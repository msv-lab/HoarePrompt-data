The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must still be greater than 0, as the loop iterates `t` times. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and simply increments with each iteration, we don't need to explicitly track its value. However, for the loop to continue, `t` must still be greater than the number of iterations completed so far.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but since the loop variable `_` is incremented implicitly, we can consider that one iteration has passed, reducing the remaining iterations by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `t` must be greater than 0 (one iteration has passed, so `t` is now effectively `t - 1`)**
