### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
     - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
     - It iterates over `x` while \(x \times x \le n\).
     - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` while \((x + y) \times x \le n\) and \((x + y) \times y \le m\).
     - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \right\rfloor\).
     - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - The function reads an integer \(t\) from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It calls `func_1` exactly \(t\) times.

3. **Annotated Code Verification**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The conditions \((x + y) \times x \le n\) and \((x + y) \times y \le m\) ensure that the pairs \((a, b)\) are within the specified ranges.
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime, which is necessary for the problem's constraints.
   - The increment of `cnt` by the minimum of the two quotients ensures that the pairs \((a, b)\) satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\) correctly, as it outputs 0.
   - The program also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) as shown in the example test cases.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.
   - The original assessment is accurate.
