Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. This ensures that the program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

2. **Pair Generation and Conditions**: In `func_1()`, the program generates pairs `(x, y)` and checks if they satisfy the conditions:
   - \(1 \le x \le n\) and \(1 \le y \le m\).
   - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program uses `math.gcd(x, y)` to calculate the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.

4. **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is checked using the expression `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`. This is because if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = b\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\). The program correctly increments the count `cnt` when this condition is met.

5. **Loop Termination**: The loops terminate correctly:
   - The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \le n\).
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).

6. **Output**: The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
