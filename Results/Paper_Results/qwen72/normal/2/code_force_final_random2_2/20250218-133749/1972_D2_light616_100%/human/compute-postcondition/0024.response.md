To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 12
- `m` must be at least 4
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each pair `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and the loop condition is satisfied.
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1.

### Code:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x + y`:**
   - `x + y = 3 + 1 = 4`

2. **Calculate `(x + y) * x`:**
   - `(x + y) * x = 4 * 3 = 12`

3. **Calculate `(x + y) * y`:**
   - `(x + y) * y = 4 * 1 = 4`

4. **Calculate `n // ((x + y) * x)`:**
   - `n // 12` (since `n` is at least 12, this will be at least 1)

5. **Calculate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:**
   - `m // 4` (since `m` is at least 4, this will be at least 1)

6. **Determine the minimum of the two results:**
   - `min(n // 12, m // 4)` (both are at least 1, so the minimum is 1)

7. **Update `cnt`:**
   - `cnt += 1`

### Output State:
- `n` must be at least 12
- `m` must be at least 4
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is increased by 1

Output State: **`n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 4, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by 1**
