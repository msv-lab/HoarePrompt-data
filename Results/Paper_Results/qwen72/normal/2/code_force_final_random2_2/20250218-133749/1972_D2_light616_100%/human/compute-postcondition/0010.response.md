To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

The variables involved in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. The loop will continue as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the current state:
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `m` is greater than or equal to 2

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n` becomes `(1 + 2) * 1 <= n` which simplifies to `3 <= n`.
2. `(x + y) * y <= m` becomes `(1 + 2) * 2 <= m` which simplifies to `6 <= m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 6.

Since the current state specifies that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `m` is greater than or equal to 2, we need to adjust these values to ensure the loop can proceed.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 6.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the input integers, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6**
