### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - Initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
     - Reads `n` and `m` from input.
     - Iterates over `x` while \(x \times x \le n\).
     - For each `x`, iterates over `y` while \((x + y) \times x \le n\) and \((x + y) \times y \le m\).
     - Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
     - If true, increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(n // ((x + y) \times x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \times y)\).
     - Prints `cnt`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, calls `func_1`.

3. **Annotated Code Verification**:
   - The annotated code confirms that `n` and `m` are read correctly and are within the specified range.
   - The loop conditions ensure that `x` and `y` are within the bounds defined by `n` and `m`.
   - The gcd check ensures that the pairs \((x, y)\) are coprime.
   - The increment of `cnt` by the minimum of the two quotients ensures that the conditions are met for the pairs.

4. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The gcd check and the conditions within the loops ensure that the pairs \((a, b)\) satisfy the given conditions.
   - The program correctly counts the valid pairs and prints the result for each test case.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The use of gcd and the loop conditions are appropriate for finding the valid pairs.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
