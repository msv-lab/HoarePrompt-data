### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - The function iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are potential values for \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
     - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the main condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
     - The inner loop checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
     - If the gcd condition is met, it counts the number of valid pairs using `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
     - However, the main condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not directly checked in the code. The code assumes that if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, the condition will hold, which is not always true.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not fully capture the required condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The use of `math.gcd` to ensure coprimality is a good start, but it is not sufficient to guarantee the main condition.
   - The counting mechanism using `min` ensures that the pairs are within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\), but it does not ensure the main condition is met.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This structure is correct for handling multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1, m = 1\)).
   - The constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\) are respected by the loops and conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It fails to check the main condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) and instead relies on a weaker condition of coprimality, which is insufficient.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
