Reasoning:

The annotated program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function is designed to handle a list of strings (`path`) where each string is either `@`, `*`, or a digit. However, the problem description specifies that the input is a list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate a score based on the presence of `@` and `*` characters, which is not relevant to the problem of finding the year when the nth sign occurs.
   - The function returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which is not the correct approach for determining the year of the nth sign.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads input and processes multiple test cases, but it incorrectly calls `func_1` with a single string (`path`), which is not the correct format for the problem.
   - The function should parse the periodicities into a list of integers and then use a different algorithm to find the year when the nth sign occurs.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The correct approach would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities to determine the year when the nth sign occurs.

Correctness: **False**
