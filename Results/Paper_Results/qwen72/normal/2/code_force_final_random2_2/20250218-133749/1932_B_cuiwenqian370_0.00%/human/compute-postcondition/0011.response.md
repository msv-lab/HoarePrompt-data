The code snippet `results.append(func_1(path))` appends the result of the function `func_1` called with the argument `path` to the list `results`. Since the initial state specifies that `path` is the string at `data[2]`, the function `func_1` is called with this string. The exact value of `func_1(path)` is not specified, but it is added to the list `results`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at `data[2]`, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`.**
