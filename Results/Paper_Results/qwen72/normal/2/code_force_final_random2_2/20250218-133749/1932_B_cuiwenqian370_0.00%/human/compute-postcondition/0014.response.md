Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at `data[2]`, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the element at index 3 in the list `data`.
- All other variables (`t`, `data`, `path`, `index`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
