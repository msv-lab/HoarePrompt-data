You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of signs. path is a string containing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` processed, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at the last `path` processed, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` processed, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at the last `path` processed, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` is a list containing all the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly but is expected to process input related to multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of signs, and a string `path` containing space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function returns the result of processing these inputs, which is not specified in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
