Output State: **t is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, data is a list of strings, path is a string containing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, index is 1, results is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list called `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
