Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its current value, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at `data[6]`, `index` is 7, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` three times.** 

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list, which initially contains the result of `func_1(path)` twice. After the execution, `results` now contains the result of `func_1(path)` three times. All other variables remain unchanged.
