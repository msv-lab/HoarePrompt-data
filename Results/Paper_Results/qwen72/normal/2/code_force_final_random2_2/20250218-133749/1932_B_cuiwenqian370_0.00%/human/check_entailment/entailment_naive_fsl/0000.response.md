Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, considering the sequential nature of the signs. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve a different problem, specifically a path traversal problem where certain characters (`@` and `*`) are used to determine the score. This does not align with the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicity of the signs. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
