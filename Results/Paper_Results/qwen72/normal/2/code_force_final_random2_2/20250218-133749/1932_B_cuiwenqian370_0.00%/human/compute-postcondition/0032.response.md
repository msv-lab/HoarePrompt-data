Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` processed, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at the last `path` processed, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` is a list containing all the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `data`, `path`, and `index` remain unchanged from their initial or last processed states because they are not modified within the loop. The `results` list contains all the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop, meaning it now holds the complete set of results generated during the entire execution of the loop.
