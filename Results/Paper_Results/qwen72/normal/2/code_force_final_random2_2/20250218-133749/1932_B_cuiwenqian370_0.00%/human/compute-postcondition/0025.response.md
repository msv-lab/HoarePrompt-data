Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` processed, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at the last `path` processed, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations of the loop, `t` (which controls the number of iterations) is decremented to 0.
- **`n` is the integer value of the last `n` processed**: The variable `n` will hold the last value of `n` that was processed in the loop.
- **`data` is a list of strings**: The `data` list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`path` is the string at the last `path` processed**: The variable `path` will hold the last value of `path` that was processed in the loop.
- **`index` is the final index after processing all elements**: The `index` variable will point to the position right after the last element processed in the loop.
- **`results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop**: The `results` list will contain the results of calling `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
