Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is 0.
- `n` is the integer value of the last `n` processed.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `path` is the string at the last `path` processed.
- `index` is the final index after processing all elements.
- `results` is a list containing at least one result of `func_1(path)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `result` is being printed.
- According to the initial state, `results` is a list containing at least one result of `func_1(path)`.
- The variable `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is likely that `result` is intended to be an element from the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
- Since `results` is a list containing at least one result of `func_1(path)`, and `result` is being printed, the output will be one of the elements from the `results` list.
- Without more specific information about the contents of `results`, we can only say that `result` will be one of the elements in the `results` list.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is an element from the results list, and results is a list containing at least one result of func_1(path))**
