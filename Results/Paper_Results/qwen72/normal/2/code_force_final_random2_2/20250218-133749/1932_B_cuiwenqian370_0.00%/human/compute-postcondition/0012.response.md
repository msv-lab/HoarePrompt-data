The code `results.append(func_1(path))` appends the result of `func_1(path)` to the list `results`. The function `func_1` is called with the argument `path`, which is the string at `data[2]`. The result of `func_1(path)` is added to the `results` list, which was initially empty.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is now the string at `data[2]`, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at `data[2]`, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`**.
