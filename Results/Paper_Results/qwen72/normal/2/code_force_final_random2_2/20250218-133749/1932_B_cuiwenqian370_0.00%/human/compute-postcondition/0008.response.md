The code snippet `path = data[index]` assigns the value of `data[2]` (since `index` is 2) to the variable `path`. This changes the value of `path` from its initial state (a string containing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) to the value of `data[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the value of `data[2]`, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**
