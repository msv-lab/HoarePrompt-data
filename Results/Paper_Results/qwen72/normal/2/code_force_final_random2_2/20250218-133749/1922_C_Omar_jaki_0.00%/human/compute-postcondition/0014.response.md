Output State: **`t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with the second element of the previous state, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 5 elements, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is [0, 0, v, 0 + v], `v` is `y - x`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `v = y - x` assigns the value of `y - x` to the variable `v`.
- The initial state already defines `b` as `[0, 0, v, 0 + v]`, so after the assignment, `b` remains `[0, 0, v, 0 + v]` but now `v` is specifically `y - x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `queries`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
