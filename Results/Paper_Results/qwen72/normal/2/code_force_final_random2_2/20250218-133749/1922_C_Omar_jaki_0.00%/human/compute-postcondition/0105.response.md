The only variable in the loop head is `u`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `u`. If `u` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `u` must still be non-zero.

State: **`u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
