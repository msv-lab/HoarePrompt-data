Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 1, `j` is the length of the string `s` minus 1. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` minus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`.***
