Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `j` is 1, `count` is 1 or 2 (depending on whether the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`), and `flag` is False or True (depending on whether the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character is '1'). If `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, then `j` is 1 or 2 (depending on whether the condition `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'` is true), and `count` is 2 or 3 (depending on whether the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`).***
