Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. The function calculates the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` and subtracts 1 if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1'. The result for each test case is printed to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed. **
