To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`.

Given:
- `num` is a non-empty string.
- `tot` is 1 (though it's not used in the loop head).
- `i` is `len(num) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `len(num) - 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `num` remains a non-empty string.
- `i` is now `len(num) - 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`num` is a non-empty string, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2`**
