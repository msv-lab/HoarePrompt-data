### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - **Anna's Move:** Anna reverses the digits of a single number in the list.
   - **Sasha's Move:** Sasha concatenates two numbers from the list and inserts the result back into the list, reducing the list size by one.
   - **Winning Condition:** Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\). Otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of digits in the list initially is the sum of the lengths of all numbers.
   - Each time Anna reverses a number, the number of digits remains the same.
   - Each time Sasha concatenates two numbers, the total number of digits increases by the number of digits in the two numbers minus one (since one number is removed).

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**:
     - `tot` is initialized as the total number of digits in the list.
     - `cntvals` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in each number, sorted in descending order.
     - The loop iterates over `cntvals` in steps of 2, subtracting the number of trailing zeros from `tot`.
     - The function returns 'Sasha' if `tot` is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), otherwise 'Anna'.

   - **`zerocnts(num)`**:
     - Converts the number to a string.
     - Counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the number.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to simulate the effect of Sasha's moves. By subtracting the number of trailing zeros in pairs, it accounts for the reduction in the number of digits due to concatenation.
   - The condition `tot >= m + 1` checks if the final number of digits is sufficient for Sasha to win.
   - The function `zerocnts` correctly counts the trailing zeros, which is crucial for the main function's logic.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles cases where the list has only one number.
   - It also handles cases where the numbers have trailing zeros, which can affect the outcome of the game.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
