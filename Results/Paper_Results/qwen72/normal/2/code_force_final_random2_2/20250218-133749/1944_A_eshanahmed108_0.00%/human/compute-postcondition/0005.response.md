The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within a certain range, and `n` and `k` are integers to be read from the input.

After executing the code, `n` and `k` will have the values provided by the user input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
