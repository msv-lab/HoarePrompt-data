The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`, both converted to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `int(input())` is `t`

The code does not affect the value of `t`. It introduces two new variables, `n` and `k`, which are assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
