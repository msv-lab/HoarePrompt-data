The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the current iteration count. The loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the value returned by `int(input())`. Since the loop does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k` for its execution, these values do not need to be adjusted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. For the loop to execute one more time, the placeholder `_` will simply increment to the next iteration, but this is handled automatically by the `for` loop construct.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged except for the implicit increment of the loop counter `_`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
