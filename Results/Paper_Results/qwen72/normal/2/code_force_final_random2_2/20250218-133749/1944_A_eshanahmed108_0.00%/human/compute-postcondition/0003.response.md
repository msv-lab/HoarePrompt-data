To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the `print` statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**: The `print` statement contains a conditional expression `n if n - k <= 1 else 1`.
   - This means it will print `n` if the condition `n - k <= 1` is true.
   - Otherwise, it will print `1`.

2. **Evaluating the Condition**:
   - The condition `n - k <= 1` checks if the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1.
   - If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, the expression evaluates to `n`.
   - If `n - k` is greater than 1, the expression evaluates to `1`.

### Possible Outcomes:
- If `n - k <= 1`, the output will be `n`.
- If `n - k > 1`, the output will be `1`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic of the `print` statement, the output will be either `n` or `1` depending on the condition `n - k <= 1`.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1 (where n and k are integers read from the input)**
