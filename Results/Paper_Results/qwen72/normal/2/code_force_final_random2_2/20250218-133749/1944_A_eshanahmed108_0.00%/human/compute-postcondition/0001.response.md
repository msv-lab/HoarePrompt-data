The code snippet takes two inputs from the user, splits them, and maps them to integers, assigning these values to the variables `n` and `k`.

- `t` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `int(input())` was previously `t`, but this does not affect the current state since `t` is not reassigned.
- `n` and `k` are now assigned the values of the two integers provided by the user.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
