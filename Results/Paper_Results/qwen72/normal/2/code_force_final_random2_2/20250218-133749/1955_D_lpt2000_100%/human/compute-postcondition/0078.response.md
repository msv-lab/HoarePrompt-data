Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values from user input, `aa` is a list of strings where each element is a string from user input split by spaces, `bb` is a new list of strings where each element is a string from user input split by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection (minimum counts) of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `m` must be less than `n`, and `n - m` must be greater than 0. Additionally, the frequency of `out_aa` in `D` is greater than 0, and the current value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
