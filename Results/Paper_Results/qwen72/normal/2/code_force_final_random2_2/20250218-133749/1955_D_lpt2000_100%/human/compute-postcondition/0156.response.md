Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, and `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` remain unchanged, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged. If `C[in_aa]` â‰¤ 0, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and if `D[out_aa]` > 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` â‰¤ 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `D[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to 0. If `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and if `E[out_aa]` becomes less than or equal to 0, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.***
