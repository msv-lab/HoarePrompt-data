Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, and `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` <= 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `D[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to 0. If `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and if `E[out_aa]` becomes less than or equal to 0, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. Additionally, `C[in_aa]` is less than or equal to 0.***
