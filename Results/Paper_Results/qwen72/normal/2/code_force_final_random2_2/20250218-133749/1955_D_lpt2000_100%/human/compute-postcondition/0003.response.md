The code snippet `aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on whitespace, and converts each part into a string, storing these strings in the list `aa`.

- The initial state specifies that `nabors` must be greater than 0, and `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- The code does not modify `nabors`, `n`, `m`, or `k`.
- The new variable `aa` is created and populated with the list of strings derived from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `aa` is a list of strings derived from the input.**
