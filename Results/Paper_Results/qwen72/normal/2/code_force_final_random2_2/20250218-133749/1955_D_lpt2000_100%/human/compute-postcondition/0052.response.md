Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` was initially greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`. `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1. `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. All other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `E`) retain their previous values.**
