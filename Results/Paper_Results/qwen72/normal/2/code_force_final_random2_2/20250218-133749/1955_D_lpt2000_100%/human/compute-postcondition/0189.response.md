The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the length of array `a`.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n, representing the length of array `b`.
  - `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m, representing the required number of matching elements.
  - `a`: An array of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
  - `b`: An array of integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6.

The function returns a list of results for each test case, where each result indicates whether it is possible to find at least `k` matching elements between the two arrays `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and arrays `a` and `b`. For each test case, it returns a boolean indicating whether it is possible to find at least `k` matching elements between arrays `a` and `b`.**
