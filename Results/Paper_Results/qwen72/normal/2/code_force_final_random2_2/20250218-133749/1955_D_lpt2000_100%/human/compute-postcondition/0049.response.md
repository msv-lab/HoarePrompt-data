Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`. `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. All other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `pairs_in_D`, `E`, `C`) retain their previous values.**
