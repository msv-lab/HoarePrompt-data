Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the required number of matching elements. Arrays a and b contain integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_m respectively, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `nabors` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                pairs_in_D -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            D[in_aa] += 1
            pairs_in_D += 1
            C[in_aa] -= 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following changes occur:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `fnd` will reflect the total number of times `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution. The `D`, `E`, and `C` Counter objects will be updated based on the transitions of elements from `aa[m:]` into the sliding window and elements from `aa[:n - m]` out of the sliding window. Specifically, `D` will contain the intersection of the current sliding window with `bb`, `E` will contain the elements in the current sliding window that are not in `D`, and `C` will contain the elements in `bb` that are not in the current sliding window. The `pairs_in_D` will be the sum of the values in `D`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will remain unchanged, as will the lists `aa` and `bb` and the Counter objects `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `aa` and `bb` remain unchanged, `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` remain unchanged, `D` contains the final intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` after all updates, `pairs_in_D` is the final sum of the values in `D`, `E` is the final Counter object resulting from subtracting `D` from `cnt_aa`, `C` is the final Counter object resulting from subtracting `D` from `cnt_bb`, `fnd` is the total count of iterations where `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k`, and `_` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
