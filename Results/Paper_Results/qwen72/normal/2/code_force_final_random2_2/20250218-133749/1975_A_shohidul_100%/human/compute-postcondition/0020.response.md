Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is False, `i` is 1. If the element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, the elements of `new` are in non-decreasing order, and the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`. In this case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is False or `new_all` is False, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index 0 of `a` is not greater than the element at index 1 of `a`, the program continues without modifying any variables.***
