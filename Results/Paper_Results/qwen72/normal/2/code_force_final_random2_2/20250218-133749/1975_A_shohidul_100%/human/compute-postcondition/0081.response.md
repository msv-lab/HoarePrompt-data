Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `check_all` is `False` if any pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `True`. The loop will print 'YES' if there exists an index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]` and the sublist `a[i:]` is in non-decreasing order and all elements in this sublist are less than or equal to `a[0]`. Otherwise, the loop will print 'NO'.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, it checks if `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
- If this condition is true, it creates a new sublist `new` starting from index `i` to the end of the list.
- It then checks two conditions:
  1. `check_all_new`: All elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
  2. `new_all`: All elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
- If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
- If either condition is false, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
- If no such `i` is found where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, the loop completes without printing anything, and `check_all` remains `True`.
- After the loop, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates up to `n-1`.
