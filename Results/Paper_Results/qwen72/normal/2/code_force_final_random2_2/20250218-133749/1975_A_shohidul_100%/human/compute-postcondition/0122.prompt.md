Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, or if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the condition, the most internal loop or if statement is exited if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, or if both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. The most internal loop or if statement is exited if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, or if both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the program continues without modifying `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
