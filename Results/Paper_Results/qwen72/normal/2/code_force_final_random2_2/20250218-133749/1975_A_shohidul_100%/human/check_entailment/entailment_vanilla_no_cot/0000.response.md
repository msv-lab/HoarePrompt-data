Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping a prefix and a suffix. Specifically, the logic for checking the new array after the split is not entirely correct. The code only checks the first element of the original array against the new subarray and does not properly verify if the entire array can be made non-decreasing after the swap.

A correct approach would involve finding the point where the array breaks the non-decreasing order, splitting the array at this point, and then checking if the concatenated result of the suffix followed by the prefix forms a non-decreasing array.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-decreasing
        if all(a[i] <= a[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Find the point where the array breaks the non-decreasing order
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                break
        
        # Split the array at the break point
        prefix = a[:i]
        suffix = a[i:]
        
        # Check if the concatenated result of suffix + prefix is non-decreasing
        if all(suffix[j] <= suffix[j + 1] for j in range(len(suffix) - 1)) and \
           (not prefix or suffix[-1] <= prefix[0]) and \
           all(prefix[j] <= prefix[j + 1] for j in range(len(prefix) - 1)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version correctly identifies the point where the array breaks the non-decreasing order, splits the array at this point, and checks if the concatenated result of the suffix followed by the prefix is non-decreasing. This ensures that the solution is correct for all test cases.
