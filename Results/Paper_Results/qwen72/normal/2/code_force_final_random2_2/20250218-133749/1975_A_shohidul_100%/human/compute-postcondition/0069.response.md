Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `check_all` is set to `False` if `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
