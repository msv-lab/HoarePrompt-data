To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `check_all` is set to `False` if `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `check_all`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the print statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
