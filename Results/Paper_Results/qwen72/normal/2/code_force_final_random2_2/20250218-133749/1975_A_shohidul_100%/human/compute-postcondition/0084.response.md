The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new integer input by the user. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False` based on the previous conditions).**
