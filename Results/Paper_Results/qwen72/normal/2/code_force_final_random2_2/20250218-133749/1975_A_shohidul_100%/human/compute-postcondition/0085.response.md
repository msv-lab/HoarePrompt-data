The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into separate strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is a new input integer
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `i` is `n-1`
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `check_all` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False` based on the previous conditions)

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False` based on the previous conditions).**
