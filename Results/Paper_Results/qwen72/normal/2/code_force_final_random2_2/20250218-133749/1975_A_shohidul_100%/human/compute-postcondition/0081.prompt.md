Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is `True` if all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is set to `False`, and `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is also exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `check_all` is set to `False` if `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end. If `a[1]` is greater than `a[2]`, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, and `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. If either `check_all_new` or `new_all` is `False`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3, `check_all` is set to `False` if `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, and `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
