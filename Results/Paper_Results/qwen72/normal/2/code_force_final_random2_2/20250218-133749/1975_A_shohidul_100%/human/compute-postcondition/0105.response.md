Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `new_all` by checking if all elements in the sublist `new` (starting from index 2 of `a`) are in non-decreasing order.
- The value of `new_all` is now determined based on the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `_`, `check_all`, `new`, `check_all_new`) remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects the updated value of `new_all` while keeping all other conditions and values intact.
