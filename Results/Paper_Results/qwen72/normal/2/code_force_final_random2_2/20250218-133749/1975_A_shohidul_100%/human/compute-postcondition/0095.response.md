Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all_new` is `True`, `new_all` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
