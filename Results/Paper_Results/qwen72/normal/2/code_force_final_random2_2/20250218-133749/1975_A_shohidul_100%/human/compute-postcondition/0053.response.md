Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `check_all_new` is the result of the expression `all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`, `new_all` is the result of the expression `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`, and both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`.**
