Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `check_all` is False.
- `i` is 1.
- The element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`.
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is True.
- `new_all` is True.
- The elements of `new` are in non-decreasing order.
- The first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The conditions provided ensure that the list `a` and the derived list `new` meet specific criteria, but these criteria do not affect the output of the `print` statement itself.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned; it simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
