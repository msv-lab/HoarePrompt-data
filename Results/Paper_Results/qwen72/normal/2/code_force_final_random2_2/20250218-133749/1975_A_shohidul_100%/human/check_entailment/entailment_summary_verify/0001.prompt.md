You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then, for each test case, it checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing. If the list is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'. If the list is not non-decreasing, it checks if there is a valid split point in the list such that the remaining sublist is non-decreasing and all elements in this sublist are less than or equal to the first element of `a`. If such a split point exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

2. **Finding the First Out-of-Order Element:**
   - If the array is not sorted, it iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This is the point where the array breaks the non-decreasing order.

3. **Splitting and Checking the New Array:**
   - Once the first out-of-order element is found, it splits the array into two parts: `a[:i]` and `a[i:]`.
   - It then checks if the new array formed by swapping these parts (`a[i:] + a[:i]`) is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Specifically, it checks two conditions:
     - All elements in the new array `new` should be less than or equal to the first element of the original array `a[0]`.
     - The new array `new` itself should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The initial check for a sorted array is correct and efficient.
- The logic for finding the first out-of-order element and splitting the array is also correct.
- The conditions for checking the new array are logically sound but can be simplified.

### Simplification:
- Instead of checking `check_all_new` and `new_all` separately, we can directly check if the concatenated array `a[i:] + a[:i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n))
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:] + a[:i]
                    if all(new[j - 1] <= new[j] for j in range(1, n)):
                        print('YES')
                        break
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Final Correctness:
- The corrected program is more concise and maintains the same logic.
- The original program's logic is fundamentally correct but can be simplified.

Correctness: **True**
