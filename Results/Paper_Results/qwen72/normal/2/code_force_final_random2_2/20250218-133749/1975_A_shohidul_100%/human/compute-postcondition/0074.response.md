Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3, `check_all` is set to `False` if `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `new_all` based on whether all elements in the sublist `new` (which starts from index 3 to the end of `a`) are in non-decreasing order.
- The condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` checks if each element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element.
- If all elements in `new` satisfy this condition, `new_all` is set to `True`; otherwise, it is set to `False`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `check_all`, `new`, `check_all_new`) remain unchanged.
