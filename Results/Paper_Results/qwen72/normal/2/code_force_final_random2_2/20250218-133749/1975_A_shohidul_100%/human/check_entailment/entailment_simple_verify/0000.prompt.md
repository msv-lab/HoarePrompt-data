You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `_` is equal to `t` (the initial value of `t`), and for each test case, the conditions described in the initial and intermediate states are met. Specifically, for each test case, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, and the program checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing. If it is, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if there is a valid split point where the remaining sublist is non-decreasing and all elements in this sublist are less than or equal to the first element of `a`. If such a split point exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the splitting and checking of the array. Specifically, the program only checks the first instance where the array is not in non-decreasing order and attempts to split the array from that point. However, this approach may miss valid splits that could result in a non-decreasing array.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
2 3 1 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
Yes
```

Actual Output:
```
No
```

Explanation:
- The array `a = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` is not initially in non-decreasing order.
- The program will find the first out-of-order element at index 2 (where `a[1] = 3` and `a[2] = 1`).
- It will then split the array into `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`.
- After swapping, the array becomes `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is still not in non-decreasing order.
- The program will incorrectly output "No".

However, a valid split exists:
- Split the array into `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]`.
- After swapping, the array becomes `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not in non-decreasing order.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y = [5]`.
- After swapping, the array becomes `[5, 2, 3, 1, 4]`, which is still not in non-decreasing order.
- Finally, a valid split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`.
- After swapping, the array becomes `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is still not in non-decreasing order.

The correct approach would be to find the longest prefix and suffix that are already in non-decreasing order and check if the middle part can be placed between them to form a non-decreasing array. This is a more robust way to handle the problem.
