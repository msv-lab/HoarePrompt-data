To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
   - `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('YES')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `_`, `check_all`, `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`, the `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
