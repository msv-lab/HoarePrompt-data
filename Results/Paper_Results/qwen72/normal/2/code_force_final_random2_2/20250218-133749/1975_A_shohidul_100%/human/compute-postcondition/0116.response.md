Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is 3.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and variables, but none of these conditions or variables are used in the `print` statement itself.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
