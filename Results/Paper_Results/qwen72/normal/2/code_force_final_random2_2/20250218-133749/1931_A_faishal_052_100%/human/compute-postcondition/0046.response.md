Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 1, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = []` reassigns the variable `arr` to an empty list. This changes the value of `arr` from its initial sorted state to an empty list. All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`) remain unchanged.
