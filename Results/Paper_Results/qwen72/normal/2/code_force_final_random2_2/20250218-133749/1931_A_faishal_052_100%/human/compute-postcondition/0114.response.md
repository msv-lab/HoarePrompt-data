Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` is `[1, 26]` if `lex` was less than 28, `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex` was between 28 and 51 inclusive, and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is `[1, 26]` if `lex` (after reduction) is less than 28, `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex` (after reduction) is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26]` if `lex` (after reduction) is greater than or equal to 79, and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[]`, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` remains unchanged.***
