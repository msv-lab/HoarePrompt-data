Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is [1], `lex` is an input integer - 1, `j` is 0, and `lex` is less than 27.**

The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, making it one less than its original input value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition that `lex` is less than 28 is updated to reflect that `lex` is now less than 27.
