The code `arr.append(1)` adds the element `1` to the list `arr`. Let's consider the initial state and the impact of this code:

- `cases` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`.
- `j` is 1.
- `lex` is an input integer.

Depending on the value of `lex`, the initial content of `arr` is:
- If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the element `[1]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element `[26]`.
- If `lex` is between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), `arr` contains the element `[26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 52, `arr` is either an empty list `[]` if `lex` > 78 or contains the element `[26]` if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive).

After executing `arr.append(1)`, the new content of `arr` will be:
- If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` will be `[1, 1]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` will be `[26, 1]`.
- If `lex` is between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), `arr` will be `[26, 1]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` will be `[26, 1]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` will be `[1]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, `info`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 1, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` is `[1, 1]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` is between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[1]`.**
