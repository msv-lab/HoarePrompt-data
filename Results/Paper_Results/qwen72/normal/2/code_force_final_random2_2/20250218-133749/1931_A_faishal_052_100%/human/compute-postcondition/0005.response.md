The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute 2 times regardless of the other variables because the range is set to 2. The initial state of `i`, `info`, `arr`, and `lex` does not affect the execution of the loop. However, to ensure the loop can start, `j` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0**
