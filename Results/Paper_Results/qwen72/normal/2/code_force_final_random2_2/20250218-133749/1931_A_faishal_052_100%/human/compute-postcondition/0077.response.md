Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 2, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` was less than 28, or `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` if `lex` was less than 52. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is reduced by 26.
- The conditions for updating `arr` and `lex` remain the same as described in the initial state, but `lex` is now specifically updated to `lex - 26`.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, `arr`) remain unchanged unless their values depend on the updated `lex`.
