Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 0, `arr` is now [1], `lex` is an input integer less than 27.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so if the initial value of `lex` was less than 28, the new value of `lex` is now less than 27. All other variables remain unchanged.
