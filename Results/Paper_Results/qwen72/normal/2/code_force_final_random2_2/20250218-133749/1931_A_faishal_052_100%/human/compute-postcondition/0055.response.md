Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the element 26, `lex` is an input integer and `lex` is now between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive).**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.
- Since the initial value of `lex` was between 28 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), subtracting 26 from `lex` results in a new value of `lex` that is between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive).
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
