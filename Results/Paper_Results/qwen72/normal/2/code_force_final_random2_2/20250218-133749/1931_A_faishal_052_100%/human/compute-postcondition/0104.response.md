Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[26]`, `j` is 0, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[26]`, `j` is 0, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 79, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[]`, `j` is 0, and `arr` is `[]`. If `lex` is less than 28, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[]`, `j` is 0, and `arr` is `[26]`.***
