To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions.
   - `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Understanding `temp`:**
   - `temp` is constructed from the first three elements of the first array in the `info` list.
   - Each element in `info[0]` is converted to a character using `chr(info[0][k] + 96)`, where `k` is the index (0, 1, 2).

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `info[0]` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is `'a'`.
   - `chr(2 + 96)` is `chr(98)`, which is `'b'`.
   - `chr(3 + 96)` is `chr(99)`, which is `'c'`.
   - Therefore, `temp` would be `'abc'`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(temp)` statement will print the string `temp`.

Since the exact values of `info[0]` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given formula. However, if `info[0]` contains the first three positive integers `[1, 2, 3]`, then `temp` will be `'abc'`.

Output: **temp (where temp is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`)**

For the specific example where `info[0]` is `[1, 2, 3]`:
Output: **abc**
