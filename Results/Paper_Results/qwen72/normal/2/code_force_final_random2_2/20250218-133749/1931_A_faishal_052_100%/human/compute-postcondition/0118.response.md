The code snippet `lex = lex - 1` attempts to decrement the value of `lex` by 1. However, `lex` is not defined in the initial state, so this operation would raise an error.

Output State: **An error occurs because `lex` is not defined. `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1].**
