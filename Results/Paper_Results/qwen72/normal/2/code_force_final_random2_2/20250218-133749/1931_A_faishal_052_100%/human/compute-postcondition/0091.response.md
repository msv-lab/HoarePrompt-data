The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range value. Since the range is set to `2`, the loop will execute exactly 2 times regardless of the initial value of `j`. However, for the loop to start, `j` should be initialized to 0 because the loop iterates over the range starting from 0.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements both of which are the array `arr` (which was previously sorted based on the value of `lex`), `j` is 0, `arr` is now an empty list `[]`, `lex` is an input integer**
