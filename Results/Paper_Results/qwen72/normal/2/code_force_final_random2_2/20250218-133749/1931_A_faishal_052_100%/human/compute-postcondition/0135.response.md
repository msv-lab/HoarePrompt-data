The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the constant `3`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `3`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `j` is 1**
