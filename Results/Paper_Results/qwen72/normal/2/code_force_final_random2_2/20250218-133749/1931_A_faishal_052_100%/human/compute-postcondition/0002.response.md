The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. The state of `info` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution and thus does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list**
