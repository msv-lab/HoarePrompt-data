Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `lex` is less than 1 or greater than 0 and less than or equal to 26, and `arr` is [1, 26], [26, 26], or [26] depending on the initial conditions.**

Explanation:
- `lex` was initially less than 27 or greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52 or 26.
- After executing `lex = lex - 26`, the new value of `lex` is adjusted by subtracting 26.
- If `lex` was less than 27, it is now less than 1 (since 27 - 26 = 1).
- If `lex` was greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, it is now greater than 0 and less than or equal to 26 (since 52 - 26 = 26).
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
