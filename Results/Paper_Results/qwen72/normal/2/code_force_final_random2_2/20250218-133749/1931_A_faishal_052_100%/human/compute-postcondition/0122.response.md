The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` modifies the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from its current value. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `lex`. Therefore, we can only state that `lex` is updated to its original value minus 26. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2, `arr` is [26], `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
