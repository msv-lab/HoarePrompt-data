Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 2, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]`, and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, as specified by the code `lex = lex - 26`. All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
