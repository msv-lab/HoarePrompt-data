Output State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the `temp` variable by appending the character obtained from converting the first element of the first array in `info` (i.e., `info[0][0]`) to a character using `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
