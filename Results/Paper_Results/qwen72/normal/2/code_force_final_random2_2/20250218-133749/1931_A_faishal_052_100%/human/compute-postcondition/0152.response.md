Output State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is an empty string, `j` is 3, `range` is 3.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `temp = ''` resets the value of `temp` to an empty string. All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, `range`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
