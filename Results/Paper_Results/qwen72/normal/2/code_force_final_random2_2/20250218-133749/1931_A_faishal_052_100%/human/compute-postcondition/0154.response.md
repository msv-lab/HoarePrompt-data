Output State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][0] + 96`, `j` is 0, `range` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `temp` is updated by concatenating the character obtained from converting the value of `info[2][0] + 96` to its corresponding ASCII character.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, `range`) remain unchanged.
