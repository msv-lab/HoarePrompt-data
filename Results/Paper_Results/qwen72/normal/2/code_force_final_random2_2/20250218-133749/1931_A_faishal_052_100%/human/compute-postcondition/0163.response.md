Functionality: ** The function `func` reads from standard input a series of test cases. The first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) is provided, representing an encoded value. The function processes each `n` to determine and print the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, with each word printed on a new line. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state includes the variable `cases` holding the number of test cases, `info` containing a list of sorted arrays, each with three elements derived from the input, and `i` and `j` holding the last indices used in the loops. **
