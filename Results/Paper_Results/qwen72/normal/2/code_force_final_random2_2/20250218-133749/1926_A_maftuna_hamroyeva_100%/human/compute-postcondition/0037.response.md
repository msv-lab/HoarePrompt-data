The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` depends on whether `j` is 'A' or not. If `j` is 'A', then `h` was initially 0, so it becomes 1. If `j` is not 'A', then `h` was initially 1, so it becomes 2. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the value of `l` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the second character of `a`, `l` is 0 if `j` is 'A' and 1 otherwise, `h` is 1 if `j` is 'A' and 2 otherwise.**
