Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `cnt` is updated to [1, 0] if `c` is 0 or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of `s`.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the first element of `s` in the `cnt` list. If the first element `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, making `cnt` [1, 0]. If the first element `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, making `cnt` [0, 1]. All other variables remain unchanged.
