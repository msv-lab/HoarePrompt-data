Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the original `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 0s in `s` multiplied by the number of 1s in `s`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: The list remains unchanged as it is only being iterated over.
- **`n`**: Initially greater than 0, but after the loop completes, it will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 for each iteration.
- **`zeroes`**: Remains unchanged as it is the count of 0s in the original list `s`.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt[0]` will be the number of 0s in `s`, and `cnt[1]` will be the number of 1s in `s`.
- **`ans`**: The final value of `ans` is calculated based on the logic inside the loop. For each 0 encountered, `ans` is incremented by 1 if there are any 1s before it. For each 1 encountered, `ans` is incremented by the number of 0s minus the number of 0s already counted. This results in `ans` being the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in `s`.
