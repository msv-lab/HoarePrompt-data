Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `n` is 1.
- `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`.
- `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.
- `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in `s` plus the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `cnt`**:
   - `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s`.
   - `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.

2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - `ans` is composed of two parts:
     - The sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in `s`.
     - The product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in `s`.

3. **Sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in `s`**:
   - For each 0 in `s`, count the number of 1s that appear before it.
   - Sum these counts.

4. **Product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in `s`**:
   - This is simply `cnt[0] * cnt[1]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`:
- `cnt[0]` (number of 0s) = 2
- `cnt[1]` (number of 1s) = 3

- **Sum of the number of 1s before each 0**:
  - First 0: 1 (one 1 before it)
  - Second 0: 2 (two 1s before it)
  - Total sum = 1 + 2 = 3

- **Product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s**:
  - Product = 2 * 3 = 6

- **Calculate `ans`**:
  - `ans = 3 (sum of 1s before 0s) + 6 (product of 0s and 1s) = 9`

### General Case:
- `ans` will be the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in `s` plus the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in `s`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` calculated as described above.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in s plus the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in s)**
