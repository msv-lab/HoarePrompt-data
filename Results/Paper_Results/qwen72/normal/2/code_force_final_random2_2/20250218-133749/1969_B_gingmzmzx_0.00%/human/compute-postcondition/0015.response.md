The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` updates the value of `ans` based on the condition `cnt[1] > 0`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`.
- `c` is the second element of `s`.
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0] and `ans` is 0.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 2] and `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.

### Impact of the Code:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise it remains unchanged.

### Calculation:
- If `c` is 0:
  - `cnt` is [2, 0]
  - `ans` is 0
  - Since `cnt[1]` is 0, `ans` remains 0.
- If `c` is 1:
  - `cnt` is [0, 2]
  - `ans` is `zeroes - 1`
  - Since `cnt[1]` is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1, making `ans` equal to `zeroes`.

### Output State:
- If `c` is 0:
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements.
  - `n` must be greater than 0.
  - `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`.
  - `c` is 0.
  - `cnt` is [2, 0].
  - `ans` is 0.
- If `c` is 1:
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements.
  - `n` must be greater than 0.
  - `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`.
  - `c` is 1.
  - `cnt` is [0, 2].
  - `ans` is `zeroes`.

Output State: **If `c` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0], and `ans` is 0. If `c` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 2], and `ans` is `zeroes`.**
