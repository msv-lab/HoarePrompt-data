Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 2]. If `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes` + 1. Otherwise, `ans` is `2 * zeroes`.***
