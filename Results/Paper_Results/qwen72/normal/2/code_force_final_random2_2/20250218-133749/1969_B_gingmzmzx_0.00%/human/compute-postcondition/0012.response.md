Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `c` is the first element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [1, 0] and `ans` is 0. If `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 1] and `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.***
