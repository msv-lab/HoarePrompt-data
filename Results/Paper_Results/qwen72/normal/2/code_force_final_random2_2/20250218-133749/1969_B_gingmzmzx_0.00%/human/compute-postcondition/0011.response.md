Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - 1`, `c` is the first element of `s`, and `c` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `zeroes - cnt[0]`.
- Since `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, making `cnt` [0, 1].
- Therefore, `ans` becomes `zeroes - 0` which simplifies to `zeroes - 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
