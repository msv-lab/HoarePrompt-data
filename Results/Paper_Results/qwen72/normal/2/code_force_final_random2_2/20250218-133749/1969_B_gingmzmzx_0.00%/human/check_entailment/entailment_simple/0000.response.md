Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The logic of the program involves counting the number of zeros and ones in the string and calculating the cost based on the positions of these characters.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeros**: It counts the number of zeros in the string `s`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeros and ones encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to store the total cost.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it increments the count of zeros in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there are any ones (`cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is 1, it increments the count of ones in `cnt` and adds the difference between the total number of zeros and the current count of zeros in `cnt` to `ans`.

4. **Output**: After processing each test case, it prints the calculated cost `ans`.

The logic of the program is correct because:
- It correctly counts the number of zeros and ones.
- It calculates the cost by considering the positions of zeros and ones, ensuring that the cost is minimized by performing the necessary cyclic shifts.
- The final cost is computed correctly based on the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
