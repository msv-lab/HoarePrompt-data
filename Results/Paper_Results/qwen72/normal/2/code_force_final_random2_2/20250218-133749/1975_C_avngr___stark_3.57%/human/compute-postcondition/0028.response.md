Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t-1`), `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2, and `max` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]` if `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max`. Otherwise, `max` remains either 0 or the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, depending on the initial condition.***
