The code snippet `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the first element of `removed_item` from `current_profit`.

Given the initial state:
- `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0.
- `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added, and `removed_item` is not None.

Let's assume `removed_item` is a tuple where the first element is a numeric value (since it is being subtracted from `current_profit`). For example, let's say `removed_item` is `(10, 5)`, where `10` is the value that will be subtracted from `current_profit`.

After executing the code:
- `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order) with `item` added and the smallest element removed, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `removed_item[0]` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `k` is 0, `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added, and `removed_item` is not None.**
