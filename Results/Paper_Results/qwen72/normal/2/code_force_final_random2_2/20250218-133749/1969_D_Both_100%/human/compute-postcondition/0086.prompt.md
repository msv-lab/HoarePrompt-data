Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus), `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `combined` (a tuple consisting of a negated price and a corresponding bonus), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but may be missing its last element if `combined` was not empty, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is either an empty list or contains the last element of `combined` (a tuple consisting of a negated price and a corresponding bonus). `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but may be missing its last element if `combined` was not empty. `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 1. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the last element of `combined` that was popped, and `combined` is now one element shorter.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is either an empty list or contains the last element of the original `combined` list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus). If `combined` was not empty, it is now missing its last element. `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
