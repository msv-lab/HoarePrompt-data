Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but now missing one more tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `combined`, `current_profit` is updated to `func_3_result + item[0]`, `combined` is missing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values. If `combined` is empty, `current_profit` remains 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. Additionally, `item[0] + item[1]` is less than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_profit += item[0]` updates the value of `current_profit` by adding the first element of the tuple `item` to it.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
