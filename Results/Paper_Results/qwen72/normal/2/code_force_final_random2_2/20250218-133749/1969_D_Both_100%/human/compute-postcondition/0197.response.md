Functionality: ** The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases, each involving a set of items with associated prices and bonuses. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible profit by selecting up to `k` items, considering both the negative prices (Alice's payments) and bonuses (Bob's payments). The function prints the maximum profit for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the internal state reset for the next call, with `test_cases` reduced to 0 and other internal variables cleared or reset to their initial states. **
