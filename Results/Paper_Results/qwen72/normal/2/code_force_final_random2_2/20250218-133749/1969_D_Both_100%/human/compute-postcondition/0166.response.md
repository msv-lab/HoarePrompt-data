The code snippet `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` pushes `item` onto the heap and simultaneously pops the smallest element from the heap, which is then assigned to `removed_item`.

Given the initial state:
- `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order).
- `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined`.

### Step-by-Step Impact Analysis:
1. **Pushing `item` onto `heap`:**
   - `item` is added to the heap, maintaining the heap property (i.e., the heap remains sorted by the bonus values in ascending order).

2. **Popping the smallest element:**
   - The smallest element in the heap (based on the bonus value) is removed and assigned to `removed_item`.

### Updated Variables:
- `heap`: The heap now contains `item` and has one fewer element than before (the smallest element has been removed).
- `removed_item`: This variable now holds the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added.

### Unchanged Variables:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 1.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`.
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list.
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty.
- `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0.
- `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.
- `k` is 0.
- `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined`.

### Output State:
**`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order) with `item` added and the smallest element removed, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `k` is 0, `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added.**
