Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list with one element possibly replaced by `item`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k+3` elements, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was pushed out of `heap` when `item` was added, `current_profit` and `max_profit` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` function pushes `item` into the heap and pops the smallest element from the heap. This means that `heap` is updated to include `item` and exclude the smallest element that was previously in the heap.
- The variable `removed_item` is assigned the value of the element that was popped from the heap.
- The values of `current_profit` and `max_profit` remain unchanged because the code snippet only updates `heap` and `removed_item`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `combined`, `item`) remain in their initial states.
