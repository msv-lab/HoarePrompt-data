The value of `current_profit` is updated by subtracting the first element of `removed_item`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list with one element possibly replaced by `item`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k+3` elements, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was pushed out of `heap` when `item` was added, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
