t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and cases is a list of tuples, each containing four elements: n (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k (an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n), a (a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and b (a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
