Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]` creates a new list `neg_prices` where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in the `prices` list.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `combined`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged.
- The `neg_prices` list now contains the negated values of the elements in the `prices` list.
