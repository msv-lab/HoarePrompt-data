Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `k` is 0, `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined`. If the sum of the negated price and the bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by the bonus value of `item`. If the sum of the negated price and the bonus of `item` is less than 0, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`.**
