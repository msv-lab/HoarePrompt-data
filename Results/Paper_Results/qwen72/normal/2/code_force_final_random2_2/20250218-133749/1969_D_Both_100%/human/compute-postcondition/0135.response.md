Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after processing all items in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The line `bonuses = list(func_2())` updates the `bonuses` list to contain the values returned by the function `func_2()`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
