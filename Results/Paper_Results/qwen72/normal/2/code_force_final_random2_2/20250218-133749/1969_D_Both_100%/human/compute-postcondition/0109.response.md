Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list with one element possibly replaced by `item`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k+2` elements, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before the push-pop operation, `current_profit` is decreased by the bonus value of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `combined` must contain at least one element.**
