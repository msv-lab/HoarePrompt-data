The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 999 - T[0]], `i` is 2**
