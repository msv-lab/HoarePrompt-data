You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        a = a[::-1]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. It then computes a sequence of integers based on these inputs and prints the resulting sequence as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0. The final state of the program includes the processed results being printed to the standard output, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `line`, `T`, `a`, and `i` holding their respective final values from the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is done using a while loop that decrements `t` until it reaches zero.

2. **Array Initialization**: For each test case, the function initializes an array `a` with a starting value of 1000. This is a reasonable choice because it ensures that `a[0]` is greater than any possible value of `x_i` (since `1 <= x_i <= 500`).

3. **Array Construction**: The function constructs the array `a` by iterating through the input values `T` and appending `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to the array `a`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`. Instead, it should be constructing `a` such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`.

4. **Reversing the Array**: After constructing the array `a`, the function reverses it. This is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correctness of the solution.

5. **Output**: The function prints the constructed array `a` as a space-separated string.

### Correct Approach:
To construct the array `a` correctly, we need to ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`. One way to achieve this is to set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` for each `i` from 2 to `n`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `a_i` will always be greater than `a_{i-1}` and the remainder when `a_i` is divided by `a_{i-1}` will be `x_i`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input().strip()
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        # Initialize the first element of a
        a = [1000]
        
        # Construct the array a
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a.append(a[-1] + T[i])
        
        # Print the result
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: We start with `a[0] = 1000`.
- **Construction**: For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, we set `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`. This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = T[i-1]`.
- **Output**: We print the constructed array `a` as a space-separated string.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly construct the array `a` to satisfy the given conditions. The corrected program, as shown above, would be correct.
