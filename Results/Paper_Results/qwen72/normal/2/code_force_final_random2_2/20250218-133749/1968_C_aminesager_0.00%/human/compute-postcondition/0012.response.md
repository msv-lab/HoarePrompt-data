Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 999 - T[0], (999 - T[0]) - T[1], ((999 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]], `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as the difference between the last element of `a` (which is `(999 - T[0]) - T[1]`) and the third element of `T` (which is `T[2]`). The updated list `a` now contains four elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
