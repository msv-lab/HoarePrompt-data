The function `func` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given context, it is clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific parameters. The function accepts the following:

- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - An integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), representing the length of a sequence.
  - A list of `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500), where each `x_i` represents the remainder when `a_i` is divided by `a_{i-1}`.

The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n`. It processes these inputs and returns the result for each test case.**
