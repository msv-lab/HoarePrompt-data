Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the user input string, and the current value of `s` is "<".**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `mak`. Since `mak2` is already defined as being equal to `mak`, it remains 0 as well. The other variables (`pans`, `i`, `n`, and `s`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
