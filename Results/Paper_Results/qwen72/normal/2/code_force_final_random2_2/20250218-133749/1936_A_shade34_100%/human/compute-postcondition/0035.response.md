Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
  - If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[0]`.
  - If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`.
  - Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print the following values:
  - `'?'`: This is a literal string.
  - `mak`: This is 0.
  - `mak2`: This is 0.
  - `i`: This is 1.
  - `mak2`: This is 0 again.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
Output: **? 0 0 1 0**
