Output State: **After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `mak` will be the last value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to "<" during the loop's execution. If no such input was received, `mak` will remain 0. `mak2` is now equal to `mak`. `pans` will contain all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=". If no such inputs were received, `pans` will remain an empty list.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `i` will end up being `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop.
- The variable `mak` will hold the last value of `i` where the user input was "<". If no such input was ever given, `mak` will remain 0.
- The variable `mak2` will be equal to `mak` after the loop finishes.
- The list `pans` will contain all values of `i` where the user input was either "<" or "=". If no such inputs were received, `pans` will remain an empty list.
