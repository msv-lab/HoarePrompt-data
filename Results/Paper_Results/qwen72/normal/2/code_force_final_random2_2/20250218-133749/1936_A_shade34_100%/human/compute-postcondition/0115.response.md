Postcondition: ***`mak` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `s` is the new user input string. If `s` is "<", `mak` and `mak2` are both set to 1, and `pans` is [1]. If `s` is not "<" but is either "=" or any other value, `pans` is [0, 1] if `s` is "<" or "=", otherwise `pans` is [1].***
