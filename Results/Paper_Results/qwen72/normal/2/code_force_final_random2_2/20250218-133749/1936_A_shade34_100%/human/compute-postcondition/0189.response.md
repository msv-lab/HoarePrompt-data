The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `k` before the increment, making it `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be `k + 2` at the start of the next iteration, and `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 (from the previous value), `s` is the input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is equal to the value of `i`, and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` now includes the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.**

To simplify this based on the adjustment needed for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is greater than the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1` from the previous iteration), `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the input string, `mak` and `pans` remain as described based on the conditions of `s`.**
