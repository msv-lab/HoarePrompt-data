Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1` from the previous iteration), `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is '<', `mak` is set to `i`, and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `s` is not '<' and is '=', `pans` now includes the value of `i` appended to it. Otherwise, `mak` remains as described based on the conditions of `s`.***
