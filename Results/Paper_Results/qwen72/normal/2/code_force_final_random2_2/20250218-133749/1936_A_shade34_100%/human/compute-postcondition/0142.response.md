Postcondition: ***`mak` is either 0 or `n-1` based on the last user input. If the last user input is ">", `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0. `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution. `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is the input integer.***
