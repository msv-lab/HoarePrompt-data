Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `mak` is either 0, 1, or 2.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` must have at least 4 elements.
- `i` is 3.
- The standard output buffer has been flushed.
- If the input is '>', `mak` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 or 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `mak`:**
   - If the input is '>', `mak` is set to 2.
   - Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 or 1.

2. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Accessing elements in `pans`:**
   - `pans[mak]` will access the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list.
   - `pans[i]` will access the element at index 3 in the `pans` list.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **If the input is '>':**
  - `mak` is set to 2.
  - The print statement will be: `print('?', pans[2], pans[2], pans[3], pans[3])`.

- **If the input is not '>':**
  - `mak` remains 0 or 1.
  - The print statement will be: `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[3], pans[3])`.

### Final Output:
- **If the input is '>':**
  - Output: **? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3] (where pans[2] is the third element of the pans list and pans[3] is the fourth element of the pans list)**

- **If the input is not '>':**
  - Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[3] pans[3] (where mak is 0 or 1, pans[mak] is the element at index mak in the pans list, and pans[3] is the fourth element of the pans list)**

Since the input is not specified, we need to consider both cases. However, if we assume the input is not provided or not '>', the most general case is:

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[3] pans[3] (where mak is 0 or 1, pans[mak] is the element at index mak in the pans list, and pans[3] is the fourth element of the pans list)**

If the input is '>', then:

Output: **? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3] (where pans[2] is the third element of the pans list and pans[3] is the fourth element of the pans list)**

For the sake of providing a single answer, we will consider the general case where the input is not '>', as it covers the broader scenario:

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[3] pans[3] (where mak is 0 or 1, pans[mak] is the element at index mak in the pans list, and pans[3] is the fourth element of the pans list)**
