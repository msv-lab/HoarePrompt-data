The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `mak` is 0 unless the user input is a string equal to "<", in which case `mak` is 1**
