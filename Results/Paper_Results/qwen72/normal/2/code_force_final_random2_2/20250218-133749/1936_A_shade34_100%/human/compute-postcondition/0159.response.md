Postcondition: ***`mak` is 0 or `len(pans) - 1`, `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<", `i` is `len(pans)`, `n` must be greater than `len(pans)`, and the last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value. If the current user input is "<", `mak` is updated to `len(pans) - 1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
