The `print('##..')` statement simply prints the string `'##..'` to the console. The initial state provides information about the variables `casos`, `c`, `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal provided.

Output: **##..**
