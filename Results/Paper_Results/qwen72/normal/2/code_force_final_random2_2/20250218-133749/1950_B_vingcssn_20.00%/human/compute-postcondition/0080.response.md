The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides information about the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints a string literal `'..##..##'`.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'..##..##'` exactly as it is written in the `print` statement.

Output: **..##..##**
