Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `c` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to 1, 2, or 3.
- The current value of `n` is 4.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('##..##..')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'##..##..'` to the console. The values of the variables `casos`, `c`, and `n` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string being printed is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **##..##..**
