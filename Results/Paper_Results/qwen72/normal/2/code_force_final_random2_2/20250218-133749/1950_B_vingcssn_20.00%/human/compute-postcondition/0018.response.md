Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `c` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to 1.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- The current value of `n` is 3.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('##..##')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'##..##'` to the console. The values of the variables `casos`, `c`, and `n` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string being printed is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..##**
