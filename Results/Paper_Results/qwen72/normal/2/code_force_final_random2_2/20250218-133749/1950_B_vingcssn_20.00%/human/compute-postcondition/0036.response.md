The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `casos`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `c` and `casos`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `c` is less than `casos`.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0 and `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `casos` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`c` is 1, `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is 2, the value of `n` remains 2. If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is 4, the value of `n` remains 4. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.**
