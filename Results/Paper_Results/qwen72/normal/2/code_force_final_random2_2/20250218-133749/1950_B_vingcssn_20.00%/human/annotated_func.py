#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters but expects input from stdin where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) indicating the size of the checkerboard to be generated.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: `c` is `casos - 1`, `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is 2, the value of `n` remains 2. If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is 4, the value of `n` remains 4. For all other values of `n` (including any value not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4), the value of `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from standard input (stdin). It expects the first line to contain an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it expects an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) indicating the size of a checkerboard to be generated. Depending on the value of `n`, the function prints a specific pattern of `#` and `.` characters to stdout. If `n` is 1, it prints a 2x2 checkerboard. If `n` is 2, it prints a 4x4 checkerboard. If `n` is 3, it prints a 6x6 checkerboard. If `n` is 4, it prints an 8x8 checkerboard. For any other value of `n`, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value.
