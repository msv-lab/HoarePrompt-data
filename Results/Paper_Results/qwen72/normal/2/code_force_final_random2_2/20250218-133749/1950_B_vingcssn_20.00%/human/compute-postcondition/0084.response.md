The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

- The initial state provides information about the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The string `'..##..##'` is a fixed string and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'..##..##'`.

Output: **..##..##**
