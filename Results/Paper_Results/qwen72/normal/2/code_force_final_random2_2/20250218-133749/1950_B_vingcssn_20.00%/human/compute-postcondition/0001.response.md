The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `casos`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `casos`. For the loop to execute, `casos` must be greater than 0. The variable `c` starts at 0, as specified in the `range(0, casos)`.

State: **`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `c` is 0**
