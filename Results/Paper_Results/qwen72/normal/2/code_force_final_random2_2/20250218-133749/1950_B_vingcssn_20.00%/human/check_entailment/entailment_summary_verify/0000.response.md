Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func` only explicitly handles the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For any other value of `n` within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This behavior is incorrect according to the problem description, which requires the program to generate a checkerboard for any valid `n`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
