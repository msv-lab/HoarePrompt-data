Output State: **`c` is `casos - 1`, `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is 2, the value of `n` remains 2. If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is 4, the value of `n` remains 4. For all other values of `n` (including any value not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4), the value of `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `c = 0` to `c = casos - 1`, so after all iterations, `c` will be `casos - 1`.
- The value of `casos` remains unchanged as it is defined before the loop and is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `n` is determined by the input provided during each iteration of the loop. After the loop completes, the last value of `n` will be the one provided in the last iteration. If the input was 1, 2, 3, or 4, the corresponding patterns are printed, and `n` remains unchanged. If the input was any other value, the message "No esta en el rango" is printed, and `n` remains unchanged.
