You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters but expects input from stdin where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) indicating the size of the checkerboard to be generated.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:

    #State: `c` is `casos - 1`, `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is 2, the value of `n` remains 2. If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is 4, the value of `n` remains 4. For all other values of `n` (including any value not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4), the value of `n` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and iterates over each test case to read the value of `n`.

2. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - For `n = 1`, the function prints a 2x2 checkerboard with all cells as `#`.
   - For `n = 2`, the function prints a 4x4 checkerboard with the pattern `##..` and `..##` alternating.
   - For `n = 3`, the function prints a 6x6 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##` and `..##..` alternating.
   - For `n = 4`, the function prints an 8x8 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##..` and `..##..##` alternating.
   - For any other value of `n`, the function prints "No esta en el rango".

3. **Pattern Matching**:
   - The patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` match the expected output as shown in the problem description.
   - However, the function does not handle values of `n` greater than 4, which is within the problem's constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).

4. **Generalization**:
   - The function lacks a general approach to generate the checkerboard for any `n` within the range. It only handles specific cases explicitly, which is not scalable or correct for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not handle all valid inputs (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and only provides specific hardcoded solutions for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`.

### Correctness:
**False**
