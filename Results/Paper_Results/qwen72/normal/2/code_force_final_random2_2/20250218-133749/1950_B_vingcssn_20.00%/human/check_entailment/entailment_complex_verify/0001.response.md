### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and iterates over each test case to read the value of `n`. This part of the function is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - For `n = 1`, the function prints a 2x2 checkerboard with all cells as `#`. This is correct.
   - For `n = 2`, the function prints a 4x4 checkerboard with the pattern `##..` and `..##` alternating. This is correct.
   - For `n = 3`, the function prints a 6x6 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##` and `..##..` alternating. This is correct.
   - For `n = 4`, the function prints an 8x8 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##..` and `..##..##` alternating. This is correct.
   - For any other value of `n`, the function prints "No esta en el rango". This is incorrect because the problem description specifies that `n` can be any integer between 1 and 20, inclusive. The function should handle all these values, not just the first four.

3. **Pattern Matching**:
   - The patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` match the expected output as shown in the problem description.
   - However, the function does not handle values of `n` greater than 4, which is within the problem's constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). This is a significant limitation and makes the function incorrect for the given problem.

4. **Generalization**:
   - The function lacks a general approach to generate the checkerboard for any `n` within the range. It only handles specific cases explicitly, which is not scalable or correct for all possible inputs. A correct solution would need to dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern based on the value of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not handle all valid inputs (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and only provides specific hardcoded solutions for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
