Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) explicitly and fails to handle other valid values of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For example, if `n = 5`, the program will print "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This violates the problem description, which requires the program to handle any value of `n` within the specified range. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
