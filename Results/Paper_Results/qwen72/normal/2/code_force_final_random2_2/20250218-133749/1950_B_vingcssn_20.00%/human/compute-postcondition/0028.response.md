Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `c` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to 1, 2, or 3.
- The current value of `n` is 4.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'..##..##'`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:

Output: **..##..##**
