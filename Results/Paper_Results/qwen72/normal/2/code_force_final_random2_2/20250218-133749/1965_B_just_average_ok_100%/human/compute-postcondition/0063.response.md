Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is 1, `i` is 2, the length of `nums` is 21, and the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `idx` is 0 if `nums[1] > k`, otherwise `idx` remains -1. However, the code snippet `idx = i - 1` updates `idx` to `i - 1`.
- Given that `i` is 2, `idx` is now set to `2 - 1`, which is 1.
- All other variables (`nums`, `i`, the length of `nums`, and the values of `n` and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
