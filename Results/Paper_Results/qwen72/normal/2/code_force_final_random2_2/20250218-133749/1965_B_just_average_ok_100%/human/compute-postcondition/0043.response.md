The code `nums.append(k + 1)` adds the value `k + 1` to the end of the list `nums`. This increases the length of `nums` by 1. The new length of `nums` is 23. The value of `k + 1` is appended to the list, and the last element in `nums` is now `k + 1`.

The other variables (`idx`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`If no element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` remains -1, and `i` is 20. If an element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to the index of the last element that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is the index of the first element greater than `k`. The length of `nums` is now 23, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The last element in `nums` is `k + 1`.**
