Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. **`nums`**: A list of numbers.
2. **`k`**: A number used for comparison.
3. **`idx`**: Initially -1. If an element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to the index of the last element that is less than or equal to `k`.
4. **`i`**: Initially 20. If an element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `i` is set to the index of the first element greater than `k`.
5. **Length of `nums`**: 23.
6. **Last element in `nums`**: `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
7. **Element `1 << idx`**: This element has been removed from `nums`.

### Analysis:
- The length of `nums` is explicitly stated to be 23.
- The removal of the element `1 << idx` does not change the length of `nums` because the length is still specified as 23 after this operation.
- The last element in `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but this does not affect the length of the list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(nums))
```

### Explanation:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the list `nums`. According to the initial state, the length of `nums` is 23.

### Final Output:
Output: **23**
