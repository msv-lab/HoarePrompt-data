The input is split into two parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The input value must be greater than 0, so both `n` and `k` will be positive integers. The placeholder `_` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` and `k` are positive integers from the input.**
