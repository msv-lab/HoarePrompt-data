The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than the length of `nums`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `len(nums)` is 21. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `len(nums)` must still be 21 for the condition `i < len(nums)` to hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`nums` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 1, `len(nums)` is 21.**
