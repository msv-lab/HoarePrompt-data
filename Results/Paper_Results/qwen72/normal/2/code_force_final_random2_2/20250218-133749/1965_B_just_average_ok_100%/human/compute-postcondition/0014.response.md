Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are positive integers from the input, `nums` is a list containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is 1, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is updated to `i - 1`. Since `i` is 2, `idx` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
