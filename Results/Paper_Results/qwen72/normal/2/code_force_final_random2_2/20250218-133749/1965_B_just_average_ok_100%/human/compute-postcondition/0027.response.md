Output State: **`nums` is now a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets `idx` to -1, overriding its previous value (which could have been `i - 1` or -1). The other variables (`nums`, `_`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged. The value of `_` is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified. `n` and `k` retain their values as input integers.
