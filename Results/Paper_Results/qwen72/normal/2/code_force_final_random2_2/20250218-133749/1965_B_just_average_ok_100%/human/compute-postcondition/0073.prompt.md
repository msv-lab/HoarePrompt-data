Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
    idx = -1
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > k:
            idx = i - 1
            break
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is the original list with the new elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended to it, but with the value `2^idx` removed, and `idx` remains the same as it was before the code execution (either `i - 1` or -1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If no element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` remains -1, and `i` is 20. If an element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to the index of the last element that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is the index of the first element greater than `k`. The length of `nums` is now 23, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The last element in `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The element `1 << idx` has been removed from `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), followed by the value \(k - \text{nums}[\text{idx}]\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{nums}[\text{idx}] + 1\); `idx` is the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`; `i` is the index where `nums[i] > k` or 20 if no such element exists; the length of `nums` is 23; the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
