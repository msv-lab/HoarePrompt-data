To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers from the input (not directly relevant to the loop head).
- `nums` is a list containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- If `nums[1]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, `idx` remains -1 and `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the `nums` list.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The length of `nums` is fixed and contains 21 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than the length of `nums`.

### Conclusion:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- The length of `nums` remains 21, so the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 21.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are positive integers from the input, `nums` is a list containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` remains -1, `i` is 2**
