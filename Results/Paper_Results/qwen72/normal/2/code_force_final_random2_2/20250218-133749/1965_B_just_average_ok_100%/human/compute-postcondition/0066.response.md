Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`, `i` is the index where `nums[i] > k` or 20 if no such element exists, the length of `nums` is 21, and the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `nums`, which contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- The variable `idx` is set to the largest index where the value in `nums` is less than or equal to `k`.
- The loop breaks as soon as it finds an element in `nums` that is greater than `k`.
- If no such element exists, `idx` remains -1, and `i` will be 20 after the loop completes.
- The length of `nums` remains 21, and the values of `n` and `k` are unchanged.
