Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) followed by the value \(k - nums[idx]\) and \(k + 1\), `idx` is the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`, `i` is the index where `nums[i] > k` or 20 if no such element exists, the length of `nums` is 23, and the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values.**
