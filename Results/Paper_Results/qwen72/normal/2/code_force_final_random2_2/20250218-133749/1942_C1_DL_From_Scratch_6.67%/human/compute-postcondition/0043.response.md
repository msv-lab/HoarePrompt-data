Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned new values from the input, `y` is no longer 0, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `count` is the total number of times `num` was 1 during the loop execution, `num` is the last calculated value of `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` where `i` is `x - 2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 1, and `i` is `x - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `x - 1` times, so `i` will range from 0 to `x - 2`.
- During each iteration, `num` is calculated as `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.
- If `num` is 1, `count` is incremented.
- After the loop completes, `count` will hold the total number of times `num` was 1.
- The final value of `i` will be `x - 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, `_`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
