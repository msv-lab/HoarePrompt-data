To determine what will be printed by the `print(count + x - 2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned new values from the input.
   - `y` is no longer 0.
   - The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
   - `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `count` is the total number of times `num` was 1 during the loop execution.
   - `num` is now `n - list0[-1]`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `T` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0.
   - `x` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is `x - 2`.
   - If `num` is 1, `count` is incremented by 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `count` is the total number of times `num` was 1 during the loop execution.
   - `num` is calculated as `n - list0[-1]`.
   - `x` is the number of distinct integers chosen by Bessie.
   - `i` is `x - 2`.

3. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression `count + x - 2` needs to be evaluated.
   - `count` is the number of times `num` was 1.
   - `x - 2` is the value of `i`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The value of `count + x - 2` will be the sum of the number of times `num` was 1 and the value of `i`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the sum of `count` and `i`.

Output: **count + (x - 2) (where count is the total number of times num was 1 during the loop execution, and x is the number of distinct integers chosen by Bessie)**
