Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned values from the input split by spaces, `y` is no longer 0, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, and the current value of `num` is 1.**
