The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The conditions and values of `x`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that if `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1, this code snippet directly increments `count` without checking the condition for `num`.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`, `count` is increased by 1.**
