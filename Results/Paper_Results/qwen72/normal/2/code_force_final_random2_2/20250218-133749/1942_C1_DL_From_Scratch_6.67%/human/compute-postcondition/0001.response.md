To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder used to indicate that the loop index is not used within the loop body, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is an input integer
- For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0
- The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen

The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `T`. Specifically, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0, the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen**
