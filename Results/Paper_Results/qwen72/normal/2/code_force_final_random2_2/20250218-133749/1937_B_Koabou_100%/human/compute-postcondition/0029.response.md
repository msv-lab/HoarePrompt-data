The code snippet `y = i` assigns the value of `i` to `y`. Given that `i` is 2, `y` will now be 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list if the second character of the first string in `a` is not '1' or the first character of the second string in `a` is not '0'. If the second character of the first string in `a` is '1' and the first character of the second string in `a` is '0', then `s` is the first character of `a[0]` followed by the entire string `a[1]`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, and `i` is 2.**
