Output State: **`t` is `x - i + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` and `x` are not updated, `y` is not updated, and the current value of `y` is less than `x`. Additionally, the substring `a[1][i:x]` is equal to the substring `s[i + 1:x + 1]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `x - i + 1`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
