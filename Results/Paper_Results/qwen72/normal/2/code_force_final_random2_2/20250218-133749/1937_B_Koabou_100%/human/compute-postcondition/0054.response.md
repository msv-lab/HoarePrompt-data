Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input for multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it processes the strings to find a specific pattern and outputs a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The modified string `s` is constructed based on the positions where certain conditions are met in the input strings. The integer `t` represents the length of a matching substring found during the processing, or 1 if no such match is found. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results for each case. **
