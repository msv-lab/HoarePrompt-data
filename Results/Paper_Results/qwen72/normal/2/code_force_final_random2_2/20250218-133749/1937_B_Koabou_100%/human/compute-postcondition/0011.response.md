Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `y` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `y` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the same conditions for `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `x`, with the addition that `y` is now explicitly set to 0.
