Output State: **`t` is `x - (y + 1) + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` and `x` are not updated, `y` is not updated, `i` is `y + 1`, and the current value of `y` is less than `x`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to `x - (y + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `x - y`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
