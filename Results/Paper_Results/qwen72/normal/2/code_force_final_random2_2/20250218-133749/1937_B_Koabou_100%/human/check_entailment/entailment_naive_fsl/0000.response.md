Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are a few specific issues and a test case where the program fails:

1. **Incorrect Path Selection Logic**: The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string by comparing adjacent cells, but it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, it does not always choose the optimal path to ensure the lexicographically smallest string.

2. **Path Count Calculation**: The program calculates the number of paths incorrectly. It uses a variable `t` to count the number of valid paths, but the logic for updating `t` is flawed and does not account for all possible paths that could yield the same lexicographically smallest string.

### Test Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
0101
0000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
00000
2
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely produce an incorrect output because it does not correctly handle the path selection and path count calculation.

### Explanation of the Test Case:
- The lexicographically smallest string is `00000`.
- There are two paths that yield this string:
  1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)
  2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

The program fails to correctly identify these paths and their counts, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
