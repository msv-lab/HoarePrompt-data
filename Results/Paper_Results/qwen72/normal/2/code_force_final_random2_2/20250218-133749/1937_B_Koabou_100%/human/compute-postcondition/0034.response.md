Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings. If the second character of the first string in `a` is '1' and the first character of the second string in `a` is '0', then `s` is the first character of `a[0]` followed by the entire string `a[1]`. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is the first three characters of `a[0]` followed by the substring of `a[1]` starting from the third character, `x` is 2, `i` is 2, `y` remains 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` remains 0, `i` is 2, and `y` remains 0 or 1.***
