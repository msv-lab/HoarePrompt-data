Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` and `x` are not updated, `y` is not updated, and the loop has completed all iterations from `y` to `x - 1`. If at any point during the loop, the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` was true, then `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` where `i` is the index at which the condition was met, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `t` remains 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = y` to `i = x - 1`.
- For each iteration, it checks if the substring `a[1][i:x]` is equal to the substring `s[i + 1:x + 1]`.
- If the condition is true for any `i`, `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` and the loop breaks.
- If the condition is never true, `t` remains 1.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
