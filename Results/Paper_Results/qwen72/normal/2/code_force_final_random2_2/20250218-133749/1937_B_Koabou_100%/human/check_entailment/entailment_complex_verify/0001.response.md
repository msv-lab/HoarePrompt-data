### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the two rows of the grid.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It also initializes variables `x` and `y` to track the positions where the path changes from the top row to the bottom row.
   - The program iterates through the grid columns to determine the optimal path:
     - If the next cell in the top row is '0' and the current cell in the bottom row is '1', it updates `y` to the current index.
     - If the next cell in the top row is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row is '0', it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the top row up to the current index and the bottom row from the current index onwards, and sets `x` to the current index. This ensures that the path takes the lexicographically smallest string.
     - If no such change is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row and the last cell of the bottom row.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` to check if there are multiple paths that yield the same string. Specifically, it checks if the substring of the bottom row from `y` to `x` matches the corresponding substring of the constructed string `s`. If it does, it updates `t` to the number of possible paths from `y` to `x`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It prints the number of paths `t` that yield this string.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Path Construction**:
  - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct. The program correctly identifies the point where it should switch from the top row to the bottom row to minimize the string.
  - However, the use of `s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and `s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` is correct but could be simplified. The latter should be `s = a[0] + a[1][-1]` for clarity.

- **Counting Paths**:
  - The logic for counting paths is more complex than necessary. The program should simply count the number of positions where the path can switch from the top row to the bottom row without changing the lexicographical order.
  - The current implementation checks if the substring of the bottom row from `y` to `x` matches the corresponding substring of the constructed string `s`. This is correct but can be simplified.

### Simplified Path Counting:
- Instead of the complex loop, the program can count the number of positions where the path can switch from the top row to the bottom row without changing the lexicographical order. This can be done by counting the number of '0's in the top row before the first '1' in the bottom row.

### Corrected Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
    
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
    else:
        s = a[0] + a[1][-1]
        x = n - 1
    
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i] == '0':
            t += 1
    
    print(s)
    print(t)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was mostly accurate. The core logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string and counting paths is correct.
- However, the path counting logic can be simplified for better readability and efficiency.

Final: **True**
