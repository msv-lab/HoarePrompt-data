Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings. If the second character of the first string in `a` is '1' and the first character of the second string in `a` is '0', then `s` is the first character of `a[0]` followed by the entire string `a[1]`. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', then `y` is 2; otherwise, `y` remains 0 or 1. `x` is 0, and `i` is 2.***
