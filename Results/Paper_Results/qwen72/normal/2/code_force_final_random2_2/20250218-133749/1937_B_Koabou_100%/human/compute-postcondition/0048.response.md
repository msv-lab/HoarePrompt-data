Output State: **`t` is `x - (y + 2) + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` and `x` are not updated, `y` is not updated, `i` is `y + 2`, and the current value of `y` is less than `x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
