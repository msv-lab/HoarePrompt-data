Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` and `x` are not updated, `y` is not updated, and the current value of `y` is less than `x`. If the substring `a[1][i:x]` is equal to the substring `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`.***
