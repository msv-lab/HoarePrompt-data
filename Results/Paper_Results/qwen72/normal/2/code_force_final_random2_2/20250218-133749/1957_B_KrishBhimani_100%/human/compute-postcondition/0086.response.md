Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, `temp` is 4, `i` is 2, and `temp * 2` is less than `k`.** 

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
