Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, and `ans` is a list of length `n`. If `n` is 1, `ans` contains the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\). If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, followed by `n - 2` zeros.**
