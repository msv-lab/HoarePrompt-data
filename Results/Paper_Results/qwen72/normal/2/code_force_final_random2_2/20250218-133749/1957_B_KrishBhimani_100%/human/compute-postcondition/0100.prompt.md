Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    if n == 1:
        print(k)
    else:
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        ans = []
        temp = 1
        while True:
            if temp * 2 < k:
                temp *= 2
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
        ans.append(k - sum(ans))
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, and `ans` is a list of length `n`. If `n` is 1, `ans` contains the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\). If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, followed by `n - 2` zeros.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`, and `l1` is a list of strings from the input. If `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \(2^i - 1\), \(k - 2^i + 1\), and `n - 2` zeros, and `arr` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
