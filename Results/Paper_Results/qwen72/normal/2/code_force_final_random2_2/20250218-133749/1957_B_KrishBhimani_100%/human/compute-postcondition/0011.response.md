For the given task, the `while` loop condition is `True`, which means the loop is set to execute indefinitely or at least once without depending on any specific variable state. Since the loop is guaranteed to run at least once regardless of the current state of the variables, no adjustments to the program state are necessary.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1**
