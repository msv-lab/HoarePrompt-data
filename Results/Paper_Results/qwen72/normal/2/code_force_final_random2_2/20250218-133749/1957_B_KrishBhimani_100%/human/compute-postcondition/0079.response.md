Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 2, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, and the current value of `temp * 2` is less than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `temp` is updated to `2` because `temp` was initially `1` and the code multiplies it by `2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, `l1`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `temp * 2 < k` is still valid because `temp` is now `2`, and `2 * 2` (which is `4`) is still less than `k`.
