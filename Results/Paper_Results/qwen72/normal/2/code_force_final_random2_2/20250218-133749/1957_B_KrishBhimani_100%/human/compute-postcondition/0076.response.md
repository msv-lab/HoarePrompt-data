Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `temp = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `temp`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, `l1`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `temp` is now explicitly set to 1, replacing its previous value (which was the largest power of 2 less than `k`).
