To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
   - `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values \(2^i - 1\), \(k - 2^i + 1\), and `n - 2` zeros.
   - `l1` is a list of strings from the input.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it became greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it became greater than or equal to `k`.
   - The first element of `ans` is \(2^i - 1\).
   - The second element of `ans` is \(k - 2^i + 1\).
   - The remaining elements of `ans` are `n - 2` zeros.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `l1 = ["5", "10"]`.
     - `n = int(l1[0]) = 5`.
     - `k = int(l1[1]) = 10`.
     - `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than 10, which is 8.
     - `i` is the number of times 8 was doubled before it became greater than or equal to 10, which is 3 (since \(2^3 = 8\)).
     - The first element of `ans` is \(2^3 - 1 = 7\).
     - The second element of `ans` is \(10 - 2^3 + 1 = 10 - 8 + 1 = 3\).
     - The remaining elements of `ans` are `5 - 2 = 3` zeros.
     - Therefore, `ans = [7, 3, 0, 0, 0]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Output: **7 3 0 0 0**
