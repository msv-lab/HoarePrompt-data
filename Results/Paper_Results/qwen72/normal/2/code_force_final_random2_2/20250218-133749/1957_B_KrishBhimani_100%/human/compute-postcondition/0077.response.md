Since the `while` loop condition is `True`, the loop will always execute at least once regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`**
