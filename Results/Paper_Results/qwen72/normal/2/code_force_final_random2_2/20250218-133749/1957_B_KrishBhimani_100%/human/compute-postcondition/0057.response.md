Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `temp` is now 2, `i` is set to 2 if `temp * 2` was less than `k` before the multiplication, otherwise `temp` remains 1 and `i` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
