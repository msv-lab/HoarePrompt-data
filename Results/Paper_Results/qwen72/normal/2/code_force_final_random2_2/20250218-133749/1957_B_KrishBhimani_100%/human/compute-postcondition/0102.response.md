Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates and prints a list of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`. If `n` is 1, the function simply prints `k`. Otherwise, it constructs a list where the first element is the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, the second element is the remainder needed to reach `k`, and the rest are zeros, ensuring the list has exactly `n` elements. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the state of the program includes the number of test cases `t`, the values of `n` and `k` from the last test case, and the generated list `ans` for the last test case. **
