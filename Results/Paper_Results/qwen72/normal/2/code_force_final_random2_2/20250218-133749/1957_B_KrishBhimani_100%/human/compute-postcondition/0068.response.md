The code snippet `l1 = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, assigning this list to `l1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `l1` is a list of strings from the input
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `ans` is a list of length `n`
- If `n` is 1, `ans` contains the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\)
- If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, followed by `n - 2` zeros

After executing the code snippet:
- `l1` is updated to the list of strings obtained from splitting the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n`. If `n` is 1, `ans` contains the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\). If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, followed by `n - 2` zeros.**
