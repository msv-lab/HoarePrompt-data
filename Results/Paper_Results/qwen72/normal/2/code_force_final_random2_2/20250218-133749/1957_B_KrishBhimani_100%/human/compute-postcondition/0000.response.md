To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

### Loop Head:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains a single variable `_` which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter.
- The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer.
- Since `t` represents the number of test cases, `int(input())` should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

### Final State:
- The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0 (initially), and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**.
