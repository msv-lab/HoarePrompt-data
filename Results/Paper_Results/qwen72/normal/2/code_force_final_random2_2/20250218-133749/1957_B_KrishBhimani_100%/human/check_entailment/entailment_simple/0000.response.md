Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It splits the input into `n` and `k` and converts them to integers.

2. **Single Element Case**: When `n == 1`, the program correctly prints `k`. This is the simplest case and the program handles it correctly.

3. **Multiple Elements Case**:
   - The program initializes `temp` to 1 and iterates to find the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - It then appends `(1 << i) - 1` to the result list `ans`, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).
   - It appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`.
   - Finally, it appends `n - len(ans)` zeros to `ans` to ensure the list has `n` elements.

4. **Output**: The program prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, which is the correct format for the output.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 1`.
   - For `n > 1`, the program ensures that the sum of the elements in `ans` is `k` and that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the elements is maximized.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently finds the largest power of 2 less than `k` using a simple loop.
   - The construction of the result list `ans` is straightforward and efficient.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
