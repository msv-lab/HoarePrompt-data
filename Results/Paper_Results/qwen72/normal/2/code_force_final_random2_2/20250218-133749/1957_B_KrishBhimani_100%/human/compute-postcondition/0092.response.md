Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, `temp * 2` is less than `k` or `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, `temp` is 4 or 1, `i` is 2 or 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
