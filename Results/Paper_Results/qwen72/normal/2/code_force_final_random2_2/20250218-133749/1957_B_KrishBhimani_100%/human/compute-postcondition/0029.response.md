Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list. The variable `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to double the value of `temp` as long as `temp * 2` is less than `k`.
- Once `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`, the loop breaks.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
- The variable `i` will be the exponent of this power of 2, meaning `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
