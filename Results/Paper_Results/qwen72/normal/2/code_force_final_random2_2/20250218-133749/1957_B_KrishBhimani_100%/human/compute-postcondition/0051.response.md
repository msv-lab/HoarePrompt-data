Given the `while True:` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that need to be satisfied for the loop to continue executing. The loop will always execute the next iteration regardless of the current state of the program. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is 2 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` is 0, and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
