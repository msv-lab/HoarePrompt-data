Given the `while True:` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that need to be checked or modified for the loop to continue executing. The loop will run indefinitely unless there is a break statement within the loop body based on certain conditions.

Since the condition for breaking out of the loop (if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is 4 and `i` is 2; otherwise, `temp` is 1, `i` is 0, and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`) is already part of the state description, and this condition is met (as indicated by "we break out of the most internal loop or if statement"), the loop will not execute again unless these conditions change.

However, since the task is to modify the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, and given that the loop is `while True:`, no changes are necessary for the loop to continue running. Therefore, the state remains the same as described at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is 4 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `temp` is 1, `i` is 0, and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
