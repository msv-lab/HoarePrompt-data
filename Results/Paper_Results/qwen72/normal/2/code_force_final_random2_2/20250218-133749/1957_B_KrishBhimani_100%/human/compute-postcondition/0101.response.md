The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given context, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. The function is expected to handle `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function's goal is to generate and return a list of `n` non-negative integers for each test case such that their sum equals `k`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case is defined by two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a list of `n` non-negative integers for each test case such that their sum equals `k`.**
