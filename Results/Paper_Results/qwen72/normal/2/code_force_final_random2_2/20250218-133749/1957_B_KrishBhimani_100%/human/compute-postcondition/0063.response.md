The code snippet `ans.append(k - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` initially contains the value `(1 << i) - 1`.
- `sum(ans)` calculates the sum of the elements in `ans`.
- `k - sum(ans)` computes the difference between `k` and the sum of the elements in `ans`.
- This result is appended to `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `l1` is a list of strings from the input.
- If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `ans` is a list containing the value `(1 << i) - 1`.
- `k0` is now equal to `k`.
- `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
- `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`.

After executing the code:
- `ans` now contains two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`, `ans` is a list containing the values `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.**
