Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the input string provided by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string and `a` is not modified.***
