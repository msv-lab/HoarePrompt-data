Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters, either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'TRIANGLE'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'SQUARE'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', then `a` remains 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is exactly 1, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` has more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string. If no input string `s` has exactly one '1', `a` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string provided by the user. If any input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If any input string `s` contains more than one '1' character, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 0. If no input string `s` contains more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string. After the if-else block, if `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it indicates that at least one input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character. If `a` is 0, it indicates that no input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
