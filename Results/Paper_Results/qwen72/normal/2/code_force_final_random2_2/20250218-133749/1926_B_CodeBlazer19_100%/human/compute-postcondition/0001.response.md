To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

- `t` is the input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This means `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
