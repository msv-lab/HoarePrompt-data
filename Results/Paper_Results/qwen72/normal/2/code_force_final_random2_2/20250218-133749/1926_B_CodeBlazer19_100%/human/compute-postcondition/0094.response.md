Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string provided by the user. If any input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If any input string `s` contains more than one '1' character, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 0. If no input string `s` contains more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` is 0 because all test cases have been processed. The loop index `i` is equal to `t-1`, which is -1 since `t` is now 0. The variable `n` holds the value of the last input integer representing the size of the grid for the last test case. The variable `j` is `n-1`, indicating the last row of the grid was processed. The variable `s` holds the last input string from the user, which represents the last row of the grid. The variables `a` and `b` will be set based on the conditions within the loop: `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any row contained exactly one '1', and `b` will be 'SQUARE' if any row contained more than one '1'. If no row contained exactly one '1', `a` remains 0, and if no row contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.
