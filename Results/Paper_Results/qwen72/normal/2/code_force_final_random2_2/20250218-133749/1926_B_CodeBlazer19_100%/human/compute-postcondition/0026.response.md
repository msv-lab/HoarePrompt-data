Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 0.
- The variable `n` retains its initial value, which is the input integer.
- The variable `j` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has run `n` times.
- The variable `a` will be either 0 (if no input string had exactly one '1') or 'TRIANGLE' (if any input string had exactly one '1').
- The variable `b` will be either an empty string (if no input string had more than one '1') or 'SQUARE' (if any input string had more than one '1').
