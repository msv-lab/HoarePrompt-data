Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `a` is the string 'TRIANGLE'.
- `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a)
```

This statement will print the value of the variable `a`.

Given that `a` is explicitly defined as 'TRIANGLE', the output will be:

Output: **TRIANGLE**
