Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0000
0100
0010
0001
```

This input represents a triangle with `k=4` (an upside-down triangle). According to the problem description, the output should be "TRIANGLE". However, the program will incorrectly output "SQUARE" because it only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if it's a triangle, and if a row contains more than one '1', it assumes it's a square. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the structure of the triangle or square, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
