### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads each row of the grid as a string.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row, it counts the number of '1's in the row using `s.count('1')`.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not zero (i.e., a triangle was detected), it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Triangle Detection**: The function only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if it is part of a triangle. This is insufficient because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, but they must be arranged in a specific pattern (e.g., 1, 3, 5, etc.). The current logic will incorrectly identify any row with exactly one '1' as a triangle, even if it is part of a square.
- **Incorrect Square Detection**: The function assumes that if any row has more than one '1', it must be part of a square. This is also incorrect because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, and the function does not check the pattern of these '1's.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    000
    011
    011
    ```
  - The function will set `b` to 'SQUARE' because the second and third rows each have more than one '1'. This is correct.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    0000
    0000
    0100
    1110
    ```
  - The function will set `a` to 'TRIANGLE' because the third row has exactly one '1'. This is incorrect because the shape is actually a triangle with the pattern `1, 3`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    11
    11
    ```
  - The function will set `b` to 'SQUARE' because both rows have more than one '1'. This is correct.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    00111
    00010
    00000
    00000
    00000
    ```
  - The function will set `a` to 'TRIANGLE' because the second row has exactly one '1'. This is incorrect because the shape is actually a triangle with the pattern `1, 3, 5`.

- **Test Case 5**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    0000000000
    0000000000
    0000000000
    0000000000
    0000000000
    1111111110
    0111111100
    0011111000
    0001110000
    0000100000
    ```
  - The function will set `a` to 'TRIANGLE' because the sixth row has exactly one '1'. This is incorrect because the shape is actually a triangle with the pattern `1, 3, 5, 7, 9`.

- **Test Case 6**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    111
    111
    111
    ```
  - The function will set `b` to 'SQUARE' because all rows have more than one '1'. This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly detect the shapes based on the problem description. It fails to account for the specific patterns required for triangles and squares.

### Correctness:
**False**
