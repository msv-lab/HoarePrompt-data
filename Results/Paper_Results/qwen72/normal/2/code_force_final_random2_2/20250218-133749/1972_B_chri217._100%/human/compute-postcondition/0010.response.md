The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t ≤ 99. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t ≤ 98 (since it was decremented by 1).

The other variables (`cases`, `n`, `s`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not change.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t ≤ 98, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(n, s)` and the second tuple is also `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the stripped input string.**
