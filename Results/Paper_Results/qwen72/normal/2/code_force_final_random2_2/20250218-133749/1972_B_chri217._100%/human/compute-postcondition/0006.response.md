The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than 0. The placeholder `_` does not hold any specific value but is used to iterate over the range defined by `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t ≤ 99, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**
