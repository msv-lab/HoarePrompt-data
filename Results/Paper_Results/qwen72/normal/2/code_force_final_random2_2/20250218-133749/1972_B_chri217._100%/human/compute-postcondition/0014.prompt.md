Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `cases` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    cases.append((n, s))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string read from standard input (stdin) and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t ≤ 99, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(n, s)` and the second tuple is also `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the stripped input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t ≤ 98, `cases` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is `(n, s_old)`, the second tuple is `(n, s_old)`, and the third tuple is `(n, s)`, `n` is the integer value of the next line read from standard input, `s` is the new stripped input string, `s_old` is the previous stripped input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
