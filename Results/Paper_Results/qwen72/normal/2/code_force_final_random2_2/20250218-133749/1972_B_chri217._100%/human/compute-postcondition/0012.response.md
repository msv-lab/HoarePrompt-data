Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 98, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(n, s_old)` and the second tuple is also `(n, s_old)`, `n` is the integer value of the next line read from standard input, `s` is the new stripped input string, `s_old` is the previous stripped input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()` reads a new line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace, updating the value of `s`.
- The previous value of `s` (before the update) is referred to as `s_old`.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The list `cases` still contains two tuples, but the `s` in each tuple now refers to the old value of `s` before the update.
