#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'U' and 'D'.

    return cases
    #The program returns an empty list `cases` because `t` is 0, indicating there are no tuples in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from standard input a number `t` representing the count of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of inputs where each pair consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`. It returns a list of these pairs as tuples. If `t` is 0, it returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a tuple where the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down).
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters (`ups`) in the string `s` is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a tuple `case` where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the second element is a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`. If the count of "U" characters is even, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
