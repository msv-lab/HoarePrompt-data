Output State: **`case` is a tuple where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down). `ups` is the number of "U" characters in `s`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ups` is calculated as the sum of 1 for each character `c` in the string `s` (which is the second element of the tuple `case`) that is equal to "U".
- The value of `ups` is now the count of "U" characters in the string `s`.
- The initial state of `case` remains unchanged.
