Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 3, `s` is a list containing the first three characters of `sChar`, `i` is the third character of `sChar`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the third character of `sChar` (stored in `i`) to the list `s`, which initially contained the first two characters of `sChar`. After the execution, `s` now contains the first three characters of `sChar`. The value of `i` remains the same, as it was used to append to `s`.
