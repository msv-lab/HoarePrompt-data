Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now the smallest index such that `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s) - 1`, and `s[left]` must be '0'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `left` is incremented by 1.
- Since `left` was initially an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s) - 1`, after incrementing `left` by 1, it still satisfies `left <= right` and `left < len(s) - 1`.
- The condition `s[left + 1]` must be '0' is no longer directly applicable because `left` has been incremented, but now `s[left]` must be '0'.
- All other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `right`, `i`) remain unchanged.
