Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it handles the sorting of the binary string. Specifically, the approach of swapping individual elements does not align with the problem's requirement of performing cyclic shifts on substrings. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Cyclic Shift Implementation**: The program attempts to swap individual elements (`s[right]` and `s[left]`) rather than performing a cyclic shift on a substring. This means the program is not following the specified operation of cyclically shifting a substring.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is based on the distance between `right` and `left`, but this does not accurately reflect the cost of a cyclic shift operation as defined in the problem statement.

3. **Handling of Substrings**: The program does not correctly handle the selection and cyclic shifting of substrings. It only swaps individual elements, which is not equivalent to a cyclic shift.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input string `101011`.

- **Expected Output**: The minimum cost to sort the string `101011` is 5.
  - One possible sequence of operations:
    1. Choose the substring `101011` and perform a cyclic shift: `101011 -> 110101`.
    2. Choose the substring `110101` and perform a cyclic shift: `110101 -> 111010`.
    3. Choose the substring `111010` and perform a cyclic shift: `111010 -> 111100`.
  - Total cost: 6 + 6 + 3 = 15 (but the optimal cost is 5).

- **Actual Output**: The program will not produce the correct output because it does not perform cyclic shifts correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
