Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order but with all '0's moved to the front and all '1's moved to the back, `cost` is the total number of swaps performed to achieve this arrangement, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is the index of the first '1' in the final `s` (or the length of `s` if no '1' is found), and `right` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to swap '0's and '1's until all '0's are moved to the front and all '1's are moved to the back of the list `s`.
- The variable `cost` accumulates the total number of swaps made during the process.
- The variable `left` ends up being the index of the first '1' in the final list `s`, or the length of `s` if there are no '1's.
- The variable `right` ends up being the length of `s` because the loop terminates when `right` is no longer less than the length of `s`.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is the last character of the original `sChar`.
- The variable `sChar` remains a binary string with the same length constraints, and `s` is a list representation of `sChar` after the loop has completed its operations.
