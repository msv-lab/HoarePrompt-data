Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly, which does not account for the requirement of performing cyclic shifts on substrings. Additionally, the algorithm does not consider the optimal way to minimize the total cost of sorting the string.

A correct approach would involve identifying the optimal substrings to cyclically shift to achieve the sorted order with the minimum cost. This typically involves finding the longest prefix that can be shifted to the end to achieve a sorted string, and then calculating the cost based on the length of the substring that needs to be shifted.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    # Find the position where the string breaks the sorted order
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1' and s[(i + 1) % n] == '0':
            break
    else:
        # If no break point is found, the string is already sorted
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the cost of the optimal cyclic shift
    cost = min(i + 1, n - i - 1)
    return cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
```

This function correctly identifies the point where the string breaks the sorted order and calculates the minimum cost to sort the string by performing a cyclic shift.
