To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `left`
- `right`
- `len(s)`

### Initial State:
- `left` is 0
- `right` is 1
- `len(s)` is the length of the list `s`, which is the same as the length of the binary string `sChar`.

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **`left <= right`**: 
   - `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, so this condition is already satisfied.

2. **`right < len(s)`**:
   - `right` is 1, and `len(s)` is the length of `sChar`, which is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
   - Since `len(s)` is at least 2, this condition is also satisfied.

3. **`left < len(s)`**:
   - `left` is 0, and `len(s)` is at least 2.
   - This condition is also satisfied.

Since all the conditions in the `while` loop are already satisfied with the given initial state, no adjustments are needed.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
