Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now `right + 1` and must be less than `len(s) - 2`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`, and `s[right + 2]` must not be '0'.**
