To ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head: `left < len(s) and s[left] != '1'`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from the original `right` position or the length of `s` if no '0' is found.
- `i` is the last character of `sChar`.
- `left` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '1' is found.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `left < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that `left` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
   - For the loop to execute, `left` must be less than the length of `s`.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left] != '1'`**
   - This condition ensures that the character at index `left` in `s` is not '1'.
   - For the loop to execute, the character at index `left` must be '0'.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`left` must be less than `len(s)`**: This is already satisfied if `left` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '1' is found. However, for the loop to execute, `left` must be less than `len(s)`.
- **`s[left]` must be '0'**: For the loop to execute, the character at index `left` must be '0'. If `left` is the index of the first '1', then `s[left]` is '1', and the loop will not execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `left` must be an index where `s[left]` is '0'. Since `left` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' or the length of `s` if no '1' is found, we need to adjust `left` to be the index of the first '0' in `s`.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from the original `right` position or the length of `s` if no '0' is found, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, and `left` is the index of the first occurrence of '0' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '0' is found.**
