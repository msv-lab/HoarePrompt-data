Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', count is a list of 7 zeros.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except that the `count` variable is now a list of 7 zeros.
