Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems. This part is handled correctly and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Counting Problems**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 to represent the counts of problems with difficulties 'A' to 'G'. It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` based on the character's position in the alphabet. This is done using `ord(char) - ord('A')`, which correctly maps 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, and so on. This part is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. It checks if the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m` and, if so, adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`. This logic is correct because it ensures that each difficulty level appears at least `m` times in the final set of problems.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case. This is done correctly within the loop that processes each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there are no problems of a certain difficulty level or when the number of problems is exactly enough for the required rounds. For example, if `a` contains no 'A' and `m` is 1, the program will correctly determine that one 'A' problem is needed.

6. **Correctness Check**: The logic implemented in the program matches the problem description and the example provided. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to hold `m` rounds.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
