Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It counts the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string `a`. For each difficulty level, it calculates how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement of `m` problems per difficulty level across `m` rounds. The total number of additional problems needed is then returned. This approach ensures that the minimum number of new problems is calculated accurately for each test case. No edge cases or logical errors have been identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input.
