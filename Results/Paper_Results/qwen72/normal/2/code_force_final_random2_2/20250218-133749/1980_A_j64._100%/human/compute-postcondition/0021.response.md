The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `a`, which contains characters from 'A' to 'G'. `m` is an integer representing the minimum number of times each character from 'A' to 'G' should appear in the string `a`. The function returns the number of additional problems (`needed_problems`) required to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `a`, where `n` is the length of the string `a` (containing characters from 'A' to 'G'), and `m` is the minimum number of times each character should appear in `a`. It returns the number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`.**
