Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a new input string.
- `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`.
- If `s` equals `s2`, then `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string. Otherwise, `s2` remains a shuffled version of `s`.

Given the `print` statement:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **Yes**
