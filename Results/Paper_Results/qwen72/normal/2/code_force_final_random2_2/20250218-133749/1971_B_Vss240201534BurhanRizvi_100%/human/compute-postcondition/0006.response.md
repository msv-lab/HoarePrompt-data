Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- The length of `s` is greater than 1.
- All characters in `s` are the same.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

Since the conditions do not affect the content of the `print` statement, the output will always be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
