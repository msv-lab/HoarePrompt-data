Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), `int(input())` must be greater than 0, the length of `s` is greater than 1, the set of characters in `s` is not all the same, or the length of `s` is 1, `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`. Additionally, `s` is equal to `s2`.**
