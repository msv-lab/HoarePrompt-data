Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of up to 10 lowercase English letters. If the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, the function prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s`. If the shuffled version matches the original string, it prints a shifted version of `s` (the last character moved to the front). The function processes `t` test cases and prints the results for each. **
