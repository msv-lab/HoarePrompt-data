Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `m`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m, each calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = m`. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `m`.
- The variable `dp` is updated in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, `dp[i]` is set to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `num`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The final state of `dp` will have all elements from `dp[3]` to `dp[m]` calculated according to the given formula.
