The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a chessboard size `n` and a number of moves `k`. For each test case, it reads `k` pairs of coordinates `(r, c)` representing moves on the chessboard. It calculates a value `num` based on these moves: adding 1 for each move where `r` equals `c`, and 2 otherwise. It then computes `m` as `n - num`. Depending on the value of `m`, the function either prints 0 if `m` is 0, prints 1 if `m` is 1, or computes and prints a dynamic programming result for `m` greater than 1. The dynamic programming result is calculated using a specific recurrence relation and modulo operation. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0.
