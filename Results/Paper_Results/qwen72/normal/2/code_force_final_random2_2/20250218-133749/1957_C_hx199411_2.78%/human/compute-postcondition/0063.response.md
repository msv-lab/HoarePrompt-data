Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n`. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 3. Otherwise, if the condition is checked in the if part, `num` is 4, and if the condition is checked in the else part, `num` is 5 or 6.***
