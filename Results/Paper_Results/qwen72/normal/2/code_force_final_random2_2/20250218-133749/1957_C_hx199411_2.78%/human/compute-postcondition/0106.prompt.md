Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if c == r:
        num += 1
    else:
        num += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is set to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are the new integers provided by the user input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is set to 2. Otherwise, `num` is set to 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are the new integers provided by the user input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
