Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is `k-1`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**. 

Explanation: The value of `dp[i]` is updated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
