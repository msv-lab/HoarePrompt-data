Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `dp[2] = 3` updates the second element of the list `dp` to be 3. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The list `dp` now has its first element (`dp[1]`) set to 1 and its second element (`dp[2]`) set to 3, while all other elements remain 0.
