Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5. `num` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if c == r:
        num += 1
    else:
        num += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers from user input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is set to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
