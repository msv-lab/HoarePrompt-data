Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop. For each move where `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1, and for each move where `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is incremented by 2.**
