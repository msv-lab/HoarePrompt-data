Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n - num`, where `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1. `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, and `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
