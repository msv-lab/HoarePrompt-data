Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 5, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[4]` which is `(dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[5]` which is `(dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `dp[i]` where `i` is 5.
- The new value of `dp[5]` is calculated as `(dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
