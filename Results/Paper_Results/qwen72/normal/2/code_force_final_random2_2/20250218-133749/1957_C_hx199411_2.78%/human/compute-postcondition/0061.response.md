The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num` depends on the conditions given in the initial state:

- If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` was initially 2.
- If `c` is not equal to `r` and the condition is checked in the if part, `num` was initially 3.
- If `c` is not equal to `r` and the condition is checked in the else part, `num` was initially 4.

Therefore, the new values of `num` will be:

- If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` becomes 3.
- If `c` is not equal to `r` and the condition is checked in the if part, `num` becomes 4.
- If `c` is not equal to `r` and the condition is checked in the else part, `num` becomes 5.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n`. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 3. Otherwise, `num` is 4 if the condition is checked in the if part, and `num` is 5 if the condition is checked in the else part.**
