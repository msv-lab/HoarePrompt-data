Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 3, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is now `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `dp[i]` where `i` is 3.
- The new value of `dp[3]` is calculated as `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Substituting the known values: `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, and `i` is 3.
- Therefore, `dp[3]` becomes `(3 + (3 - 1) * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which simplifies to `(3 + 2 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, and further to `(3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is `7 % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, resulting in `7`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
