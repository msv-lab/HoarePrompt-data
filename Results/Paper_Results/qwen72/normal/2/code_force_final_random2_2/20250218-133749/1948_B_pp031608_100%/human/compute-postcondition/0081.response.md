Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.** 

The value of `ans` has been updated to False, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
