The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to the first element of the list `nums`. Let's break down the impact:

- `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.
- The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `nums`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is `m - 3`.
- `nums` is a list formed by converting `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` to it.
- If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

After executing the code:
- `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list formed by converting `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` to it, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `ans` remains True.**
