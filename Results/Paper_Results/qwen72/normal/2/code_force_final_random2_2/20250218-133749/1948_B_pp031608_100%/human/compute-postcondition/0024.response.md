Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 3, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` is `False`, `nums` is undefined or unchanged if it was previously defined, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
