Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the transformation of elements into their constituent digits and then checking if the array can be sorted. Specifically, the logic inside the loop that checks if the array can be transformed into a sorted array is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Transformation Handling**: The code attempts to transform only the `i-1` element when it finds an out-of-order pair. However, the transformation should be applied to any element that is at least 10, and the resulting digits should be inserted back into the array in the correct positions.

2. **Incorrect Check for Sorted Array**: The code checks if the digits of the `i-1` element plus the `i` element are sorted, but this is not sufficient. It needs to check if the entire array can be transformed into a sorted array after applying the operation any number of times.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    def split_number(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    
    stack = []
    for num in arr:
        if num >= 10:
            digits = split_number(num)
            for digit in reversed(digits):
                stack.append(digit)
        else:
            stack.append(num)
        
        while len(stack) > 1 and stack[-1] < stack[-2]:
            return False
    
    return True

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_be_sorted(arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version uses a stack to handle the transformation of elements into their digits and ensures that the array can be checked for being sorted correctly.
