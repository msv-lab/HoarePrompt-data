Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and the list `nums` remained sorted throughout all iterations. If at any point `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to 1, so after all iterations, `i` will be 1.
- The variable `ans` will be True if the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` was never met or if it was met but the list `nums` remained sorted. If the condition was met and `nums` was not sorted, `ans` will be False.
- The list `arr` may have been modified during the loop, specifically where `arr[i - 1]` was updated to `nums[0]` if the condition was met and `nums` was sorted.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
