### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted initially.

3. **Backward Iteration**:
   - The function iterates through the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`). This is a good approach because it allows the function to handle the most significant elements first, which is crucial for ensuring the array can be sorted.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - For each pair of adjacent elements `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. If so, it means the array is not sorted at this point.

5. **Digit Splitting**:
   - If the condition is met, it splits the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits. It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - However, there is a subtle issue here. The function only checks if the list of digits combined with `arr[i]` is sorted, but it does not ensure that the entire array can be sorted after performing the operation. Specifically, the function should check if the entire array can be sorted after the operation, not just the local segment.

6. **Update Array**:
   - If the digits are sorted, it updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split list. This step is correct in terms of updating the array, but it does not guarantee that the entire array will be sorted.

7. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise `NO`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic correctly identifies when the array cannot be sorted by splitting elements into their digits in some cases, but it fails to ensure that the entire array can be sorted after the operation.
  - The function should check the entire array after each operation to ensure it is sorted, not just the local segment.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases such as arrays that are already sorted or contain only single-digit numbers.
  - However, it may fail in cases where the array can be sorted by multiple operations, and the function only checks the immediate effect of the operation.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The function has a time complexity of \(O(n \times d)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(d\) is the maximum number of digits in any element. This is efficient enough given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound in many cases but fails to ensure that the entire array can be sorted after performing the operation. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
