Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to `False`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ans` was initially `True` unless conditions within the loop body caused it to change, but now it is explicitly set to `False`.
