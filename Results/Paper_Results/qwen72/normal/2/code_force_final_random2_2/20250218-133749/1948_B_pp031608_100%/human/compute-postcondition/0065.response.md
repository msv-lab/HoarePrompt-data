The code snippet `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` constructs a new list `nums` by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string, iterating over each character of this string, converting each character back to an integer, and then appending the integer `arr[i]` to the resulting list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is True
- The current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`

Let's assume:
- `arr[i - 1]` is some integer, say `X`
- `arr[i]` is some integer, say `Y`, and `Y < X`

The code will:
1. Convert `X` to a string.
2. Iterate over each character in the string representation of `X`, convert each character back to an integer, and create a list of these integers.
3. Append `Y` to this list.

For example, if `arr[i - 1]` is 123 and `arr[i]` is 10, the resulting `nums` would be `[1, 2, 3, 10]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
