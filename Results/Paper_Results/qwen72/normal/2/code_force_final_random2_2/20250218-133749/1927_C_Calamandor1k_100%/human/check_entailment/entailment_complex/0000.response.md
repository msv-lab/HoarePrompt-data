Reasoning:

The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case, collecting the necessary data (n, m, k, a, b) into a list called `cases`. This part of the program is correctly implemented and adheres to the input format specified in the problem description.

The function `func_1` is designed to process each test case and determine whether it is possible to select \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each of the arrays `a` and `b` such that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are included. The function performs the following steps for each test case:

1. **Identify Unique Elements**: It creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
2. **Filter Relevant Elements**: It filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to \(k\), resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
3. **Determine Exclusive and Common Elements**: It calculates the elements that are exclusive to `a` (`only_a`), exclusive to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
4. **Check Conditions**:
   - If the number of elements in `only_a` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\), it is impossible to select the required elements, so the function appends 'NO' to the results.
   - Similarly, if the number of elements in `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\), the function appends 'NO'.
   - If the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than \(k\), it is also impossible to select the required elements, so the function appends 'NO'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function appends 'YES'.

The logic in the function `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the required checks. The final step of printing the results is also correctly implemented, ensuring that the output matches the expected format.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
