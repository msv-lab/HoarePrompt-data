The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from the tuple in `cases`, and the list `cases` itself. The loop can execute again if there is another tuple in `cases` to process.

At the end of the last iteration, `cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, and the next tuple in `cases` is `(n, m, k, a, b)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cases` must have at least two tuples, and the next tuple to be processed should be the second tuple in the list.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the next tuple in `cases` is now the second tuple in the list, and `cases` must have at least two tuples.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, the next tuple in `cases` is the second tuple, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES', 'YES'. If `len(only_a) > k // 2`, `results` also contains the string 'NO'. `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `total_distinct < k`, all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code outside the loop. If `len(only_b) > k // 2`, the program continues to the next line of code, and all variables remain unchanged.**
