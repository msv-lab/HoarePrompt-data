Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, but the program continues to the next line of code.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same. The only change is that the program's control flow moves to the next iteration of the loop, assuming the code is within a loop. If the code is not within a loop, the `continue` statement would typically cause an error, but since the context suggests it is part of a loop, the program simply proceeds to the next iteration.
