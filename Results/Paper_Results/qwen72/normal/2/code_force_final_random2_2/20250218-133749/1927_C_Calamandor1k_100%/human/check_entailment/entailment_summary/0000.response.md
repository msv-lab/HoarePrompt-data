Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the input for each test case, storing them in a list called `cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: The function `func_1` processes each test case by:
   - Converting the lists `a` and `b` into sets of unique elements.
   - Filtering these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - Calculating the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - It checks if the number of elements unique to `a` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of elements unique to `b` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - It then checks if the total number of distinct elements (unique to `a`, unique to `b`, and common) is less than `k`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If none of the above conditions are violated, it appends 'YES' to the results.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case.

The logic ensures that the program correctly determines whether it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included. The conditions checked in the program align with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
