t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each element in cases is a tuple containing three elements: n, m, and k, where n and m are positive integers representing the lengths of arrays a and b respectively, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 * min(n, m). Additionally, each test case includes two lists, a and b, of lengths n and m respectively, where each element in a and b is an integer in the range [1, 10^6].
