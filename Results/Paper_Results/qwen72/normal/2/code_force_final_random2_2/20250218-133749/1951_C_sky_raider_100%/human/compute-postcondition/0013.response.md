Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t)`, `t` is `t + s`, `k` is `k - s`**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 1.
- `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1.
- `s` is now the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t)`.
- `t` is updated to `t + s`.
- `k` is updated to `k - s`.
