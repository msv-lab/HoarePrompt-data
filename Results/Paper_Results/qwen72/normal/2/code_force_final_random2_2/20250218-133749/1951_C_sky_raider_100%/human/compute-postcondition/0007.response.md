The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, which is correct for the loop to begin.

Given that `n` is already stated as a positive integer, this condition ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the provided state.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
