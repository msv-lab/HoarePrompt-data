The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation overwrites the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` with new values provided by the user.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` remains a positive integer
- `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` (but may be 0 if `k` has been fully decremented)
- `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + ... + s * (l[n-1] + t)`
- `t` is `t + n * s`
- `k` is `k - (n-1) * s`
- The input value for the range must be greater than `n`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned to new values provided by the user.
- The values of `i`, `s`, `c`, `t`, and the condition for the range input remain unchanged, but they now depend on the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`i` is `n` (where `n` is the new value provided by the user), `n` is a positive integer (new value provided by the user), `m` is an integer (new value provided by the user), `k` is an integer (new value provided by the user), `s` is the minimum value between the new `m` and `k` (but may be 0 if `k` has been fully decremented), `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + ... + s * (l[n-1] + t)` (using the new `n`), `t` is `t + n * s` (using the new `n`), and `k` is `k - (n-1) * s` (using the new `n`), and the input value for the range must be greater than the new `n`.**
