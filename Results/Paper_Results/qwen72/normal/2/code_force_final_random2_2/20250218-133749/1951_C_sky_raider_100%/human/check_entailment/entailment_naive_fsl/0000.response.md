Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting Prices**: The prices per ticket for each day are sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the cheapest tickets are purchased first, which is a key strategy to minimize the total cost.
3. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program iterates through the sorted list of prices, purchasing the maximum number of tickets possible each day (up to `m` tickets or until `k` tickets are purchased). It keeps track of the total cost and updates the number of tickets purchased and the remaining tickets to be purchased.
4. **Price Increase**: The program correctly accounts for the price increase after purchasing tickets on a given day by adding the number of tickets purchased to the price of subsequent days.

The program handles edge cases such as:
- When `k` is less than or equal to `m`, it can purchase all tickets in one day.
- When `k` is greater than `m`, it spreads the purchases over multiple days, ensuring the minimum cost.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
