Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer provided by the user, `k` is `k - s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`, `t` is `2 * s + s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is updated to the minimum of `m` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + s`. Since `t` was initially `2 * s`, after the update, `t` becomes `2 * s + s`, which simplifies to `3 * s`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `c`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
