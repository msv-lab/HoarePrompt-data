The value of `t` is incremented by `s`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `c`, `k`) remain unchanged. Since `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, and `t` was previously updated to `t + s`, the new value of `t` is now `t + s + s` or `t + 2 * s`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t)`, `t` is `t + 2 * s`, `k` is `k - s`.**
