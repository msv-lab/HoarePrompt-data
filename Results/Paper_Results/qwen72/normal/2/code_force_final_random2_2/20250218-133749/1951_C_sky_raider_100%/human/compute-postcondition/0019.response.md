Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`, `t` is `t + 2 * s`, `k` is `k - s`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer greater than 2.
- The value of `s` remains the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- The value of `c` is updated to include the additional term `s * (l[2] + t)`, making the new value of `c` equal to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`.
- The value of `t` remains `t + 2 * s`.
- The value of `k` remains `k - s`.
