Output State: **`i` is `n` (where `n` is the new value provided by the user), `n` is a positive integer (new value provided by the user), `m` is an integer (new value provided by the user), `k` is an integer (new value provided by the user), `s` is the minimum value between the new `m` and `k` (but may be 0 if `k` has been fully decremented), `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + ... + s * (l[n-1] + t)` (using the new `n`), `t` is `t + n * s` (using the new `n`), `k` is `k - (n-1) * s` (using the new `n`), and `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`.
- The initial state variables `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged except for the addition of the list `l` which now contains the integers provided by the user.
