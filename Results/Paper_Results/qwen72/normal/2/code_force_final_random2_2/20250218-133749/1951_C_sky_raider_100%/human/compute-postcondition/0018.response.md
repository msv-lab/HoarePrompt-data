Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t)`, `t` is `t + 2 * s`, `k` is `k - s`**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- The value of `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t)`.
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + 2 * s`.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - s`.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
