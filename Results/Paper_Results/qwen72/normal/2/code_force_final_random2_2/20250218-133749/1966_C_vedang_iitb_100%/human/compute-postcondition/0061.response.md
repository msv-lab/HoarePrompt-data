Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the sorted list `a`.
- For each element `sz`, if `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, `mexsize` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
