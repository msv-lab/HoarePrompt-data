The only object in the loop head is the variable `sz`, which iterates over the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a` is not empty. Since `a` is described as a sorted list of integers, it must contain at least one integer for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`**
