Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `sz` is the first element in the list `a`. If `sz` (the first element of `a`) is equal to `mexsize` (which is 1), then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.***
