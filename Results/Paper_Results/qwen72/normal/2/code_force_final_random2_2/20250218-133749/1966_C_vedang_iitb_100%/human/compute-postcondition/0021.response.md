To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `tc` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not present in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mexsize`**:
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` is the smallest integer greater than 0 that is missing from the list.
   - Given that `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` is a positive integer within the range of the list `a`.

2. **Condition in the Print Statement**:
   - The condition `mexsize % 2 == 1` checks if `mexsize` is an odd number.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, the statement will print 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is even, the statement will print 'Bob'.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `mexsize` is determined by the list `a` and is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
- Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in the list, it can either be odd or even.
- The print statement will output 'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, and 'Bob' if `mexsize` is even.

### Final Output:
Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
