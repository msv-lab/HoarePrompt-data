### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to remove a certain number of stones `k` from each non-empty pile.
   - The key observation is that the game is a variant of the Nim game where the number of stones removed is the same across all non-empty piles.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when all piles are empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy in such games often involves the concept of the "mex" (minimum excludant), which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set of pile sizes.
   - In this specific game, the mex value helps determine the winning strategy because it indicates the smallest number of stones that can be removed without leaving any pile with a size equal to the mex.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `a`.
   - It calculates the maximum pile size `maxsize` and sorts the pile sizes.
   - It then iterates through the sorted pile sizes to find the mex value.
   - Finally, it determines the winner based on whether the mex value is greater than the maximum pile size and whether the mex value is even or odd.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the mex value by iterating through the sorted pile sizes.
   - The logic to determine the winner based on the mex value and the maximum pile size is correct.
   - The condition `if mexsize > maxsize` is used to check if the mex value is greater than the maximum pile size, which is a valid approach.
   - The final decision to print "Alice" or "Bob" based on the parity of the mex value is also correct.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the first test case with piles `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the mex value is 1 (since 1 is not in the list). Since 1 is less than the maximum size 3 and 1 is odd, the program correctly prints "Alice".
   - For the second test case with piles `[1, 7]`, the mex value is 2 (since 2 is not in the list). Since 2 is less than the maximum size 7 and 2 is even, the program correctly prints "Bob".
   - For the third test case with piles `[1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`, the mex value is 5 (since 5 is not in the list). Since 5 is less than the maximum size 100 and 5 is odd, the program correctly prints "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final: **True**
