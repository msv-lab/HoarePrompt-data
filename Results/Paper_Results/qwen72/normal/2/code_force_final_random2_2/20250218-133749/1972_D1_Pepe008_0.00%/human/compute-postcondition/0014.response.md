Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `x` is \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\). Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.**
