Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is `T-1`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b` if \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), otherwise `x` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`T`**: This is the total number of iterations the loop will execute. After all iterations, `T` remains the same.
- **`t`**: This is the loop counter. After all iterations, `t` will be `T-1` because the loop starts with `t = 0` and increments `t` until it reaches `T-1`.
- **`info`**: This is updated in each iteration based on the input provided. After all iterations, `info` will be the last input read.
- **`a` and `b`**: These are derived from the last `info` and must be valid integers.
- **`i`**: This is the loop variable inside the inner loop, which iterates from 1 to `b`. After the loop completes, `i` will be `b`.
- **`suma`**: This is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop, where each `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b` if \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\). The final value of `suma` is the sum of these values minus 1, as per the code.
