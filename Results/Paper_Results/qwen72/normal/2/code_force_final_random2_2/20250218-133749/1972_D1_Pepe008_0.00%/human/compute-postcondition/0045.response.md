Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `suma = 0` sets the variable `suma` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
