To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

Given for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `T` is greater than 1
- `t` is 2
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1
- `i` is `b`
- `suma` is 0

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `b`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, b + 1)` is non-empty. This means `b` must be at least 1.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `b` in the initial state, but within the loop, `i` will start from 1 and go up to `b`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`b`**: Since the loop condition depends on `b`, `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- **`i`**: The loop will initialize `i` to 1, so we need to adjust the initial state to reflect this.

### Final State:
- `n` and `m` remain as positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `T` remains greater than 1
- `t` remains 2
- `info` remains a list of strings obtained from the input
- `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` must be at least 1
- `i` is 1 (since the loop will start with `i` being 1)
- `suma` remains 0

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is 0**
