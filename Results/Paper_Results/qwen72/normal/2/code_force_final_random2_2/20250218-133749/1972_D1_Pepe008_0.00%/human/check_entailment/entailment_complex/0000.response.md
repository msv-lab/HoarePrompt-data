Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of `b` and calculating a value `x` based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to calculate `x` does not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) does not capture the required condition.

2. **Off-by-One Error**: The final result is printed as `suma - 1`, which seems arbitrary and not justified by the problem statement.

3. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The inner loop iterates over `j` from 4 to `b+1`, but the problem requires checking all pairs `(a, b)` where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).

4. **Missing GCD Calculation**: The program does not use the greatest common divisor (GCD) in the main calculation, which is crucial for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
