Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop, where each `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b` if \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\), otherwise `x` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from \(i = 1\) to \(i = b\).
- For each iteration, `x` is calculated as \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- If \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\), then `x` is added to `suma`.
- After all iterations, `suma` contains the sum of all valid `x` values.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
