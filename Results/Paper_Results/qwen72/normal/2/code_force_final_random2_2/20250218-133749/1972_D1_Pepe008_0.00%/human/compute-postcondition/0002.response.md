The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on spaces, and stores these parts in the list `info`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `T`, or `t`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
