Output State: **`k` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\), `t`, `tc`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `i` until \(1 << (i + 1)\) exceeds `k`.
- When the loop terminates, `i` will be the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\).
- The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, and `ans` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged from their initial values.
