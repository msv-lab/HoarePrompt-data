#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        i = 0
        
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        
        print(len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the values of the last test case input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `ans` is a list containing the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i`. The loop has printed the length of `ans` and the elements of `ans` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a list `ans` that contains specific values derived from `k` and all powers of 2 up to \(2^{19}\) except one. It then prints the length of this list followed by its elements. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes `t` remaining as the initial input, `tc` being `t-1`, `n` and `k` holding the values of the last test case, and `i` being the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\).
