The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`.

- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `k` is assigned the second integer from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `i`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `ans` contains the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i`.**
