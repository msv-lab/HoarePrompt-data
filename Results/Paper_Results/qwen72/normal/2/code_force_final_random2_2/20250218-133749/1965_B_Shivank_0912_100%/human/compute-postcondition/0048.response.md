To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `tc` is set to 1.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `k` is unchanged.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\).

2. **Construction of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is constructed as follows:
     - First part: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`
     - Second part: All powers of 2 from 1 to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\).

3. **Calculating the Length of `ans`:**
   - **First Part:**
     - This part contains 3 elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - **Second Part:**
     - The powers of 2 from 1 to \(2^{19}\) are: \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots, 2^{19}\).
     - There are 20 such powers.
     - Since \(2^i\) is excluded, the number of elements in this part is \(20 - 1 = 19\).

4. **Total Length of `ans`:**
   - The total length of `ans` is the sum of the lengths of the two parts:
     - First part: 3 elements
     - Second part: 19 elements
   - Therefore, the total length is \(3 + 19 = 22\).

Based on this analysis, the `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the `ans` list, which is 22.

Output: **22**
