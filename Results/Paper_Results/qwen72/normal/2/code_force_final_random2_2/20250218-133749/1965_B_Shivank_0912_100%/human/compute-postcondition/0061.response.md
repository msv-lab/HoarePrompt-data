The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value `20`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if the range value is greater than 0, which in this case is fixed at 20. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once regardless of the initial values of `k`, `i`, `t`, `tc`, `n`, or `ans`.

However, since the task specifies that we should adjust the states of objects in the loop head to ensure the loop executes, we need to set `j` to 0, as it is the starting point for the loop variable.

State: **`k` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\), `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`, `j` is 0**
