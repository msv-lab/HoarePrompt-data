The code snippet `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 1, the value `1 << j` evaluates to `2` (since `1 << 1` is `2`). Therefore, the value `2` is appended to the list `ans`.

The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list containing the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. After appending `2` to `ans`, the list `ans` will contain the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]`.

All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\), `ans` is a list containing the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]`, and `j` is 1.**
