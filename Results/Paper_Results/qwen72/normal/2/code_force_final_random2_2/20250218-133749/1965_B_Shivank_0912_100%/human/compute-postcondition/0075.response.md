The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the description, it should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with each test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. The constraints are as follows: 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. However, the specific output or return value for each test case is not provided in the problem statement.

Given the lack of specific output details, the general functionality can be described as:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with each test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**
