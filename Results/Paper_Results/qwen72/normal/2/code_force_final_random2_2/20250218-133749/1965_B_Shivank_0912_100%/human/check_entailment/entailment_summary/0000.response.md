Reasoning:  
The program aims to generate a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions for each test case. The approach taken involves constructing a sequence that avoids having a subsequence sum equal to `k` while ensuring that every other value from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence of the sequence.

1. **Avoiding Subsequence Sum Equal to `k`:**
   - The program identifies the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` (denoted as `1 << i`).
   - It then constructs the sequence `ans` to include `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. This ensures that no combination of these values can sum up to `k`.
   - Additionally, it includes all powers of 2 up to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\). This helps in forming various sums without including `k`.

2. **Forming All Other Sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`):**
   - By including all powers of 2 up to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\), the program ensures that any sum from 1 to \(2^{20} - 1\) (which is much larger than `n` in the given constraints) can be formed.
   - The inclusion of `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` helps in covering the gaps around `k`.

3. **Constraints and Output:**
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed to have at most 25 elements, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The program correctly prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement and the constraints.
