The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range limit `20`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `20`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` remains 1, `n` remains an integer input by the user, `k` is unchanged, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\). If `j` equals `i`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]` and `j` is 2.**
