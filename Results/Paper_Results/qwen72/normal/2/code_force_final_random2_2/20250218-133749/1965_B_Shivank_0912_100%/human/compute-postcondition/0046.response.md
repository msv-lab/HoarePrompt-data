Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` remains 1, `n` remains an integer input by the user, `k` is unchanged, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\). If `j` is not equal to `i`, `j` is set to 2, and `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 1 << j]`. Otherwise, `j` remains `i`, and `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`.***
