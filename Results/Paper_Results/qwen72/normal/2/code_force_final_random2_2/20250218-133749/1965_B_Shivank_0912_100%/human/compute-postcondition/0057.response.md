To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State**: 
   - `k` is an integer input by the user (at least 2).
   - `i` is increased by 2.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `1 << (i + 1) <= k`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - We need to ensure that the condition `1 << (i + 1) <= k` holds true for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is increased by 2, we need to check if `1 << (i + 3) <= k` holds true.

4. **Current Values**:
   - Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`.
   - The condition for the next iteration would be `1 << (i_current + 3) <= k`.

5. **Adjustment**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be large enough to satisfy `1 << (i_current + 3) <= k`.
   - Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << (i_current + 3)`.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least `1 << (i + 3)`.

State: **`k` is an integer input by the user (at least 2), `i` is increased by 2, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << (i + 3)`**.
