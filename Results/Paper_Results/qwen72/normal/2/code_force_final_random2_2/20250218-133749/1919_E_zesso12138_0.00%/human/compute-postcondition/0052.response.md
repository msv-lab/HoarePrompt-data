Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers.**

Explanation:
- The variable `dp` is updated to the values of `new_dp`.
- All other variables (`n`, `p`, `offset`, `i`, `new_dp`) remain unchanged.
- The values of `dp` are now the same as those in `new_dp` after the updates based on the transitions defined in the loop.
