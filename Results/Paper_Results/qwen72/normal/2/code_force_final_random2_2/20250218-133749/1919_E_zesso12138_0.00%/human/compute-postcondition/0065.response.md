Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `j` is 1, `new_dp[2]` is `(dp[1] % MOD)`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` using the formula `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
- Given `j` is 1, `new_dp[2]` is updated to `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD`.
- Since `new_dp` is initially a list of zeros, `new_dp[2]` is 0.
- Therefore, `new_dp[2]` becomes `(0 + dp[1]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `dp[1] % MOD`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
