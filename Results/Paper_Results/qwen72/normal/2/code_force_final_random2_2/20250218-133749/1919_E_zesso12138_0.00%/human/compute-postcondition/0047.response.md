Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers where each element has been updated based on the transitions defined in the loop, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers, `j` is 4, and `2 * n + 1` must be greater than 4. If `j + 1` (which is 5) is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the value of `new_dp[5]` is updated to `(new_dp[5] + dp[4]) % MOD`.***
