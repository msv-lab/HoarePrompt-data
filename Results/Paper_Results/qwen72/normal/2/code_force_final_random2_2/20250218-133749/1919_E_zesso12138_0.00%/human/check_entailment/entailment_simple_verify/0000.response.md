Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The `func_1` function indeed uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the possible prefix sums at each step. The `dp` array is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1` to handle all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`. The `offset` variable is used to shift the range of possible prefix sums to non-negative indices, which is a common technique in dynamic programming problems involving negative indices.

2. **State Transition**: The state transition logic is correctly implemented. For each step `i` from 1 to `n`, the program updates the `new_dp` array by considering both possible transitions (adding 1 or subtracting 1) from the current state. This ensures that all possible prefix sums are accounted for at each step.

3. **Final Result Calculation**: After processing all elements, the program calculates the final prefix sum by adding the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p` to the `offset`. It then returns the corresponding value from the `dp` array. This is the correct way to determine the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sum array.

4. **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases. It parses the input data into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end. This ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases efficiently.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (n=1) and larger inputs (up to n=5000). It also correctly handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the modulo operation.

6. **Annotated Code Validation**: The annotations in the code accurately describe the state of the program at key points. They confirm that the dynamic programming table is correctly updated and that the final result is computed based on the correct prefix sum.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
