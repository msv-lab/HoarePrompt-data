The only objects in the loop head are the variable `res` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`, and `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration and must have at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least two elements, and `res` should be set to the next element in `results`.

State: **`t` remains a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`, `input` is still the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `1 + t + (t * n)`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration and must have at least two elements, `result` is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`, `res` is the second element of `results`**
