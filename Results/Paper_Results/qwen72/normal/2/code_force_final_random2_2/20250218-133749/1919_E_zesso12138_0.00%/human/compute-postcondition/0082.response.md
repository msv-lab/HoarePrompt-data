Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers representing sorted prefix sums. It computes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `2*n + 1` and updates it based on transitions defined in a loop. The function returns the value at the index `final_sum` in the `dp` array, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` plus `n`. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, `p` remains a list of `n` integers, and the `dp` array contains the results of the dynamic programming transitions. **
