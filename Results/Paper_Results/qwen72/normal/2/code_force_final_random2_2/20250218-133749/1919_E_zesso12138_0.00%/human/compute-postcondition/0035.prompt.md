Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`, `input` is still the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `1 + t + (t * n)`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `result` is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`.
Code of the loop:
for res in results:
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`, `input` is still the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `1 + t + (t * n)`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration and must have at least one element, `result` is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`, `res` is the first element of `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`, `input` is still the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `1 + t + (t * n)`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration and must have at least two elements, `result` is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`, `res` is the second element of `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`, `input` is still the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `1 + t + (t * n)`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration and must have at least three elements, `result` is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`, `res` is the third element of `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
