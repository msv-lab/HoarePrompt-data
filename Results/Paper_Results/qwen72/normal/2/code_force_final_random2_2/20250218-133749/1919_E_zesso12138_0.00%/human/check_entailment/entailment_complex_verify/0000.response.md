Reasoning: 

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The `func_1` function correctly initializes a `dp` array with a size of `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`. The `offset` variable is set to `n` to handle negative indices. This approach ensures that the program can track the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum.

2. **State Transition**: The state transition logic is correctly implemented. For each step `i` from 1 to `n`, the program updates the `new_dp` array by considering both possible transitions (adding 1 or subtracting 1) from the current state. This ensures that all possible prefix sums are accounted for.

3. **Final Result Calculation**: After processing all elements, the program calculates the final prefix sum by adding the last element of `p` to the `offset`. It then returns the corresponding value from the `dp` array. This correctly reflects the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

4. **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results for each test case. It uses the `sys.stdin.read` method to read all input at once and then parses it accordingly. This ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases efficiently.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (n=1) and larger inputs (up to n=5000). It also correctly handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the modulo operation.

6. **Consistency with Example**: The program's behavior matches the provided examples. For instance, it correctly identifies that there is no array `a` that can result in the sorted prefix sum array `[0]` and correctly counts the number of arrays `a` that can result in the sorted prefix sum array `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
