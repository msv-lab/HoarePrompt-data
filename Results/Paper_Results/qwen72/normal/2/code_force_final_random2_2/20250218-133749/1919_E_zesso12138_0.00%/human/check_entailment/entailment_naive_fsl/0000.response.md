Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The `func_1` function uses dynamic programming to keep track of the possible prefix sums at each step. The `dp` array is used to store the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum up to the current step. The `offset` variable is used to handle negative indices by shifting the range of possible prefix sums.

2. **State Transition**: The state transition in the dynamic programming approach is correctly implemented. For each element in the array, the program updates the `new_dp` array by considering both possible transitions (adding 1 or subtracting 1).

3. **Final Result Calculation**: After processing all elements, the program calculates the final prefix sum and returns the corresponding value from the `dp` array.

4. **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results for each test case. It uses the `sys.stdin.read` method to read all input at once and then parses it accordingly.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (n=1) and larger inputs (up to n=5000). It also correctly handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the modulo operation.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
