The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by the value of `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- The loop iterates `t` times.

At the start of the next iteration, the value of `t` does not change, and the loop variable `_` is incremented implicitly by the loop mechanism. However, since `_` is not used, its value is not relevant to the state of the program. The loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations has not reached `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for all variables except for the implicit increment of the loop variable `_`, which is not part of the state we need to track.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
