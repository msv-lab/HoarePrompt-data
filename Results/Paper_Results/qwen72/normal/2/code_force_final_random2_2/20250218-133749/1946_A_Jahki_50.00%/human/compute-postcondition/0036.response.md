To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`.
   - The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
   - `num` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `num2` is an input integer and is less than or equal to 10000.
   - `case` is an input string.
   - `op` is the number of times the loop has executed.
   - `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`.
   - `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd.
   - `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the loop started.
   - `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` and is greater than `median`.

2. **Context**:
   - The variable `op` is the number of times the loop has executed.
   - The loop is not explicitly shown, but it is implied that the loop modifies the list `b` in such a way that the median changes from `median` to `new_median`.

3. **Determination**:
   - Since `op` is the number of times the loop has executed, and the loop is designed to change the median from `median` to `new_median`, the value of `op` is the number of iterations required to achieve this change.

Given the information, the exact number of iterations (`op`) is not specified, but it is clear that `op` represents the number of times the loop has run to change the median.

Output: **op (where op is the number of times the loop has executed to change the median from median to new_median)**
