Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `op = 0` sets the variable `op` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies the ranges and conditions for these variables, which remain valid after the code execution.
