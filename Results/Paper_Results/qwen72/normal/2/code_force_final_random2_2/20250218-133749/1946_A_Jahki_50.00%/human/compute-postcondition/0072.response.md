Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num2 = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `num2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `num2` is determined by the user's input, but it is now an integer.
