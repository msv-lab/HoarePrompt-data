The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. If `num` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `num` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, `num` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be set to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
