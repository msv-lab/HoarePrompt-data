#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is 0, `i` is `num` (which is 0), `num2` is the last input integer, `case` is the last input string, `op` is the total number of operations performed across all iterations. If any `num2` was greater than 10000 during the iterations, the loop broke out early. Otherwise, for each valid `num2`, `a` was a list of integers extracted from the corresponding `case`, `b` was a sorted version of `a`, `ma` was set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` was even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` was odd, `median` was the element at index `ma` in `b` before the loop started, `new_median` was the element at index `ma` in `b` after the loop completed, and `b[ma]` was incremented until `new_median` became greater than `median`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, if `n` is greater than 10,000, the function prints `1` and `16668` and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list of integers by at least one. The function prints the number of operations for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends.
