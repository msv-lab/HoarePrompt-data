Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is the number of times the loop executed, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the loop started, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the loop has completed, `b[ma]` is now `b[ma] + op`.**

### Explanation:
- **`op`**: This variable keeps track of the number of times the loop has executed. After the loop completes, `op` will be equal to the number of iterations.
- **`b`**: The list `b` remains sorted throughout the loop. Each iteration increments the value at index `ma` by 1, and then the list is re-sorted.
- **`ma`**: This index is determined based on whether `num2` is even or odd. It remains constant throughout the loop.
- **`median`**: This is the value of `b[ma]` before the loop starts. It does not change during the loop.
- **`new_median`**: This is the value of `b[ma]` after the loop has completed. Since `b[ma]` is incremented by 1 each iteration, `new_median` will be `b[ma] + op` after the loop finishes.
- **`b[ma]`**: The value at index `ma` in the list `b` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. After the loop completes, `b[ma]` will be `b[ma] + op`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
