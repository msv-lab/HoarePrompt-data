To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. The variables involved in this condition are `new_median` and `median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5
- `num` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `num2` is an input integer and is less than or equal to 10000
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 2
- `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`
- `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the increment
- `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b`

For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must still be less than or equal to `median`. Since `median` is fixed (it is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the increment), the only way to ensure the loop continues is to ensure that `new_median` remains less than or equal to `median`.

However, since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine how `new_median` changes within the loop. Therefore, we must assume that `new_median` could change in such a way that it might no longer satisfy the condition `new_median <= median`.

Given this, the state should remain the same unless there is information indicating otherwise. Since we don't have information about how `new_median` changes, we will assume it remains valid for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the increment, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b`**.
