To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case`.
   - The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
   - `num` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `num2` is an input integer.
   - `case` is the new input string.
   - `op` is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`.
   - `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`.
   - `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before any iterations.
   - `new_median` is `median + op`.
   - `b[ma]` is now `median + op`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`.
   - `ma` is the index used to find the median of the list `b`.
   - `median` is the value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.
   - `new_median` is the value of `median` after `op` iterations, where `new_median = median + op`.
   - `op` is the number of iterations required to make `new_median` greater than `median`.

3. **Key Points:**
   - Since `new_median` is `median + op`, and `new_median` is greater than `median`, it implies that `op` must be a positive integer.
   - The value of `op` is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`.

Given these conditions, the `print(op)` statement will print the value of `op`, which is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`.

Output: **op (where op is the number of iterations it took for new_median to become greater than median)**
