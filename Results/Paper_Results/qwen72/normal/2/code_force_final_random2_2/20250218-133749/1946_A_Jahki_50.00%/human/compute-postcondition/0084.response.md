Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `b[ma]` to the variable `median`.
- The value of `ma` depends on whether `num2` is even or odd:
  - If `num2` is even, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.
  - If `num2` is odd, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`.
- The variable `median` is then set to the value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `b`) remain unchanged.
