Postcondition: **start and end are integers where start <= end, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders named with digits, some of these subfolders may contain .html files, t must be greater than 0, n is an input integer, s is the new input string, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is an even number, the condition is met. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is odd, or `cnt1` is 1, the condition is met. If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or is even, and '11' is in the new `s`, the string '11' is present in the new `s`; otherwise, '11' is not a substring of the new `s`. Regardless of the condition, t is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.**
