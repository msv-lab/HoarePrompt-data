To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed.
- The current directory contains subfolders named with digits, and some of these subfolders may contain `.html` files.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.

### Conditions:
1. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is an even number, the condition is met.
2. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is odd, or `cnt1` is 1, the condition is met.
3. If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or is even, and '11' is in `s`, the string '11' is present in `s`.
4. Otherwise, '11' is not a substring of `s`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the conditions or variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'YES'.
- The conditions provided are used to determine whether certain logic should be executed, but they do not affect the output of the `print('YES')` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES', regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`.

Output: **YES**
