Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is a deque containing `v` as its first element, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers, `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree` (which is now `v`), and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree` (which is also `v`). The current value of `u` is equal to the first element of `tree` (which is now `v`).**
