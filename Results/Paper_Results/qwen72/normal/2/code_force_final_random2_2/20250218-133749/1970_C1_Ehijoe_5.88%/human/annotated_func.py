#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, each connecting two nodes u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The initial node for the game is given as an integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is `n - 1`, `u` and `v` are the last input integers, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque containing the nodes of the tree in a specific order where the first and last elements are the two leaves of the tree.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is `n - 1`, `u` and `v` are the last input integers, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing the nodes of the tree in a specific order where the first and last elements are the two leaves of the tree, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is odd, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, if all elements in `moves` are even, the program follows the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but reads inputs from standard input. It expects the first line to contain two integers, `n` and `t`, where `n` is the number of nodes in a tree (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) and `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ n). The next `n-1` lines define the edges of the tree, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge between nodes `u` and `v`. Finally, it reads an integer `start` (1 ≤ start ≤ n) indicating the starting node for a game. The function constructs a deque `tree` representing the nodes of the tree in a specific order where the first and last elements are the two leaves of the tree. It then calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach either leaf from the starting node, considering the maximum allowed moves `t`. If at least one of these minimum moves is odd, the function prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. After the function concludes, the state includes the original inputs, the constructed `tree` deque, and the result of the game ('Ron' or 'Hermione').
