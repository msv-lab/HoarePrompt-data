Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, representing the initial node for the game, the tree has exactly two leaves, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True.** 

The variable `empty` is set to `True`, and no other variables are affected. The initial conditions for `n`, `t`, and the structure of the tree remain unchanged.
