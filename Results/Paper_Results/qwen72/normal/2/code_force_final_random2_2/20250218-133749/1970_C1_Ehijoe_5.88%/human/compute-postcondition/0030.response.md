Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `empty` is True or False (unchanged), `tree` is a deque containing the integers `u` and `v`.** 

The code appends the integer `v` to the deque `tree`, which initially contains the integer `u`. All other variables remain unchanged.
