The code snippet `n, t = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. 

- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input, which represents the number of nodes in the tree.
- `t` is assigned the second integer from the input, which represents the initial node for the game.

The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The initial node for the game is given as an integer `u_1`, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. After executing the code, `n` and `t` are updated with the input values, and `t` now represents the initial node for the game.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, representing the initial node for the game, and the tree has exactly two leaves.**
