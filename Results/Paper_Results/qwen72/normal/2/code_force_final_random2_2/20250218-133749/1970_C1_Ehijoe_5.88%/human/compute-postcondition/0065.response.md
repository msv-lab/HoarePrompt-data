Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but reads inputs from standard input. It expects the first line to contain two integers, `n` and `t`, where `n` is the number of nodes in a tree (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) and `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ n). The next `n-1` lines define the edges of the tree, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge between nodes `u` and `v`. Finally, it reads an integer `start` (1 ≤ start ≤ n) indicating the starting node for a game. The function constructs a deque `tree` representing the nodes of the tree in a specific order where the first and last elements are the two leaves of the tree. It then calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach either leaf from the starting node, considering the maximum allowed moves `t`. If at least one of these minimum moves is odd, the function prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. After the function concludes, the state includes the original inputs, the constructed `tree` deque, and the result of the game ('Ron' or 'Hermione'). **
