Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5.
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ n.
- `i` is set to `n - 1`.
- `u` and `v` are the last input integers.
- `empty` is set to `False`.
- `tree` is a deque containing the nodes of the tree in a specific order, with the first and last elements being the two leaves of the tree.
- `start` is an input integer.
- `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.
- `moves` is a list containing `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`, and all elements in `moves` are even.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Hermione')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Hermione'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **Hermione**
