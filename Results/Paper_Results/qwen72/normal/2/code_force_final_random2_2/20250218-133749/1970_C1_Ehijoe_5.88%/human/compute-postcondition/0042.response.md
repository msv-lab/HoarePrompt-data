The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `t`, `i`, `empty`, or `tree`. However, it updates the values of `u` and `v` based on the input.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n
- `i` is 2
- `u` and `v` are input integers
- `empty` is True or False (unchanged)
- `tree` is a deque

After executing the code snippet:
- `u` and `v` are now the integers read from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the input integers, `empty` is True or False (unchanged), and `tree` is a deque.**
