Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is a deque, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u]`. Otherwise, if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains the integer `u`. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `v` as its first element, and `u` is equal to `v`. If `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree` and `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u, v]` and `u` is the second-to-last element of `tree`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.***
