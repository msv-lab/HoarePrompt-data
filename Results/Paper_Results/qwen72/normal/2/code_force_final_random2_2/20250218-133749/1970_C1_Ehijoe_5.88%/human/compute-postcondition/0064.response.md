The function `func_1` accepts parameters that define a tree structure and an initial node for a game. Specifically, it takes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and a list of `n-1` edges, each a tuple `(u, v)` (where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing connections between nodes. Additionally, it takes an integer `u_1` (where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the game. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.

The function returns the result of a game played on this tree starting from the initial node `u_1`.
