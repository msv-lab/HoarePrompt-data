Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the input integers, and `empty` is True or False (unchanged). If `empty` is True, `tree` is a deque containing `u` and `v`. If `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `u` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `u`. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `v`. If none of these conditions are met, `tree` remains unchanged.***
