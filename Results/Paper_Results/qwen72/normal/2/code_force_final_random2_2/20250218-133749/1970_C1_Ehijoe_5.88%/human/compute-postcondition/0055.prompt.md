Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, representing the initial node for the game, the tree has exactly two leaves, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers. If `empty` is True, then `tree` is a deque containing `[u, v]` and `empty` is False. If `empty` is False, then `tree` is a deque and `empty` is False. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u]`. Otherwise, if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains the integer `u`. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `v` as its first element, and `u` is equal to `v`. If `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree` and `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u, v]` and `u` is the second-to-last element of `tree`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `empty` is True or False (unchanged), and `tree` is a deque. If `empty` is True, `tree` is a deque containing the integers `u` and `v`. If `empty` is False, and if `v` equals the first element of `tree`, then `u` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `v` equals the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `u`. If `u` equals the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `v`. If none of these conditions are met, `tree` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the input integers, and `empty` is True or False (unchanged). If `empty` is True, `tree` is a deque containing `u` and `v`. If `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `u` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `u`. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `v`. If none of these conditions are met, `tree` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
