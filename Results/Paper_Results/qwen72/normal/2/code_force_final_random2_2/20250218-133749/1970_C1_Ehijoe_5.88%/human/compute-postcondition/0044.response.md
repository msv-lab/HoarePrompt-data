Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the input integers, `empty` is True or False (unchanged), and `tree` is a deque containing `u` and `v`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tree.append(v)` adds the integer `v` to the deque `tree`.
- Initially, `tree` contains only `u`.
- After executing the code, `tree` now contains both `u` and `v`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `empty`) remain unchanged.
