Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is `n - 1`, `u` and `v` are the last input integers, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque containing the nodes of the tree in a specific order where the first and last elements are the two leaves of the tree.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times, so `i` will be `n - 1` after the loop completes.
- `u` and `v` will hold the last pair of integers read from the input.
- `empty` will be False because it is set to False during the first iteration and never changes back.
- `tree` will contain the nodes of the tree in a specific order, with the first and last elements being the two leaves of the tree. This is because the loop constructs the tree by adding nodes to the deque based on their connections, ensuring that the deque represents the structure of the tree.
