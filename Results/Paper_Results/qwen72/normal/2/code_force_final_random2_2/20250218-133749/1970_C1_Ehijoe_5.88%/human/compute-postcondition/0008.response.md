Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is a deque containing `[u, v]`, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers, and the condition `empty` is True.**

Explanation:
- The code `tree.append(v)` adds the integer `v` to the end of the deque `tree`.
- Initially, `tree` contained only `[u]`. After appending `v`, `tree` now contains `[u, v]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`, `u`, and `v`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `empty` is still True, as it was not modified by the code.
