Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is a deque containing `[u, v]`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers, and `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. Additionally, `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree` before the append operation. Furthermore, `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree` before the append operation. The current value of `u` is equal to the second-to-last element of `tree`.**
