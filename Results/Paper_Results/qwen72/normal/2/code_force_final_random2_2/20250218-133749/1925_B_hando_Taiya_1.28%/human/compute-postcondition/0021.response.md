Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` remains the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, `i` is now 3, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`. If `n` <= 3, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`.***
