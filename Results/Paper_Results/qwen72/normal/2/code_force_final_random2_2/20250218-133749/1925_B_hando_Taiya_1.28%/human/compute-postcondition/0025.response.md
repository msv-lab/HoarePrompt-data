To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is the first integer from the input.
   - `n` is the second integer from the input.
   - `i` is calculated as `isqrt(x) + 1`, where `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`.
   - `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the maximum quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `isqrt(x)` returns the largest integer `k` such that \( k^2 \leq x \).
   - `i = isqrt(x) + 1` means `i` is one more than the integer square root of `x`.
   - `ans` is determined by finding the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the maximum quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Logic for Determining `ans`:**
   - To find the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, we iterate through all integers from `n` down to 1 and check if they divide `x` without a remainder.
   - If no such divisor is found, we then find the maximum quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
   - However, based on the given conditions, `ans` will be the maximum value between the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` and the largest quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the value of `ans` as described above.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or the maximum quotient of x divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to n)**
