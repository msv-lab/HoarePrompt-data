The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `isqrt(x) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `isqrt(x) + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` (now 3) must still be less than `isqrt(x) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` remains the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, `i` is now 3, and the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` (which is now 3) must be less than `isqrt(x) + 1`.**
