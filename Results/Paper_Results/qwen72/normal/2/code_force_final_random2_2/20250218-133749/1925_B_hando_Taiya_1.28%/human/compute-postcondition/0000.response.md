The code snippet `x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x` and `n` respectively. This means the values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the user's input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x

After executing the code:
- `x` is now the first integer from the input.
- `n` is now the second integer from the input.

The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input.**
