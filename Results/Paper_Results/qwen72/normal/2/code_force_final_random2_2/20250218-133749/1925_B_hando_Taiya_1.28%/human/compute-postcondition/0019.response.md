The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given the initial state:

- `t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` remains the first integer from the input and must be at least 1
- `n` remains the second integer from the input
- `i` is now 3
- The loop continues as long as `i` (which is now 3) is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`

Since `i` is 3, the new value of `ans` will be the maximum of its current value and 3. If `ans` was already greater than or equal to 3, it remains unchanged. If `ans` was less than 3, it will be updated to 3.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` remains the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, `i` is 3, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and 3, and the loop continues as long as `i` (which is 3) is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`.**
