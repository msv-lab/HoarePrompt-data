Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `l` has at least two elements, `ans1` contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`, `ans2` contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`, `k` is `k - 2`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
