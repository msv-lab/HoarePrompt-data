Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `b[3]` is equal to `b[2]`, `ans1` is updated with the element at index 3 of `b`, `k` is -2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[3]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `l` is updated with the element `b[3]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
