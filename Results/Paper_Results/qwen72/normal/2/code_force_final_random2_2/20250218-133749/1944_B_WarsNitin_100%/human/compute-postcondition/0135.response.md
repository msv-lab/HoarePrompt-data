The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `n-1` must be greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2 and `n-1` must be greater than 2, which means `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**
