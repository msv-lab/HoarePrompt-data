The value of `b[i]` is appended to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `b[1]` is appended to `ans1`. The condition that `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` means that `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` (which is also `b[0]`).**
