Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `l` must contain at least one element, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m` where `m` is the number of times `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true during the loop. `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true for any `i`, `ans2` now includes the corresponding values of `c[i]` appended twice, otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
