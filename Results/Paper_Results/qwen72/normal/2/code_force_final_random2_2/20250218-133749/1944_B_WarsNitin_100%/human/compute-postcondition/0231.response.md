The value of `b[i]` is appended to the list `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The condition that `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` still holds true.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, and `l` now includes the value of `b[i]`.**
