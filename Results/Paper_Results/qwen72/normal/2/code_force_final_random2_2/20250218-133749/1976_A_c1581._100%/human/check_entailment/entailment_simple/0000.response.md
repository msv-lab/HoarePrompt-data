### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Character Separation**: The `func_1` function separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done correctly using the `isdigit()` method.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts both the `digits` and `letters` lists. This ensures that the characters within each category are in non-decreasing order.

4. **Digit and Letter Order Check**:
   - The program checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. If any digit is greater than the next digit, it returns `False`.
   - The program also checks if any digit appears after a letter. This is done by comparing the last digit in the `digits` list with each letter in the `letters` list. If any letter is less than the last digit, it returns `False`.

5. **Final Comparison**: The program constructs a new string `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists. It then compares this sorted string with the original password. If they are equal, the password is considered strong, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the edge case where the password consists of only digits or only letters. However, the problem statement explicitly allows for such cases, so this is not an issue.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. It handles the input and output as required and performs the necessary checks to ensure the password is strong.

### Correctness:
**True**
