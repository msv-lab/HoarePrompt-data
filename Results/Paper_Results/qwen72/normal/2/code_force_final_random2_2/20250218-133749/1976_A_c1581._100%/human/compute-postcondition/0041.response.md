Output State: **The program returns False.** 

Explanation: Based on the conditions provided, if `i` is less than the length of `letters` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`, the function returns False. Since the code snippet explicitly includes a return statement with `False`, the program will return False regardless of the other conditions.
