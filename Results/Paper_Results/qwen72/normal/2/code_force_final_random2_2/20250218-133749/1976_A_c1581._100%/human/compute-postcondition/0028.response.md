Postcondition: ***`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 digit. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order. `i` is 1, and either `i` is equal to or greater than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`. Additionally, either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`. If `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
