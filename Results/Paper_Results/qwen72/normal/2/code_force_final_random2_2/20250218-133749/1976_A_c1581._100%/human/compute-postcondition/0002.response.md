The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, and the loop iterates over the string `password`. For the loop to execute, `password` must be a non-empty string. Since the state specifies that `password` is a string of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, this condition is already met, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute, as the given state already ensures that `password` is a valid string with at least one character.

State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**
