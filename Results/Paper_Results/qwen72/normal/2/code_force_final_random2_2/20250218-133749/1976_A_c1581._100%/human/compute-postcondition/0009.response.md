The code appends the value of `char` to the list `digits`. Since `char` is the next character in `password`, which is a string of length n-1 (1 ≤ n-1 ≤ 19) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` itself is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The `digits` list, which was previously defined, now includes this new character.

Output State: **`password` is a string of length n-1 (1 ≤ n-1 ≤ 19) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password`, `digits` is a list that now includes `char` as its last element.**
