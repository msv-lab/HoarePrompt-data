#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` in the order they appeared, and the `letters` list contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` in the order they appeared.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: `password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 digit. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order. `i` is `len(digits) - 1`, and either `i` is equal to or greater than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`. Additionally, either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`. If `i` is less than `len(letters)` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `password` as input, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and has a length between 1 and 20 characters. It separates the digits and letters from the `password`, sorts them in ascending order, and then checks if the sorted combination of digits followed by letters matches the original `password`. The function returns `True` if the sorted combination matches the original `password`, and `False` otherwise.
