Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` has a logical error in the way it checks the conditions for the password. Specifically, the check for whether any digit comes after a letter is not correctly implemented. The code incorrectly compares the last digit with every letter, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should ensure that once a digit appears in the password, no letter should follow it.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    has_digit = False
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
            has_digit = True
        elif has_digit:
            # If we encounter a letter after a digit, return False
            return False
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This version ensures that:
1. No digit comes after a letter.
2. All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

With this correction, the program should work as expected.
