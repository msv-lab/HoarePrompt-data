Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. Specifically, the check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect because it only checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not the intended logic. Instead, it should ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the password. A correct implementation would involve checking the relative positions of digits and letters directly.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  a1b2c
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

The program incorrectly returns "YES" for this input, even though the digit '1' comes after the letter 'a', violating the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
