The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the remaining characters in `password`. If there are more characters left in `password`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `password` is a string of length n-1 (1 ≤ n-1 ≤ 19), and `char` is the next character in `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character left in `password` to process. This means `password` must have a length of at least n (where n is the original length of `password` before the last iteration).

Therefore, for the next iteration:
- `char` will be the next character in `password`.
- The length of `password` must be at least n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).

State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list that now includes `char` as its last element. Otherwise, `letters` is a list containing `char`.**
