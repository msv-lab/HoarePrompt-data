To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop's ability to run, specifically the variables `i` and `n` as they are the only ones in the loop head.

- The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and should start at 0 for the loop to execute properly.
- The variable `n` determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is set to `n`, which means if `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.
- `n` is the new input integer, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `i` to 0 and confirm that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is `k - n * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is 0, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2`**
