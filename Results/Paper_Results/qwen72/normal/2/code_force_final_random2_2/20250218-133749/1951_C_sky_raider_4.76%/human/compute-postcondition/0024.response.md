Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is `k - n * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is 0, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is set to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `c`) retain their previous values or expressions.
- Since `s` is now 0, the expression `c = k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))` simplifies to `c = k * k / 2` because `sum(l[j] * 0 - 0 * 0 / 2 for j in range(n))` is 0.
