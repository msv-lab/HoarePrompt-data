Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is `k - n * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`.** 

The list `l` has been sorted in ascending order, while the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged.
