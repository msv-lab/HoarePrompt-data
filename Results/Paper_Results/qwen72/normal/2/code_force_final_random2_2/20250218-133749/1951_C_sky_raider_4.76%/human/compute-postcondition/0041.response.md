The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the new input. Let's analyze the impact:

- `n` is updated to the first integer from the input.
- `m` is updated to the second integer from the input.
- `k` is updated to the third integer from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `c`) are not directly affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged. However, since `n` and `k` are updated, the expressions involving these variables (`i`, `s`, `c`) will now use the new values of `n` and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is the new input integer
- `k` is `k - n * min(m, k) - (n-1) * min(m, k)`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(m, k) - min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2 for j in range(n))`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is updated to the new input integer.
- `m` is updated to the new input integer.
- `k` is updated to the new input integer.

The updated values of `i`, `s`, and `c` will depend on the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is the new input integer `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(m, k) - min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2 for j in range(n))`**
