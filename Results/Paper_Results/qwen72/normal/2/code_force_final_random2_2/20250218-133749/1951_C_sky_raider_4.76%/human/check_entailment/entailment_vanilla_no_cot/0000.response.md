Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `c`**: The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. This initialization is incorrect and does not represent any meaningful value in the context of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The calculation inside the loop `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The term `- s * s / 2` does not make sense in the context of calculating the cost of purchasing tickets. The cost should simply be the product of the number of tickets purchased and the price per ticket on that day.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Purchasing Tickets**: The logic for purchasing tickets is flawed. The program should consider the increasing prices due to previous purchases, but it does not handle this correctly. The current implementation does not account for the increase in prices after purchasing tickets on a given day.

4. **Handling of `k` and `m`**: The program should ensure that it does not purchase more tickets than available (`m`) or required (`k`). The current implementation does not handle these constraints properly.

A correct approach would involve:
- Sorting the prices to always buy the cheapest tickets first.
- Keeping track of the number of tickets purchased and the total cost.
- Adjusting the prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        prices.sort()
        
        total_cost = 0
        tickets_bought = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            if tickets_bought >= k:
                break
            to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            total_cost += price * to_buy
            tickets_bought += to_buy
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the tickets are bought in the most cost-effective manner, respecting the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day and the total number of tickets required.
