### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves determining the number of possible values for \( k \) given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling process.
   - The settling process repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 because no valid \( k \) can exist.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with arguments \((y - 2) // 2\) and \( x \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it calls `func_1` again with arguments \((n - x) // 2\) and \( x \).
   - It combines the results from both calls, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) and their corresponding quotients.
   - It also includes the square root of \( q \) if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for checking if \( y \) is odd and printing 0 is correct because \( y \) must be even for valid \( k \).
   - The calls to `func_1` with appropriate arguments are correct and follow the problem's constraints.
   - The combination of results and removal of duplicates is correctly implemented.
   - The conditions and calculations within `func_1` are consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
