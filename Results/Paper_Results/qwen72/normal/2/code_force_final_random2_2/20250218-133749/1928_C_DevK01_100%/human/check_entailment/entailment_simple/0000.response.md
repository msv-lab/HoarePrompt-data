Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, extracting the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `(n + x) % 2 != 0`. If this condition is true, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is valid because if `n + x` is odd, there cannot be any valid `k` that fits the pattern described in the problem.

3. **Function Call and List Operations**:
   - The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to get a list of potential `k` values.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and, if true, adds more potential `k` values by calling `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)`.
   - The results from both calls are combined into a single list `L1`, and duplicates are removed using `set`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is designed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients.
   - It initializes an empty list `M` and calculates the square root of `q` to optimize the divisor search.
   - It iterates through possible divisors `i` up to the square root of `q`, checking if `i` is a divisor and if it meets the condition `i >= x - 1`.
   - It also checks if the quotient `q // i` meets the condition `q // i >= x - 1` and adds it to the list `M`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the length of the unique list `L1`, which represents the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints.

**Conclusion**:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles edge cases appropriately. The function `func_1` efficiently finds the required divisors and their quotients, and the main logic ensures that the conditions for valid `k` values are met.

Correctness: **True**
