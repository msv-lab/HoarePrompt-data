To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition.

### Given State:
- `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\)
- `M` is an empty list or a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q`
- `w` is the square root of `q`
- `i` is 1

### Loop Condition:
```python
while i < w:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `w`.
- Right before the loop, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `w` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `i` is already 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
- The only variable that needs to be checked is `w`.
- `w` is the square root of `q`, and for the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
- For the loop to execute at least once, `w` must be greater than 1. This means `q` must be greater than 1 (since the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of any number greater than 1 is greater than 1).

### Final State:
- `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\)
- `M` is an empty list or a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q`
- `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1

State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is an empty list or a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q`, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
