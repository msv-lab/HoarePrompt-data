Output State: **q and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, M is an empty list or a list containing the integer value of the square root of q, w is the square root of q, i is 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial conditions remain unchanged: `q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9.
- `M` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q`, depending on whether `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- `w` is the square root of `q`.
- `i` is now 1, as it has been assigned this value by the code snippet.
