Postcondition: ***q and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, M is an empty list, and w is the square root of q. If w is an integer (i.e., w == w // 1) and w is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.***
