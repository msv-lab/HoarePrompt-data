Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). `M` is a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q` and the integer `1`. If `q` is divisible by 2 and `q // 2` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` also contains the value `q // 2`. `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
