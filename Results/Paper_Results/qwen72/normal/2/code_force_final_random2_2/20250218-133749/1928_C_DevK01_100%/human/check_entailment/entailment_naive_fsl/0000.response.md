Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the calculation of possible values of `k`. Specifically, the condition `if y % 2 != 0:` is used to check if `y` (which is `n + x`) is odd. If `y` is odd, the program immediately prints `0` and continues to the next test case. However, this condition is not always correct.

Consider the following counterexample:
- Input: `n = 5`, `x = 2`
- Expected Output: `2` (since `k = 2` and `k = 3` are both valid)
- Actual Output: `0` (because `y = 5 + 2 = 7` is odd, and the program incorrectly prints `0`)

This shows that the program fails to handle cases where `y` is odd but there are still valid values of `k` that satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
