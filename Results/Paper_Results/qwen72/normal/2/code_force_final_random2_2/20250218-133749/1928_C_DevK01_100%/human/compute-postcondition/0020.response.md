Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). `M` is a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q`, the integer `1`, and the integer `2` if `i` (which is 2) is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If `q` is divisible by `2` and `q // 2` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` also contains the value `q // 2`. If `q // i` (where `i` is 2) is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` additionally contains the integer `q // 2`. `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2.***
