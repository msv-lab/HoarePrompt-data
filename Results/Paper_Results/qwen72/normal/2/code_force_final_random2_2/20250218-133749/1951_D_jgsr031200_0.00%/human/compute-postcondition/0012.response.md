To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will iterate over the elements in the list `costs`.
- For the loop to execute, `costs` must contain at least one element.

### Current State of `costs`:
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The list `costs` must have at least one element.
- Since `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, it already contains two elements, so the loop will execute as long as `costs` is defined as given.

### Adjustments Needed:
- No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute because `costs` already contains two elements, ensuring that the loop will run at least once.

### Final State:
- The loop will execute with `i` taking the values from `costs`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is 0, `i` is the first element of `costs` (which is `n - k + 1`)**.
