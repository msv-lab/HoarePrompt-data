Output State: **`n` is the remainder of `n` divided by `n - k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- The code snippet `curr = n // i` updates the value of `curr` to `n // 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial values.
