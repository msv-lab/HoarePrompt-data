Reasoning:

The function `func_1` aims to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Case when `n == k`:**
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is correctly handled by printing 'YES', followed by 1 and 1.

2. **Case when `n < k`:**
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for her to buy `k` jewels. This is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.

3. **Case when `n >= k` and `n != k`:**
   - The function attempts to set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The idea is to use the first stall to reduce the number of coins Alice has to a point where she can only buy the remaining jewels at the second stall.
   - The loop calculates how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall and updates the remaining coins accordingly.
   - The variable `h` keeps track of the total number of jewels Alice can buy.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because Alice cannot buy enough jewels.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and the prices of the two stalls.

However, there is a logical issue in the implementation:

- The loop updates `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from `n`, but this is not necessary since `n` should remain unchanged for the second iteration of the loop.
- The calculation of `h` should be done correctly to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Let's correct the logic:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        return
    # Calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy at the first stall
    first_stall_price = n - k + 1
    first_stall_jewels = n // first_stall_price
    remaining_coins = n - first_stall_jewels * first_stall_price
    # Calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy at the second stall
    second_stall_price = 1
    second_stall_jewels = remaining_coins // second_stall_price
    total_jewels = first_stall_jewels + second_stall_jewels
    if total_jewels < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print(2)
        print('YES')
        print(first_stall_price, second_stall_price)
```

With this corrected logic, the function should work as intended. However, the original function as provided has logical issues that would lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Correctness: **False**
