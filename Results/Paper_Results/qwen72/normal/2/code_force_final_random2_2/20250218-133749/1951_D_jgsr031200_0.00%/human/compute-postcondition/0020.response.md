To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is `n - i * curr`
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18
- `n` is not equal to `k`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`
- `i` is `1`
- `curr` is `n`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the list `costs`.
- The list `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- The variable `i` takes on the values from the list `costs`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`.
2. **Next Value of `i`**: For the next iteration, `i` will take the next value from the list `costs`.
3. **List `costs`**: The list `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
4. **First Iteration**: In the first iteration, `i` was `1`.
5. **Second Iteration**: For the second iteration, `i` will be `n - k + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
- The list `costs` remains the same.

### Final State:
- `i` is now `n - k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n`**
