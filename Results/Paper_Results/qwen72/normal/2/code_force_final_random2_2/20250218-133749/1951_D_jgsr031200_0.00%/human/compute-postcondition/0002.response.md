The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `n` is equal to `k`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`. The values of `n` and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference these variables.

Output: **1**
