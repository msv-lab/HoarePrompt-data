Postcondition: ***After the loop executes all iterations, `n` is 0, `k` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is less than `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is the sum of the quotients from dividing `n` by each element in `costs` during the loop, `i` is 1, and `curr` is 0. If `h` is less than `k`, the condition `h < k` holds. Otherwise, `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
