The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, it is given that `n` is less than `k`.

The Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any variables or conditions; it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:
Output: **NO**
