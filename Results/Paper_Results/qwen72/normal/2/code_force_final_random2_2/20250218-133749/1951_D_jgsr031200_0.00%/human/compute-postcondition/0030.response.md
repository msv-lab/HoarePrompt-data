Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is less than `k`.
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients from dividing `n` by each element in `costs` during the loop.
- `i` is 1.
- `curr` is 0.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `costs`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - Substituting `n = 0` into the formula, we get:
     \[
     \text{costs} = [0 - k + 1, 1] = [-k + 1, 1]
     \]

2. **Determine the value of `h`:**
   - `h` is the sum of the quotients from dividing `n` by each element in `costs`.
   - Since `n` is 0, dividing 0 by any non-zero number results in 0.
   - Therefore, the quotients are:
     \[
     \frac{0}{-k + 1} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{0}{1} = 0
     \]
   - Summing these quotients:
     \[
     h = 0 + 0 = 0
     \]

3. **Check the condition `h` is greater than or equal to `k`:**
   - According to the initial state, `h` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
   - However, we calculated `h` to be 0, which contradicts the condition that `h` is greater than or equal to `k` (since `k` is a positive integer).

Given this contradiction, it seems there might be an inconsistency in the initial state. However, based on the provided initial state and the code snippet, we will proceed with the values as they are.

### Final Output:
The `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list, which are `[-k + 1, 1]`.

Output: **-k + 1, 1 (where k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18)**
