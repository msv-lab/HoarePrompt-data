Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` is 0, `k` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is less than `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is the sum of the quotients from dividing `n` by each element in `costs` during the loop, `i` is 1, and `curr` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: After the loop completes, `n` is reduced to 0 because the loop subtracts multiples of the elements in `costs` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `costs`, which is 1.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`costs`**: The list `costs` remains `[n - k + 1, 1]` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`h`**: The variable `h` accumulates the sum of the quotients from dividing `n` by each element in `costs` during each iteration of the loop.
- **`i`**: At the end of the loop, `i` is 1, which is the last element in `costs`.
- **`curr`**: The variable `curr` is 0 because the final value of `n` is 0, and `n // i` (where `i` is 1) is 0.
