The list `costs` is assigned two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and they still satisfy the conditions that they are positive integers, `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.**
