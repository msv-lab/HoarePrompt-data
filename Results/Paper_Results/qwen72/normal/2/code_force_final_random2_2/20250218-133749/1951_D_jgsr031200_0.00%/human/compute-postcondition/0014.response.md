The value of `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`. Given that `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, the new value of `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`**
