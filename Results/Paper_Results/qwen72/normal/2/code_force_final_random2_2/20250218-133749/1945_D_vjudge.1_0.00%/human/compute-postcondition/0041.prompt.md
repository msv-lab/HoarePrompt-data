You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000. lista_A and lista_B are lists of integers of length n, where each element is in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that were not compared with smaller elements in `lista_A`, and `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the cumulative sum of `soma_b` at those points. The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that were not compared with smaller elements in `lista_A` plus the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B`, `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the cumulative sum of `soma_b` at those points, `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged, `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all `i` from `n - k` to `n - 1`.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for all i from n - k to n - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`. It processes these parameters to return a result based on the elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` and the values of `n` and `k`. The exact nature of the result is not specified, but it likely involves some form of comparison or computation between the elements of the lists.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
