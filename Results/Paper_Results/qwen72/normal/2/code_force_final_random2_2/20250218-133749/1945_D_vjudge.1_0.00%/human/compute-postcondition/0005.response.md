The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `numero_testes`. The loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by `numero_testes`. At the end of the last iteration, `numero_testes` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `numero_testes` must still be a positive integer, but since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked, we can infer that the loop has one iteration left.

Since the loop uses an underscore (`_`) as the iterator, it does not actually use the value of `_` within the loop body. Therefore, the only relevant state is `numero_testes`.

At the start of the next iteration, `numero_testes` must still be a positive integer, and the loop will execute one more time if `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 - 1**
