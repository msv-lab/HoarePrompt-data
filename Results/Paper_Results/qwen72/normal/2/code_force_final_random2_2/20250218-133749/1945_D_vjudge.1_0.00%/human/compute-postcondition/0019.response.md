The value of `soma_b` is incremented by the value of the second element of `lista_B` (since `i` is 1). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 1, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers read from the input, `soma_b` is the sum of its initial value and the second element of `lista_B`, `pref` is either the first element of `lista_A` or 0 depending on the initial comparison.**
