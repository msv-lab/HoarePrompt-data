### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Kirill starts at the end of a queue of `n` people.
   - He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - Moving to position `j` from position `i` (where `j < i`) costs `a_j` coins plus `b_k` coins for each `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` to make it easier to handle the positions from the end of the queue.
   - It initializes `soma_b` to accumulate the cost of moving through intermediate positions.
   - It iterates through the first `n - k` positions to find the minimum cost to move to a position within the first `k` positions.
   - For each position `i` in the range `[n - k, n)`, it calculates the total cost to move to that position and updates the minimum cost.

3. **Code Review**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the input correctly and processes multiple test cases.
   - **Reversal of Lists**: Reversing the lists simplifies the logic for calculating the cost of moving to earlier positions.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - The loop from `0` to `n - k` ensures that Kirill considers moving to positions within the first `k` positions.
     - The inner logic correctly updates `pref` and `soma_b` to account for the minimum cost.
     - The final loop from `n - k` to `n` calculates the minimum cost to move to any of the first `k` positions.
   - **Output**: The function prints the minimum cost for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where `n` and `m` are small or large within the given constraints.
   - The use of `float('inf')` ensures that the initial value of `resultado` is set to a high value, which is necessary for finding the minimum cost.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input values for `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`.
  - **List Reversal**: Reversing the lists simplifies the logic for calculating the cost of moving to earlier positions.
  - **Cost Calculation**:
    - The loop from `0` to `n - k` correctly accumulates the cost of moving to positions within the first `k` positions.
    - The inner logic correctly updates `pref` and `soma_b` to account for the minimum cost.
    - The final loop from `n - k` to `n` correctly calculates the minimum cost to move to any of the first `k` positions.
  - **Output**: The function prints the minimum cost for each test case.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases and ensures it is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
  - **Test Case Execution**: The function correctly calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - **No Return Value**: The function does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, and the algorithm efficiently calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.

Final: **True**
