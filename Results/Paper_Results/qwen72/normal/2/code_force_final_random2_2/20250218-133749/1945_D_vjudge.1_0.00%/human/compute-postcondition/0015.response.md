The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `n`, and `k`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n - k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than `k` for the condition `i < n - k` to hold true.

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 1, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, and `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers read from the input. If the first element of `lista_A` is less than the first element of `lista_B`, then `pref` is set to the first element of `lista_A` and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is set to the first element of `lista_B` and `pref` remains 0.**
