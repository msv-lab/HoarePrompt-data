Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 1, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers read from the input, `pref` is now the sum of the first element of `lista_A` and the second element of `lista_A`, `soma_b` is 0.** 

The code snippet sets `soma_b` to 0, overriding its previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
