The function `func_1()` is called, but without knowing the definition of `func_1()`, we cannot determine its exact impact on the program state. However, since no changes to variables are explicitly made within the provided code snippet, we assume that the function does not modify any global variables or return any value that affects the current state.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed)**
