Output State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.**

### Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `numero_testes` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
- The loop runs `numero_testes` times, and each iteration calls the function `func_1()`.
- After all iterations of the loop, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times.
- The value of `numero_testes` remains unchanged because it is only used to control the number of iterations and is not modified within the loop.
- Therefore, the final output state is that `numero_testes` is still a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.
