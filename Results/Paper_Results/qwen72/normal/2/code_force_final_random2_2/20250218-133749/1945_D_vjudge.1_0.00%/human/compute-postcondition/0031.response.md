Output State: **`i` is `n - k`, `n` must be greater than `k`, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that were not compared with smaller elements in `lista_A` plus `lista_B[n - k]`, `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the cumulative sum of `soma_b` at those points, `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged, `resultado` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - k]`.**
