Output State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 - 1, `func_1()` has been called.** 

The function `func_1()` has been called, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine its impact on the program state. Therefore, the value of `numero_testes` remains unchanged.
