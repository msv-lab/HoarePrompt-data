The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `numero_testes`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not hold a specific value; it is used to indicate that the value is not needed. The loop's execution depends on `numero_testes`.

At the end of the last iteration, `numero_testes` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must still be a positive integer, but since `_` is just a placeholder, it does not change. The loop will execute as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

However, since the loop iterates over a fixed range defined by `numero_testes`, and each iteration consumes one unit of this range, the number of remaining iterations decreases by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must be at least 1 (since it was originally a positive integer between 1 and 10^4).

State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 - 1**
