Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that were not compared with smaller elements in `lista_A`, and `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the cumulative sum of `soma_b` at those points. The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n - k - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - k - 1`.
- **`soma_b`**: This variable accumulates the values of `lista_B[i]` whenever `lista_A[i]` is greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]`. At the end of the loop, `soma_b` will hold the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that were not compared with smaller elements in `lista_A`.
- **`pref`**: This variable accumulates the values of `lista_A[i]` whenever `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`. Additionally, it also adds the current value of `soma_b` at those points. Thus, `pref` will be the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the cumulative sum of `soma_b` at those points.
- **`lista_A` and `lista_B`**: These lists remain unchanged as the loop does not modify them.
