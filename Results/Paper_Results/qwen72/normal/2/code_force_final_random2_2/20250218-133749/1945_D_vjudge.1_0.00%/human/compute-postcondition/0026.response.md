Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 2, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, and `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers read from the input. If the first element of `lista_A` is less than the first element of `lista_B`, then `pref` is set to the sum of the first and second elements of `lista_A`, and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is set to the sum of its initial value and the second element of `lista_B`, and `pref` is either the first element of `lista_A` or 0 depending on the initial comparison.***
