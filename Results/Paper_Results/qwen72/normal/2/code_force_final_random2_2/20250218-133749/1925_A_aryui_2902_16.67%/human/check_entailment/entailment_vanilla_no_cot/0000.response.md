Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements. The function `func_1` simply repeats the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times, which does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the generated string `s`.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed to ensure that all combinations of length `n` are covered as subsequences. One common approach is to generate a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length exactly once. However, for this specific problem, a simpler but effective method is to concatenate all possible strings of length `n` formed by the first `k` alphabets, ensuring that all required subsequences are included.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]
    subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    result = ''.join(subsequences)
    print(result)
```

This program generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and concatenates them into a single string. This ensures that all required subsequences are present in the output string.
