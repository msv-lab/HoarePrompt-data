The code `num_up = s.count('U')` counts the number of occurrences of the character 'U' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `num_up`.

- `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only "U" and "D".
- `num_up` is now the number of times 'U' appears in `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only "U" and "D", `num_up` is the number of 'U' characters in `s`.**
