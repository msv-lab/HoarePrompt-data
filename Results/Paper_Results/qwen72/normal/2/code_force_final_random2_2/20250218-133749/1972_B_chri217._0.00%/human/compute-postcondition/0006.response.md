The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin is facing up and "D" indicates a coin is facing down. The function evaluates the state of the coins and returns 'YES' if all coins are facing up; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
