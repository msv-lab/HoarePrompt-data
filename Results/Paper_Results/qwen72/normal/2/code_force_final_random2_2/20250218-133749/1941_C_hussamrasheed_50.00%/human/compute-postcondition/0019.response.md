Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is 0, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. As a result, the value of `m`, which represents the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, is now 0. The value of `p`, which represents the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, remains unchanged unless 'map' was part of 'pie' in the original string. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`) remain unaffected.
