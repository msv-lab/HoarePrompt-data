Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the new `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.** 

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated to the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the new input string `s`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
