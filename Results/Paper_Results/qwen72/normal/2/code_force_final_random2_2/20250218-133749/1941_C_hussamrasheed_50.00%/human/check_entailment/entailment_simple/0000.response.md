Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and then removing them from the string. However, this approach is flawed because it only counts and removes "map" but does not account for the possibility that removing "map" could create new "pie" substrings, or vice versa. Additionally, the program simply adds the counts of "map" and "pie" and prints the result, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would count one "map" and one "pie", and output 2. However, the correct answer is 3, as you need to remove at least 3 characters to avoid both "map" and "pie".

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
