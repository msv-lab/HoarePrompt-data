Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p = s.count('pie')` updates the value of `p` to the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `m`) remain unchanged. The value of `p` is now specifically the count of 'pie' in the modified string `s`.
