The function `func` is described without explicit parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it seems to process multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with each `n` indicating the length of the corresponding string `s`, which consists of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes these inputs and returns some output based on the processing of each test case.

However, since the specific output is not detailed in the problem statement, I will assume that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each one, possibly related to the properties of the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
