Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and removes them, but this approach is flawed because:

1. It only counts and removes exact matches of "map" and "pie," which means it might miss cases where these substrings overlap or are part of longer sequences that need to be considered.
2. It does not account for the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. For example, in the string "mmapnapie," the program will count one "map" and one "pie," leading to an output of 2, but the correct answer is also 2, which can be achieved by deleting different characters (e.g., the 4th and 9th characters).

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach to find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the final string. This could involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to track the positions of these substrings and calculate the minimum deletions accordingly.
