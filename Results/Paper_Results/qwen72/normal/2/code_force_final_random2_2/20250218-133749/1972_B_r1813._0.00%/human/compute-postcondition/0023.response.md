The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. This impacts the `results` list, which now contains two elements: the original element ('YES' or 'NO') and the newly appended 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is 5, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 3, `data[0]` must be a positive integer, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO' followed by 'YES', `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is the string value of `data[4]`, `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' characters in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` originally contained 'YES'. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` originally contained 'NO'.**
