The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the `results` list.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one element (either 'YES' or 'NO'). For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements. The variable `result` will take the value of the next element in the `results` list.

State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `results` is a list containing at least two elements (either 'YES' or 'NO')**
