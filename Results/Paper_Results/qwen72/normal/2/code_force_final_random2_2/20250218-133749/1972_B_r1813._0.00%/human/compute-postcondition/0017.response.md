The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop will execute as long as there are iterations left in the range defined by `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 3, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and the loop has already run once (since `index` starts at 0 and is now 3, implying 3 iterations have completed).

For the loop to execute one more time, the range defined by `t` must still have iterations remaining. Since the loop has run 3 times, `t` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop has run 3 times and `t` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is 3, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 3, `data[0]` must be a positive integer, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the string value of `data[2]`, and `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' characters in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` contains 'YES'. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` contains 'NO'.**
