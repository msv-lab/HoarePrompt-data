The function reads from standard input a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" characters. It processes each test case to determine if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, appending 'YES' to the results list if true, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the results list to the standard output. The final state of the program includes a list of results corresponding to each test case, which has been printed out.
