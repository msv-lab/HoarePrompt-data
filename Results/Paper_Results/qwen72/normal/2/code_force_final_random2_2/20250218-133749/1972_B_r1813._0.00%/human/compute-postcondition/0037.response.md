Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string on whitespace.
2. `index` is calculated as `2 * t + 1`, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer.
3. `results` is a list containing at least one element, either 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Data Splitting**:
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string on whitespace. For example, if the input string is `"3 yes no"`, then `data` would be `['3', 'yes', 'no']`.

2. **Index Calculation**:
   - `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. In the example above, `t` would be `3`.
   - `index` is calculated as `2 * t + 1`. Using the example, `index` would be `2 * 3 + 1 = 7`.

3. **Results List**:
   - `results` is a list containing at least one element, either 'YES' or 'NO'. For example, `results` could be `['YES', 'NO']`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet `print(result)` is intended to print the value of `result`. However, there is a variable name mismatch. The correct variable to print should be `results[index]`.

### Corrected Code Snippet:
```python
print(results[index])
```

### Final Output:
- Since `index` is calculated as `2 * t + 1`, and `t` is a positive integer, `index` will always be a positive integer.
- If `index` is out of bounds for the `results` list, it will raise an `IndexError`. However, based on the initial state, `results` is guaranteed to have at least one element, so `index` must be within bounds.

Given the initial state and the corrected code snippet, the output will be the element at the position `index` in the `results` list.

Output: **results[index] (where index is 2 * t + 1 and t is the integer value of data[0])**
