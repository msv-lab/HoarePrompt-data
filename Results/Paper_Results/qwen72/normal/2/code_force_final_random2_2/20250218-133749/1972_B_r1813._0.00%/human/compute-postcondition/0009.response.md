Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is 2, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `data[0]` must be a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the string value of `data[2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `s`. Since `index` is 2, `s` now holds the string value of `data[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
