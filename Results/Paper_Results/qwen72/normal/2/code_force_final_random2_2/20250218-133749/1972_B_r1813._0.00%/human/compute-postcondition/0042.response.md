Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `results` is a list containing the final number of elements (either 'YES' or 'NO') equal to the number of strings in `data` after all iterations of the loop have completed.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each string in the `data` list, indicating whether the count of 'U' characters in each string was odd or even, respectively. The `data` list and the `index` variable remain unchanged from their initial states.
