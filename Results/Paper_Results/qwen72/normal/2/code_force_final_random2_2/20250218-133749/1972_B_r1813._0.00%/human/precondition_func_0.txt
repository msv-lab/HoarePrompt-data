The function should actually accept parameters to represent the input described in the problem. A corrected function definition would be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters.
