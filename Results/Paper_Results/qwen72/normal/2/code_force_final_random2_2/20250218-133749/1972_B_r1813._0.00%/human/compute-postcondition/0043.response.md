The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results.**
