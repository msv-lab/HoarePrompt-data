You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers (x, y, z) between 1 and 9 (inclusive). For each set, it determines and prints a string (`res`) based on the following conditions: if `x < y` and `y > z`, `res` is 'peak'; if `x < y` and `y < z`, `res` is 'stair'; otherwise, `res` is 'none'. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes `i` being 1001, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The program should read an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should read three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It should then determine if these digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions provided.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses the `random` module to generate random digits `x`, `y`, and `z` between 1 and 9.
   - It does not read input from the user or standard input, which is required according to the problem statement.
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified by the input format.
   - The logic for determining "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" is partially correct but incomplete:
     - It correctly identifies a "PEAK" when `x < y > z`.
     - It correctly identifies a "STAIR" when `x < y < z`.
     - However, it incorrectly labels all other cases as "NONE" without considering the possibility that `x >= y` could still result in a "PEAK" or "STAIR" if `y` and `z` satisfy the conditions.
   - The program prints the generated digits and the result, but it does not follow the required output format.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not meet the requirements of reading input and handling multiple test cases.
   - The logic for determining the type of sequence is incomplete and incorrect in some cases.
   - The output format does not match the expected output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
