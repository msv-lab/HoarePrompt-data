The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the condition `i <= 1000`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than or equal to 1000. Given that `i` is 1, which is already less than 1000, the loop condition is satisfied, and no adjustments are necessary.

State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; i is 1**
