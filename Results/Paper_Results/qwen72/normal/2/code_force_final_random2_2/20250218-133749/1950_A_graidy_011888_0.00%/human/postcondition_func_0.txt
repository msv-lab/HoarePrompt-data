The function `func` generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers (x, y, z) between 1 and 9 (inclusive). For each set, it determines and prints a string (`res`) based on the following conditions: if `x < y` and `y > z`, `res` is 'peak'; if `x < y` and `y < z`, `res` is 'stair'; otherwise, `res` is 'none'. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes `i` being 1001, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
