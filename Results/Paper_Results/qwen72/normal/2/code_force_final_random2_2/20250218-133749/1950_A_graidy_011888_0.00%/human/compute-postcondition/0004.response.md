Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, a, b, and c are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, i is 1, x is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), y is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), z is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).** 

The initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of the variable `z`, which is now a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
