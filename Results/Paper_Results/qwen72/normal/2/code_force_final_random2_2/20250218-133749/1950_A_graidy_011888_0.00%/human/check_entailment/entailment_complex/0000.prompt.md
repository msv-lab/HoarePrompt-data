Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, a, b, and c are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, i is 1001. For each iteration from 1 to 1000, x, y, and z were random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). The value of res was determined based on the conditions: if x < y, then if y > z, res was 'peak'; if y < z, res was 'stair'; if y == z, res was 'none'. If x >= y, res was 'none'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers (x, y, z) between 1 and 9 (inclusive). For each set, it determines and prints a string (`res`) based on the following conditions: if `x < y` and `y > z`, `res` is 'peak'; if `x < y` and `y < z`, `res` is 'stair'; otherwise, `res` is 'none'. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes `i` being 1001, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
