You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Annotated Code: 
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, a, b, and c are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, i is 1001. For each iteration from 1 to 1000, x, y, and z were random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). The value of res was determined based on the conditions: if x < y, then if y > z, res was 'peak'; if y < z, res was 'stair'; if y == z, res was 'none'. If x >= y, res was 'none'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider the following scenarios:

1. When `x == y` or `y == z`, the program incorrectly labels these cases as "none", which may not always be correct according to the problem description. For example, if `x == y == z`, it should be labeled as "NONE", but the current logic might not handle this correctly.

2. The program does not handle the case where `x > y` and `y < z`. In this scenario, the program will incorrectly label it as "none", whereas it should be "NONE".

3. The program does not handle the case where `x == y` and `y < z` or `x < y` and `y == z`. These cases should also be labeled as "NONE", but the current logic might not handle them correctly.

4. The program generates random inputs, which is not aligned with the problem description that specifies the input format and the need to read from standard input.

Here is a corrected version of the program that handles all the cases correctly:

```python
def solve(a, b, c):
    if a < b < c:
        return "STAIR"
    elif a < b > c:
        return "PEAK"
    else:
        return "NONE"

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve(a, b, c))
```

This version correctly reads the input as specified, and it handles all the edge cases as described in the problem statement.
