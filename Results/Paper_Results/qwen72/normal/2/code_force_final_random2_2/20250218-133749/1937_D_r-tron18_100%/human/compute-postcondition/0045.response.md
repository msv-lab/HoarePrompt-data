To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

1. **Identify the variables and their initial values:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
   - `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`.
   - `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
   - `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.

2. **Analyze the code:**
   ```python
   ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
   ```

3. **Calculate the new value of `ans[i]`:**
   - `ans[i]` is updated to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.

4. **Determine the final state:**
   - The value of `ans[i]` is now `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.**
