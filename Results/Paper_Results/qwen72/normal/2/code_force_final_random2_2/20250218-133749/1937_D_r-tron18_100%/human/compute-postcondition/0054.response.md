To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Values:**
   - `suffZero` is a list with an additional element `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`, the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `func_1` is a function that we assume returns some value based on its inputs.

2. **Evaluate `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` and `func_1(suffZero, 1)`:**
   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` returns a value based on the list `suffZero` and the index `ol + 1`.
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` returns a value based on the list `suffZero` and the index `1`.

3. **Calculate `zeroInd`:**
   - `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

### Impact on the Program:
- The only variable that changes is `zeroInd`.
- All other variables (`el`, `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `i`, `ol`, `zr`, and `suffZero`) remain unchanged.

### Output State Calculation:
- `zeroInd` is set to the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` has one additional element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.
