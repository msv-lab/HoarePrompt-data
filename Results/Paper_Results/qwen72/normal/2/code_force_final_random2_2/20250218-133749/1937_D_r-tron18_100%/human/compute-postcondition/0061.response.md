Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, and `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `el`, `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variable `ol` is assigned the value of `totalOne`.
- The variable `zr` is assigned the value of `len(suffZero) - 1`.

Thus, the output state reflects these assignments while keeping all other variables and their values unchanged.
