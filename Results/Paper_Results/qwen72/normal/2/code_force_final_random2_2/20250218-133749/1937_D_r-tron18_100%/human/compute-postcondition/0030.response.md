To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

1. **Identify the function calls and their parameters:**
   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)`
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`

2. **Understand the function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` is not explicitly defined, but based on the context, it seems to be a function that returns an index or a value from the `suffZero` list. For simplicity, let's assume `func_1` returns the value at the specified index in the `suffZero` list.

3. **Evaluate the function calls:**
   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)`: This call returns the value at index `ol + 1` in the `suffZero` list.
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`: This call returns the value at index `1` in the `suffZero` list.

4. **Calculate the value of `zeroInd`:**
   - `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`

Given the initial state:
- `suffZero` is a list `[0, n]`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.

Let's evaluate the function calls:
- `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)`: Since `ol` is `totalOne`, and `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, the index `ol + 1` is out of bounds for the list `suffZero`. However, if we assume `func_1` handles out-of-bounds gracefully and returns the last valid element, `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` would return `n`.
- `func_1(suffZero, 1)`: This returns the value at index `1` in `suffZero`, which is `n`.

Now, calculate `zeroInd`:
- `zeroInd = 2 * n - n = n`

Therefore, the output state is:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list [0, n].
- `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1`, and `el` is not '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zr` is greater than `ol`.
- `zeroInd` is `n`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list [0, n], `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1`, and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n`.**
