The code snippet `zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]` assigns the value of `2 * suffZero[-1]` to the variable `zeroInd`. 

Given the initial state:
- `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`
- `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `ol` is `totalOne`
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * suffZero[-1]`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`.**
