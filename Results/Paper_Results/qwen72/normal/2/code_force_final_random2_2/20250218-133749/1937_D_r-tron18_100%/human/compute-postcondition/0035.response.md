To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions given:

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```
This loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

### States in the Loop Head
The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

### Current State
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1`
- `ol` is `totalOne`
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`

### Adjustments Needed
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. The new value of `i` will be `n - 2`.

### Updated State
After adjusting `i`:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `el` will now be the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`
- `ol` remains `totalOne`
- `zr` remains `len(suffZero) - 1`

### Final State
State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0. If `el` (the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`) is '>', then `totalOne` is decremented by 1, and the last element of `preOne` is removed. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated to [0, n]. If `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) is less than or equal to `ol` (which is `totalOne`), then `ans[i]` is set to `2 * n - 1 - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`, and `zeroInd` is `2 * n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `zr` is greater than `ol`, then `ans[n-2]` is set to `n - 2 * preOne[-1]`, and `zeroInd` is `n`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`. In both cases, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, and `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**
