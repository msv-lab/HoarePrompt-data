Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` has one additional element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`.
- All other variables (`el`, `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `i`, `ol`, `zr`, `suffZero`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are defined as given in the initial state.
