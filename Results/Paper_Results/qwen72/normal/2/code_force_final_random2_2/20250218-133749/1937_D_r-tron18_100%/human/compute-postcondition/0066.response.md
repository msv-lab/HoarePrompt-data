The code snippet assigns the value `2 * suffZero[-1]` to the variable `zeroInd`. Since `suffZero` is a list and `-1` refers to the last element of the list, `zeroInd` will be twice the value of the last element in `suffZero`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the assignment to `zeroInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`.**
