To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial Values:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

2. **Analyze the Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet assigns the result of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` to the variable `zeroInd`.
   - `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments: `suffZero` and `ol`.
   - The result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is multiplied by 2 and stored in `zeroInd`.

3. **Determine the Impact on the Program:**
   - The only variable that changes is `zeroInd`.
   - The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Calculate the Result:**
   - The exact value of `zeroInd` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the values of `suffZero` and `ol`.
   - Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `zeroInd`. However, we know that `zeroInd` is twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

### Output State:
**`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol).**
