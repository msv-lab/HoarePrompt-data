The code snippet `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `i` is currently `n - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `n`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.

Given these values, the new value of `ans[i]` is calculated as:
\[ \text{ans}[i] = \text{zeroInd} - \text{oneInd} = n - 2 \times \text{preOne}[-1] \]

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list [0, n], `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ans[n-1]` which is now `n - 2 * preOne[-1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1` and is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1` and is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
