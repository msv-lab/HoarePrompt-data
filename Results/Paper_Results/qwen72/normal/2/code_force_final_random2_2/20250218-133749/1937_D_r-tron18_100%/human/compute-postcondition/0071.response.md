Postcondition: ***`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1_result`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. Otherwise, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
