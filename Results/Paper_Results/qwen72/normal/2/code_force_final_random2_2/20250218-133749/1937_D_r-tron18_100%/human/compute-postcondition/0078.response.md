To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

1. **Identify the variables and their initial values:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
   - `suffZero` is updated to include a new element which is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`.
   - `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] + (n - 2)`.
   - `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.

2. **Analyze the code snippet:**
   ```python
   ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
   ```

3. **Determine the changes:**
   - The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `ans[i]`:**
   - `zeroInd` is already defined as `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] + (n - 2)`.
   - `oneInd` is already defined as `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
   - `n` is a known positive integer.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.

5. **Construct the output state:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - The only change is the assignment to `ans[i]`.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` is updated to include a new element which is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] + (n - 2)`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.**
