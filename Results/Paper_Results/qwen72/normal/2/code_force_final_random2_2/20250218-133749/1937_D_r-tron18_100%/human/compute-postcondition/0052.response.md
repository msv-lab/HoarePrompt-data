To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial Values:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
   - `suffZero` has one additional element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`.
   - `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-2] + n - 1`.

2. **Analyze the Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` introduces a new variable `oneInd`.
   - `func_1(preOne, zr)` is a function call that takes two arguments: `preOne` and `zr`.
   - The result of `func_1(preOne, zr)` is multiplied by 2 and assigned to `oneInd`.

3. **Determine the Impact on the Program:**
   - The only variable that changes is `oneInd`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Calculate the Result:**
   - The exact value of `oneInd` depends on the implementation of `func_1(preOne, zr)`.
   - Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact value of `oneInd`. However, we know that `oneInd` is twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` has one additional element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-2] + n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
