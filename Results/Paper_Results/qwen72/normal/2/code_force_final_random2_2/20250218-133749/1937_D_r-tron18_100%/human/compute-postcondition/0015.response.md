Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The variable `oneInd` is calculated using the function `func_1` applied to `preOne` at indices `zr` (which is 0) and `zr + 1` (which is 1).
- The value of `oneInd` is thus the sum of `func_1(preOne, 0)` and `func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
