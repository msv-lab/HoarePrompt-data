### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the required parameters `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`.

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The function checks if `xa` (Alice's row) is greater than `xb` (Bob's row). If this is true, the function prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, so they cannot meet.

3. **Distance Calculation**: If `xa` is not greater than `xb`, the function calculates the half-distance `x` between Alice's and Bob's positions using `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.

4. **Odd Distance Case**:
   - If the distance between `xa` and `xb` is odd, the function calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - It then checks if Alice's column `ya` is within the range `[l - 1, r + 1]` (since `x` is the half-distance, the actual range is extended by 1 on both sides). If `ya` is within this range, Alice can win; otherwise, it's a draw.

5. **Even Distance Case**:
   - If the distance between `xa` and `xb` is even, the function calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - It then checks if Bob's column `yb` is within the range `[l, r]`. If `yb` is within this range, Bob can win; otherwise, it's a draw.

6. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is either "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw".

### Correctness:
The logic and implementation of the function appear to correctly handle the problem as described. The conditions and calculations are consistent with the rules of the game, and the function correctly determines the outcome for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
