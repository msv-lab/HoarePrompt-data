### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. Each test case is read as six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`.

2. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - If `xa > xb`, it means Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, so Alice cannot move down anymore, and the game ends in a draw. This is correctly handled by printing "Draw".

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance between Alice's and Bob's chips in the vertical direction is calculated as `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - The modulo operation `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is used to determine if the distance is odd or even.

4. **Odd Distance Case**:
   - If the distance is odd, the function calculates the range of possible y-coordinates where Alice can move her chip to win.
   - `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)` define the range of y-coordinates.
   - The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` checks if Alice can move her chip within this range to win. If true, "Alice" is printed; otherwise, "Draw" is printed.

5. **Even Distance Case**:
   - If the distance is even, the function calculates the range of possible y-coordinates where Bob can move his chip to win.
   - `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)` define the range of y-coordinates.
   - The condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` checks if Bob can move his chip within this range to win. If true, "Bob" is printed; otherwise, "Draw" is printed.

### Correctness:
The logic in the program appears to correctly handle the conditions for determining the winner or a draw based on the problem description. The conditions for Alice and Bob winning are well-defined and the program correctly prints the appropriate result for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
