Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `t - 1`, and `t` remains unchanged. The values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are reset to new integers from the input for each iteration. For each iteration, if `xa` > `xb`, no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. If the absolute difference is even, `l` is set to `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be one less than the total number of test cases `t`. The value of `t` itself does not change throughout the loop. For each iteration, the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are updated with new values from the input. Depending on the conditions within the loop, the variables `x`, `l`, and `r` are calculated based on the values of `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, and `yb`. These calculations determine whether the output is "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob" for each test case.
