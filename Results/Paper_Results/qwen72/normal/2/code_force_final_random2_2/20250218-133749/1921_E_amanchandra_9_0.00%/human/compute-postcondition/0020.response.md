Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is equal to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.** 

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value of the maximum between 1 and `yb - x`. The value of `x` is already defined as the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2. All other variables (`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `i`, `t`) remain unchanged.
