The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. Since the input is split and converted to integers, each of these variables will now hold an integer value. The initial state specifies that `i` is 0 and `int(input())` must be greater than 0, which means `t` is greater than 0. However, `t` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input.**
