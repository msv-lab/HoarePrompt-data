Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the t test cases consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and (x_a, y_a) ≠ (x_b, y_b).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
    if xa > xb:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
        if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
            l = max(1, yb - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r -
                ya) <= x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, ya - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, no changes are made to the variables. If `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is set to `(xb - xa) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is set to the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0. If `xa` > `xb`, no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `x` is equal to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. If the absolute difference is even, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1. If `xa` > `xb`, the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true, `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is false, `l` is set to `max(1, ya - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
