Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is equal to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is calculated as the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
