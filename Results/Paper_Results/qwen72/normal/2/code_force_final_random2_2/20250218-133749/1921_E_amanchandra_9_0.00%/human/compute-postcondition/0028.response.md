The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input value that determines the range of the loop. The state of `i` needs to be adjusted as it is incremented with each iteration of the loop. The input value, which is the upper limit for the range of the loop, remains constant and does not change.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than the input value (which is `t`).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1. If `xa` > `xb`, no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `x` is equal to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. If the absolute difference is even, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.**
