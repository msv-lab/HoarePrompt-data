Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is equal to `(xb - xa) // 2`, `l` is equal to `max(1, yb - x)`, `r` is equal to `min(w, yb + x)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`. This means `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `yb + x`.
- All other variables (`i`, `t`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `x`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
