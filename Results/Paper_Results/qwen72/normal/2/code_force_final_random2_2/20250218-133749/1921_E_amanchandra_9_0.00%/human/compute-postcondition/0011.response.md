Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is equal to `(xb - xa) // 2`, the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`.** 

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value of the maximum between 1 and `ya - x`. The value of `x` is calculated as `(xb - xa) // 2`, and since the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `x` is an integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
