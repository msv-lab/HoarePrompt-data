Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is equal to `(xb - xa) // 2`, the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is calculated as the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
- All other variables (`i`, `t`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `x`, and `l`) retain their initial values or conditions.
