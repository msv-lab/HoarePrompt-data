Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input.
- `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`.
- `x` is equal to \((xb - xa) // 2\).
- `l` is equal to \(\max(1, yb - x)\).
- `r` is equal to \(\min(w, yb + x)\).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = (xb - xa) // 2`
   - This is the integer division of the difference between `xb` and `xa` by 2.

2. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, yb - x)`
   - This ensures that `l` is at least 1 and at most `yb - x`.

3. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, yb + x)`
   - This ensures that `r` is at most `w` and at least `yb + x`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - The condition is `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`.
   - This checks if the absolute differences between `l` and `ya` and between `r` and `ya` are both less than or equal to `x + 1`.

5. **Determine the Output:**
   - If the condition is true, the print statement will output `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is false, the print statement will output `['Draw']`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output either `Draw` or `Alice` based on the condition. Since the exact values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `w`, and `h` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `l` and `r`. However, the output will be determined by the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`.

Output: **Draw or Alice (depending on the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`)**
