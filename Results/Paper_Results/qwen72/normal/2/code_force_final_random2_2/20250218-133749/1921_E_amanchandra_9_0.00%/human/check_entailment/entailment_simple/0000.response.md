### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates through each test case, reading the necessary parameters (`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`).

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The program checks if `xa > xb`. If this condition is true, it prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move her chip to a higher row than Bob's current position, and Bob cannot move his chip to a lower row than Alice's current position. This ensures that neither player can win, leading to a draw.

3. **Odd Difference Case**:
   - If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, the program calculates the maximum and minimum possible column positions (`l` and `r`) that Alice can reach after moving `x` steps.
   - It then checks if Alice's current column position (`ya`) is within the range `[l, r]` plus one step. If so, Alice can potentially win, and the program prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

4. **Even Difference Case**:
   - If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, the program calculates the maximum and minimum possible column positions (`l` and `r`) that Bob can reach after moving `x` steps.
   - It then checks if Bob's current column position (`yb`) is within the range `[l, r]`. If so, Bob can potentially win, and the program prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the board dimensions or initial positions are at the boundaries of the board.
   - The logic ensures that the game state is correctly evaluated for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the specified conditions and edge cases. The logic for determining the winner or a draw is sound and aligns with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
