The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` was initially 0 if the new `op` was not 0, or 1 if the new `op` was 0. After the increment, `cnt` will be 1 if the new `op` was not 0, or 2 if the new `op` was 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` remains 28, `u` remains `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0), `v` remains `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` (and `v` is even and non-zero), `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)` (where `val` is the next element in `a`), `a` remains a list that must have at least one element, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged, `cnt` is 1 if the new `op` is not 0, or 2 if the new `op` is 0.**
