Postcondition: ***`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` has at least three elements, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is the XOR of the original `op` and the 29th bit of the second element of `a`, and the 29th bit of the third element of `a`, `ai` is 0, and `t` is a list containing the value 0 if `op` is 0. Otherwise, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, and `t` remains unchanged.***
