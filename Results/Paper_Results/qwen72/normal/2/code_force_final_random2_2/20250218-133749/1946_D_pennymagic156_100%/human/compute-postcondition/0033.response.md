Output State: **`a` is now an empty list, `t` is a list containing the results of `ai` being reset to 0 whenever `op` is 0, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is the result of the XOR operation on the 29th bit of all elements in the original `a`, and `ai` is 0 if `op` was 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise it is the XOR of all elements in the original `a`.**
