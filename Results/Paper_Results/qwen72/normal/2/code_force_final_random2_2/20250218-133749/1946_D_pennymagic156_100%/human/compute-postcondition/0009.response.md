Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29. The bit at position 29 of `x` (`u`) is 0. The sum of the bits at position 29 of each element in `a` (`v`) is 0, and the current value of `v` is odd (i.e., `v % 2` is 1).**
