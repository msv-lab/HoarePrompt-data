Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element, `val` is the first element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is increased by 1, and the current value of `op` is 0.** 

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `op` is still 0.
