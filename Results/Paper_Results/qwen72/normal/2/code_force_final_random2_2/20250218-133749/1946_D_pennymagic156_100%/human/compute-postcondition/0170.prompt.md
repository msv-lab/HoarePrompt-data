You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, x is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\), and a is a list of n non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).
def func_5():
    n, x = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    t, ans = [], -1
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
        
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                a, t = t, []
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `i` is -1, `u` is `x >> -1 & 1` (which is 0), `v` is `sum([(val >> -1 & 1) for val in a])` (which is 0). The list `a` may have been modified based on the operations within the loop, but its final state depends on the specific values of `x` and the elements in `a`. The list `t` is an empty list. The variable `ans` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, or -1 if no such value was found.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. `ans` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, or -1 if no such value was found. The length of the list `a` is the number of elements currently in `a` after any modifications.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`, `x` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). The function returns -1 in some cases, the initial value of `ans` in other cases, or the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. `ans` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, or -1 if no such value was found.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `ans`, which remains unchanged from its initial state.

Case_3: The program returns the value of `ans`, which remains unchanged from its initial state.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. `ans` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, or -1 if no such value was found. The length of the list `a` is the number of elements currently in `a` after any modifications.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
