Output State: **`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` must have at least two elements, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is the XOR of the original `op` and the 29th bit of `val`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `t` is now `t` with `ai` appended to it.** 

Explanation:
- The code `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`.
- All other variables (`i`, `u`, `v`, `a`, `val`, `op`) remain unchanged.
- The new state of `t` is `t` with the additional element `ai`.
