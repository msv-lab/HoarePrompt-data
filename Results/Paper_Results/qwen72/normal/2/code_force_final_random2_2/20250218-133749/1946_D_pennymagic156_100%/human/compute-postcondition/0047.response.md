The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least two elements, `val` is the second element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
