The value of `op` is updated using the bitwise XOR operation with the result of shifting `val` right by `i` bits and then performing a bitwise AND with 1. This operation modifies `op`. If `op` becomes 0 after this update, `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's break down the changes:
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- If the new value of `op` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements, `val` is the third element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and if `op` is 0 after the update, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
