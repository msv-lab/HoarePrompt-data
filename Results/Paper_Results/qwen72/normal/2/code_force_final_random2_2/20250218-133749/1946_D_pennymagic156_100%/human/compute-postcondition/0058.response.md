Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 of `x` (`u`) is 1, and the sum of the bits at position 29 of each element in `a` (`v`) is even (i.e., `v % 2 == 0`). If `v` is true, `op` is the result of XORing the most significant bit (bit 29) of each element in `a`, `cnt` is the count of how many times `op` was 0 after processing each element in `a`, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
