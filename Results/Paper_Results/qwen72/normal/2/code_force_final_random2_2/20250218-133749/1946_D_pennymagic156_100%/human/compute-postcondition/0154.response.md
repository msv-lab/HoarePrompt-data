Output State: **`i` is 27, `u` is 1, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `new_val >> 27 & 1 ^ val >> 27 & 1`, `cnt` is 1 or 2, and `a` is a list that must have at least two elements.** 

The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so if it was initially 0, it is now 1, and if it was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
