### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to handle different types of input. These functions are used to read the input data.
   - `func_3` reads the first line of each test case, which contains the values of `n` and `x`.
   - `func_1` reads the second line of each test case, which contains the array `a`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main function `func_5` processes each test case.
   - It initializes variables `t` (a temporary list) and `ans` (the answer, initially set to -1).
   - The loop iterates over the bits from 29 to 0 (since \(0 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It extracts the `i`-th bit of `x` and the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
     - If both `u` (the `i`-th bit of `x`) and `v` (the sum of the `i`-th bits of `a`) are 0, it continues to the next bit.
     - If `u` is 0 and `v` is odd, it returns the current value of `ans` because it's impossible to satisfy the condition.
     - If `u` is 0 and `v` is even, it processes the array to split it into segments where the `i`-th bit is 0, and updates `t` and `a` accordingly.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, it continues to the next bit.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is even, it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit is 0 and updates `ans` with the maximum count.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is 0, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all bits, the function returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the main logic correctly processes the array to find the maximum number of segments that satisfy the given conditions.

However, there are a few potential issues to consider:
- The program assumes that the input is always valid, which is stated in the problem description.
- The logic for handling the bits and splitting the array seems complex but follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

Given the complexity and the specific nature of the problem, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.

**Correctness: True**
