Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29. The bit at position 29 of `x` (`u`) is 1, and the sum of the bits at position 29 of each element in `a` (`v`) is even (i.e., `v % 2 == 0`). Additionally, the value of `v` is non-zero.**
