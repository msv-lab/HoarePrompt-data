Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variables `op` and `ai` are both initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`) retain their initial values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
