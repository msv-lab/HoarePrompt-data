Output State: **The program does not return any value.** 

Explanation: The given code snippet is a `return` statement without any expression or variable specified. In Python, when a function reaches a `return` statement without any value, it immediately exits and returns `None`. However, since no explicit value is being returned, the output state simply indicates that no value is returned by the program.
