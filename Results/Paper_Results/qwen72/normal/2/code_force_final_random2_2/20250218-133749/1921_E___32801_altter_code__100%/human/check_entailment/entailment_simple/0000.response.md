### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tt`) and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values for `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if `x2` (Bob's row) is less than or equal to `x1` (Alice's row). If so, it prints "draw" because Bob cannot move up and Alice cannot move down, leading to a stalemate.
   - If `x2` is greater than `x1`, the program proceeds to check the parity of the difference between `x2` and `x1`:
     - **Odd Difference:**
       - If `y1` (Alice's column) equals `y2` (Bob's column), Alice wins because she can move directly to Bob's position.
       - If `y1` does not equal `y2`, the program simulates Alice's and Bob's moves to see if Alice can eventually win or if the game ends in a draw.
     - **Even Difference:**
       - If `y1` equals `y2`, Bob wins because he can move directly to Alice's position.
       - If `y1` does not equal `y2`, the program simulates Alice's and Bob's moves to see if Bob can eventually win or if the game ends in a draw.

3. **Move Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the moves by adjusting the positions of Alice and Bob based on the rules of the game.
   - It checks if the positions lead to a win for either player or a draw.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where players cannot move beyond the board boundaries.
   - It ensures that the game ends in a draw if no player can force a win.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints. It handles all edge cases and simulates the moves accurately to determine the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

### Correctness:
**True**
