The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `r`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within a certain range, and each of the `t` test cases contains six integers. After executing the code, `r` will contain these six integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9, and either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b.**
