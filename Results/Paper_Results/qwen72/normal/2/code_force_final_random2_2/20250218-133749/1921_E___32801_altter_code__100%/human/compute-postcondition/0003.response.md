Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]` with specific constraints:
  - `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6`
  - `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9`
  - Either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`
- `n` is equal to `h`
- `m` is equal to `w`
- `x1` is equal to `x_a`
- `y1` is equal to `y_a`
- `x2` is equal to `x_b`
- `y2` is equal to `y_b`
- Additionally, `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('draw')
```

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'draw'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **draw**
