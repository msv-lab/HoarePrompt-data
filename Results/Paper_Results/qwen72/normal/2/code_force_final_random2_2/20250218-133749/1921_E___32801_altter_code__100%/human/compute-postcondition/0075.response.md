Output State: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9, and either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b. `n` is equal to `h`, `m` is equal to `w`, `x1` is equal to `x_a + a` (where `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1` or `w - y1` if `y2 < y1`), `y1` is equal to `m` (which is `w`), `x2` is equal to `x_b - a`, and `y2` is equal to `y_b + a`. `x2` is greater than `x1`. The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Furthermore, `y1` is greater than `y2`. `c` is equal to `m - y2`.** 

In natural language, the output state is: All the initial conditions remain unchanged. Additionally, the variable `c` is now set to the value of `m - y2`, where `m` is the width `w` and `y2` is the value of `y_b + a`.
