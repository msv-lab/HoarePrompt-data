### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` to process the input and determine the outcome.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads the input values for the board dimensions `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
   - The program checks several conditions to determine the outcome of the game.

3. **Conditions**:
   - **Initial Position Check**: If `x2 <= x1`, it means Bob's chip is already at or above Alice's chip, so the game ends in a draw.
   - **Odd Distance Check**: If the distance between the chips `(x2 - x1)` is odd, the program further checks:
     - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can win by moving directly to Bob's position.
     - If `y2 > y1`, Alice moves diagonally to the right; otherwise, she moves diagonally to the left.
     - The program then checks if Alice can force a win by moving to a position where Bob cannot avoid capture.
   - **Even Distance Check**: If the distance `(x2 - x1)` is even, the program checks:
     - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can win by moving directly to Alice's position.
     - If `y2 >= y1`, Bob moves diagonally to the right; otherwise, he moves diagonally to the left.
     - The program then checks if Bob can force a win by moving to a position where Alice cannot avoid capture.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the chips are at the boundaries of the board and ensures that moves do not go out of bounds.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the outcome of the game.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints. The conditions and checks are well-defined and cover all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
