You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` to process the input and determine the outcome.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads the input values for the board dimensions `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
   - The program checks several conditions to determine the outcome of the game.

3. **Conditions**:
   - **Initial Position Check**: If `x2 <= x1`, it means Bob's chip is already at or above Alice's chip, so the game ends in a draw.
   - **Odd Distance Check**: If the distance between the chips `(x2 - x1)` is odd, the program further checks:
     - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can win by moving directly to Bob's position.
     - If `y2 > y1`, Alice moves diagonally to the right; otherwise, she moves diagonally to the left.
     - The program then checks if Alice can force a win by moving to a position where Bob cannot avoid capture.
   - **Even Distance Check**: If the distance `(x2 - x1)` is even, the program checks:
     - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can win by moving directly to Alice's position.
     - If `y2 >= y1`, Bob moves diagonally to the right; otherwise, he moves diagonally to the left.
     - The program then checks if Bob can force a win by moving to a position where Alice cannot avoid capture.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the chips are at the boundaries of the board and ensures that moves do not go out of bounds.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the outcome of the game.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints. The conditions and checks are well-defined and cover all possible scenarios.
