To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]` where:
     - \(1 \leq x_a, x_b \leq h \leq 10^6\)
     - \(1 \leq y_a, y_b \leq w \leq 10^9\)
     - Either \(x_a \neq x_b\) or \(y_a \neq y_b\).
   - `n` is equal to `h`.
   - `m` is equal to `w`.
   - `x1` is equal to `x_a + a`, where `a` is:
     - `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`
     - `w - y1` if `y2 < y1`
   - `x2` is equal to `x_b - a`.
   - `y2` is equal to `y_b`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - If `y1 <= y2`, then `y1` is set to 1, and `c` is equal to `y2 - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `y1` is set to `m` (which is `w`), and `c` is equal to `m - y2`.
   - Additional conditions:
     - Either `b // 2 <= a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`, or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('draw')`.

Given the complexity of the initial state and the conditions, the print statement `print('draw')` will simply print the string `'draw'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **draw**
