The function `func_1` reads a single line of input containing six integers and processes these values to determine the outcome of a game scenario. It prints one of three possible outcomes: 'Alice', 'bob', or 'draw'. The function does not return any value. The input integers represent dimensions and coordinates, and the function logic is designed to evaluate specific conditions based on these inputs to decide the game result.
