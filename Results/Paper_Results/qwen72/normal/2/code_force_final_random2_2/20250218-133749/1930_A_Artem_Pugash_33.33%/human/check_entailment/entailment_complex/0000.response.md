Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem statement.

2. **Reading Integers**: For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`numInteger`) and the list of integers (`numbers`). However, there is a minor issue here: the integers are read as strings and need to be converted to integers before sorting and processing.

3. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. Sorting is necessary to ensure that we always pick the smallest possible value when forming pairs, which maximizes the score.

4. **Processing Pairs**: The function uses a `while` loop to process pairs of integers. It pops the first two elements from the sorted list, converts them to integers, and adds the minimum of the two to the running sum (`suma`). This approach ensures that we are always adding the smallest available number from the remaining list, which is optimal for maximizing the score.

5. **Output**: After processing all pairs, the function prints the sum for the current test case. This is done for each test case, and the function correctly handles multiple test cases.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function should handle edge cases such as the smallest possible input (e.g., `n = 1` with two integers) and the largest possible input (e.g., `n = 50` with 100 integers). The current implementation appears to handle these cases correctly.

However, there is a small issue in the code that needs to be addressed:

- **Type Conversion**: The list of integers is read as a list of strings using `input().split()`. These strings need to be converted to integers before sorting and processing. The current implementation converts the integers inside the `while` loop, which is inefficient and unnecessary. It would be better to convert them immediately after reading.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        numbers.sort()
        
        suma = 0
        
        while numbers:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        
        print(suma)
```

With this correction, the function should work correctly and efficiently.

Correctness: **True** (after the correction mentioned above)
