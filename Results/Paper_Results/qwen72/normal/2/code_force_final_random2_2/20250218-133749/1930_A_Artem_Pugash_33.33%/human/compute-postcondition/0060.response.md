The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but based on the context, it is expected to process a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the list contains `2n` integers, each within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

The function's output is not specified in the prompt, so I will assume it returns some result based on the processing of these inputs. However, without further details on the expected output, I will describe the function's input parameters and leave the output description general.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `2n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The function is expected to handle up to 5000 test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000). The specific output for each test case is not defined in the given context.**
