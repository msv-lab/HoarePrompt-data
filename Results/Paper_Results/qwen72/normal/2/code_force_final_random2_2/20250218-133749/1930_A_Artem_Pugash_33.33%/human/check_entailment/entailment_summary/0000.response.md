Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that when we take pairs of integers, the smaller integer in each pair is always the first element of the pair.
3. **Pair Selection and Sum Calculation**: The program repeatedly removes the smallest two elements from the sorted list, adds the smaller of the two to the running sum, and continues this process until the list is empty. This approach guarantees that we are always adding the smallest possible value from the remaining elements, which maximizes the score.
4. **Output**: The program prints the final score for each test case, which is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
