The value of `b` is updated to the integer value of the first element that was removed from the `numbers` list. Since `a` was previously set to the integer value of the first element removed from `numbers`, and now `b` is also set to the integer value of the first element removed from `numbers`, both `a` and `b` will have the same value. The `numbers` list now has six fewer elements compared to its original state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 2 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order and contains at least one element (but now has six fewer elements), `suma` is `2 * min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`.**
