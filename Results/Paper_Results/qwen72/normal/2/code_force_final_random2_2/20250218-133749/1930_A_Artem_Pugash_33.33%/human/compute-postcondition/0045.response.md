The only object in the loop head is the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute at least once, `numbers` must not be an empty list. The current state indicates that `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order, but it does not explicitly state whether this list is non-empty.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state of `numbers` to guarantee it is non-empty. Therefore, we need to specify that `numbers` contains at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 2 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order and contains at least one element, `suma` is 0**
