Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000.
- `i` is 0.
- `numInteger` is an input integer.
- `numbers` is an empty list.
- `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.

Given that `numbers` is an empty list, there are no pairs of integers to remove from it. Therefore, the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` is 0.

Thus, when the `print(suma)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `suma`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
