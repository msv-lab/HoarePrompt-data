Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order and contains at least zero elements (with the first element removed), `suma` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning this value to `b`.
- The variable `a` was previously assigned the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, and since `b` is now assigned the same value, both `a` and `b` hold the same integer value.
- The list `numbers` now has one less element, and it remains sorted in ascending order.
- All other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `suma`) remain unchanged.
