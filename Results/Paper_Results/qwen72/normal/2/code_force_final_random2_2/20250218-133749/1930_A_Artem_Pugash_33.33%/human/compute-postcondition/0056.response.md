Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 2 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order and contains at least one element (but now has six fewer elements), `suma` is `2 * min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `suma` is `2 * min(a, b)`.
- The code snippet `suma += min(a, b)` adds `min(a, b)` to the current value of `suma`.
- Therefore, the new value of `suma` is `2 * min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, which simplifies to `3 * min(a, b)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `numbers`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
