You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a and b are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is `t`, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user. The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and for each iteration, if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` was even, "Bob" was printed; otherwise, "Alice" was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution, and the final state is that `t` lines have been printed, each line containing either "Bob" or "Alice" based on the condition evaluated for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution incorrectly determines the winner based solely on whether the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. This approach fails to consider the optimal strategy that both players would employ during the game. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
1
3 1
```

According to the provided program:
- \(a = 3\)
- \(b = 1\)
- \(|a - b| = |3 - 1| = 2\), which is even.
- Therefore, the program outputs "Bob".

However, let's analyze the game step-by-step:
1. Alice starts with 3 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
2. Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 3 coins.
3. Bob now has 3 coins and must remove 1 coin, leaving him with 2 coins.
4. Alice has 1 coin and must remove 1 coin, leaving her with 0 coins.
5. Bob now has 2 coins and must remove 1 coin, leaving him with 1 coin.
6. Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty.

Thus, Alice wins the game, but the program incorrectly outputs "Bob".

This shows that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and therefore is incorrect.
