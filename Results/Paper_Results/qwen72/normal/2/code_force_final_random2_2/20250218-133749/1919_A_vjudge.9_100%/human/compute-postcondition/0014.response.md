Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition is met. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the absolute difference between `a` and `b` being even or odd is still valid based on the new values of `a` and `b`.
