Reasoning: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's re-evaluate the problem and the solution step by step, using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game is essentially about parity (even or odd). The key observation is that the difference in the number of coins between Alice and Bob's wallets determines the outcome.
   - If the difference \( |a - b| \) is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the difference \( |a - b| \) is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \( a \) and \( b \) in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It checks if the absolute difference \( |a - b| \) is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Verification Using Annotations**:
   - The initial state of the program is correctly described: \( t \) is an integer where \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \), and for each test case, \( a \) and \( b \) are integers where \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9 \).
   - The program correctly reads the inputs and processes each test case.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of \( |a - b| \) is implemented correctly.
   - The final state of the program is as described: after processing all \( t \) test cases, the program prints the correct result for each test case.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic aligns with the key insight derived from the problem statement.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem.
   - The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected at each step.

Given the above reasoning and verification, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
