The code snippet `a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the user input, splits the input by spaces, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `i` is 1
- `a` and `b` are integers input by the user
- If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition is met. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.

After executing the code snippet, the new values of `a` and `b` are determined by the user input. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition is met. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.**
