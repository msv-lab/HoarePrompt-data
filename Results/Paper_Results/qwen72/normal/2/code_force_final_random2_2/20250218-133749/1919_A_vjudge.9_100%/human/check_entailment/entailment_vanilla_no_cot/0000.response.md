Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The logic behind the solution is that if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Bob will win; otherwise, Alice will win. This is because the game essentially boils down to a parity game where the player who starts with the odd difference in coins will always be able to force a win by maintaining the parity advantage through the game's rules. The solution efficiently handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
