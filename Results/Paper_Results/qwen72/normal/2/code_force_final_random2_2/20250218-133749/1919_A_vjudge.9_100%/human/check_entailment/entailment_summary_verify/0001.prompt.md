You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000

Output

    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution, and the final state is that `t` lines have been printed, each line containing either "Bob" or "Alice" based on the condition evaluated for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the solution step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game is essentially about parity (even or odd). The key observation is that the difference in the number of coins between Alice and Bob's wallets determines the outcome.
   - If the difference \( |a - b| \) is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the difference \( |a - b| \) is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \( a \) and \( b \) in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It checks if the absolute difference \( |a - b| \) is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic implemented in the program matches the key insight derived from the problem statement.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.
