The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition is met. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.**
