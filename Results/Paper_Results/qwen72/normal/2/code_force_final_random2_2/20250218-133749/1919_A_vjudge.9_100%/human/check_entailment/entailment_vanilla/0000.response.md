Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the solution step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game is essentially about parity (even or odd). The key observation is that the difference in the number of coins between Alice and Bob's wallets determines the outcome.
   - If the difference \( |a - b| \) is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the difference \( |a - b| \) is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \( a \) and \( b \) in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It checks if the absolute difference \( |a - b| \) is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic implemented in the program matches the key insight derived from the problem statement.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
