Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers input by the user.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This code simply prints the string `'Alice'`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **Alice**
