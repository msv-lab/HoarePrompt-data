Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is `T + 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is the product of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` after they have been updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of the elements `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]` if `sumo` is less than `prod`. Additionally, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
