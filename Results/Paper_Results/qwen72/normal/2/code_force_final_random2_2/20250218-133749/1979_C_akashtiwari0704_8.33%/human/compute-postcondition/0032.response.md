Output State: **`ans` is the string representation of `a[bets - 1]` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of `a[i - 1]` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` for 0 ≤ i < bets is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`, `i` is `bets`, and `sumo` is the sum of the new values of `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
