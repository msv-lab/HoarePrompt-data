Output State: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is `T + 1` (or `T + 2` relative to the initial state before the last iteration), `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is 0, and `ans` remains a string containing the space-separated string representations of the elements `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]` if `sumo` is less than `prod`. Otherwise, if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is now a string containing all elements of `a` from the first to the `bets`-th element, each followed by a space.**
