Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in its approach to solving the problem. Specifically, the program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to determine the bets. This approach does not ensure that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
3 2 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
27 41 12
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation:**
- The program calculates `prod` as \(3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42\).
- It then sets the bets as \(a[0] = 42 / 3 = 14\), \(a[1] = 42 / 2 = 21\), and \(a[2] = 42 / 7 = 6\).
- The sum of the bets is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\).
- The program checks if \(41 \geq 42\) and prints `-1` because the condition is true.

However, a valid solution exists where the bets are \(27, 41, 12\), and the total sum of bets is \(27 + 41 + 12 = 80\). For each winning outcome:
- If the first outcome wins, you get \(3 \times 27 = 81\) coins.
- If the second outcome wins, you get \(2 \times 41 = 82\) coins.
- If the third outcome wins, you get \(7 \times 12 = 84\) coins.

All these values are strictly greater than 80, which satisfies the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to find a valid solution in this case.
