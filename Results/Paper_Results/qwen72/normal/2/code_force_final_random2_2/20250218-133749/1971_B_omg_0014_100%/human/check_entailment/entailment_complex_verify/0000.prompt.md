You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `i` is `n-1`, and for each iteration, `s` was a string input by the user. For each `s`, `a` was a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` was 1, the program printed 'NO'. If the length of `a` was greater than 1, the program printed 'YES', and then it printed either the sorted version of `s` in ascending order or in descending order, depending on whether `s` was already sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= n <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It checks if all characters in `s` are the same. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest permutation of `s`, depending on whether `s` is already in ascending order. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state reflects the number of test cases processed and the output printed for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for generating a different string `r` from `s` is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Single Character Case**: The program correctly identifies that if all characters are the same, it is impossible to rearrange the string to a different one (`len(a) == 1`).

2. **Sorting Logic**: The program sorts the string `s` and checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`. If they are equal, it prints the reverse sorted string `c`. This approach is problematic because it does not guarantee that the generated string `r` is different from `s`.

   - **Example Failure Case**: Consider the input `s = "abac"`.
     - Sorted string `b` is `"aabc"`.
     - Reverse sorted string `c` is `"cbaa"`.
     - The program will print `"cbaa"`, which is different from `"abac"`, but this is not always the case.

3. **General Case**: The program does not ensure that the generated string `r` is different from `s` in all cases. For example, if `s = "abcd"`, both `b` and `c` will be different from `s`, but the program does not check if `b` is already different from `s` before printing `c`.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if the generated string `r` is different from `s` and handle cases where the sorted or reverse sorted string might still be equal to `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            if b != s:
                print(b)
            else:
                # Generate a different string by swapping the first two characters
                r = list(s)
                r[0], r[1] = r[1], r[0]
                print(''.join(r))

func()
```

This version ensures that the generated string `r` is always different from `s` by swapping the first two characters if the sorted string `b` is equal to `s`.
