You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `i` is `n-1`, and for each iteration, `s` was a string input by the user. For each `s`, `a` was a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` was 1, the program printed 'NO'. If the length of `a` was greater than 1, the program printed 'YES', and then it printed either the sorted version of `s` in ascending order or in descending order, depending on whether `s` was already sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= n <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It checks if all characters in `s` are the same. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest permutation of `s`, depending on whether `s` is already in ascending order. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state reflects the number of test cases processed and the output printed for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually by reading the string `s`.

2. **Single Character Check**: The program checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string to a set `a`. If the length of the set is 1, it means all characters are the same, and the program prints "NO" because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.

3. **Rearrangement Logic**:
   - The program sorts the string `s` to get `b` and sorts it in reverse order to get `c`.
   - It then checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`.
     - If `b` is equal to `s`, it means sorting the string in ascending order does not change it, so the program prints the reverse sorted string `c` to ensure the result is different from `s`.
     - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it means sorting the string in ascending order already produces a different string, so the program prints `b`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs "YES" followed by the rearranged string if a valid rearrangement is possible, and "NO" if it is not.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement. It ensures that the output string is different from the input string when possible and reports "NO" when it is not possible to rearrange the string to form a different one.
