To determine what will be printed by the `print(b)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `s` is a new string input by the user.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new `s`.

2. **Conditions and Variables:**
   - If the length of `a` is 1, the length of `a` remains 1.
   - If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `b` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in ascending order.
   - `c` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in descending order.
   - If `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` is sorted in ascending order; otherwise, `s` is not sorted in ascending order.

3. **Determine the Value of `b`:**
   - The value of `b` is determined by sorting the characters of the string `s` in ascending order.
   - This means that regardless of the initial state of `s`, `b` will always be the string `s` with its characters sorted in ascending order.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(b)` statement will print the string `s` with its characters sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **b (where b is the string s with its characters sorted in ascending order)**
