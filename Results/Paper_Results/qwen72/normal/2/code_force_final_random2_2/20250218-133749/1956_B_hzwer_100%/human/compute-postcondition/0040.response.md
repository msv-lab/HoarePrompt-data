Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input that has been fully iterated.
- `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`.
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - Each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]` and `n = 3`, then `cnt` would be `[0, 2, 2, 1]` because:
     - `cnt[0]` is 0 (no 0s in `a`).
     - `cnt[1]` is 2 (two 1s in `a`).
     - `cnt[2]` is 2 (two 2s in `a`).
     - `cnt[3]` is 1 (one 3 in `a`).

2. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.
   - This means for each element `x` in `cnt`, we take the maximum of 0 and `x - 1`, and then sum these values.
   - For the example `cnt = [0, 2, 2, 1]`:
     - `max(0, 0 - 1) = 0`
     - `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1`
     - `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1`
     - `max(0, 1 - 1) = 0`
     - Summing these values gives `0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all elements x in cnt)**

This output provides a precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
