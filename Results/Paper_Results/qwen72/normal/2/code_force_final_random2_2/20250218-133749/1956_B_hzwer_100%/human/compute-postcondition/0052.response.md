Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is 0.** 

Explanation: The variable `ans` is set to 0, overriding its previous value which was the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
