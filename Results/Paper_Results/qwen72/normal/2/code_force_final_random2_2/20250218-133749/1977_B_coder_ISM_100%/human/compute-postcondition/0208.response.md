Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1 or 0. If `s[0]` is `'1'` and `s[1]` is `'1'`, then `s[0]` is set to `'-1'`, and `s[1]` remains `'1'` if `flag` was not 1, or `s[1]` is set to `'0'` if `flag` was 1. In all other cases, `s[0]` remains `'0'`. `flag` is always set to 0 regardless of the initial value of `flag`.***
