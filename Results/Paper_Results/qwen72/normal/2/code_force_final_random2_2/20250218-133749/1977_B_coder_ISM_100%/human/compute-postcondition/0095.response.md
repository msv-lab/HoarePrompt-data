Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer. If the bitwise AND of `x` and `2^i` (which is 2) is non-zero, `s` is `['1', '0']`. Otherwise, `s` is `['0', '0']`.**

Explanation: The code appends `'0'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` could be either `['1']` or `['0']` depending on the condition involving `x` and `2^i`. After appending `'0'`, `s` becomes `['1', '0']` if the bitwise AND of `x` and `2` is non-zero, or `['0', '0']` otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
