The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than 30. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, and `x` is an input integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be less than 30.

State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer. If the bitwise AND of `x` and `2^i` (which is 2) is non-zero, `s` is `['1']`. Otherwise, `s` is `['0']`.**
