Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *After the loop executes all 29 iterations, `i` is 28, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. The final state of `s` will depend on the initial values of `s` and the transitions made during the loop. Specifically, any consecutive `'1'` pairs will be transformed into `'-1'` followed by `'0'` (or vice versa) until no more such pairs exist, and any `'0'` encountered when `flag` is 1 will be left unchanged. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'0'`, the 30th element of `s` is now `'1'`. If `flag` is 0, or if `flag` is 1 but `s[29]` is not `'0'`, the `flag` remains 0 and the list `s` contains 30 strings as described.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. If the second element of `s` (i.e., `s[1]`) is `'-1'` and the first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is `'1'`, then the second element of `s` is updated to `'0'` and the first element remains `'-1'`. Otherwise, the elements of `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. If the second element of `s` (i.e., `s[1]`) is `'-1'` and the first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is `'1'`, then the second element of `s` is updated to `'0'` and the first element remains `'1'`. Otherwise, the elements of `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. If the third element of `s` (i.e., `s[2]`) is `'-1'` and the second element of `s` (i.e., `s[1]`) is `'1'`, then the third element of `s` is updated to `'0'` and the second element remains `'1'`. Otherwise, the elements of `s` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
