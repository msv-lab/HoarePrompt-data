The code snippet `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Based on the initial conditions, `s` is either `['1', '1']` or `['0', '0']` depending on the value of `x`.

- If the bitwise AND of `x` and `4` (which is `2^i`) is non-zero, `s` is `['1', '1']`.
- Otherwise, `s` is `['0', '0']`.

After appending `'1'` to `s`, the new value of `s` will be:

- If `s` was `['1', '1']`, it becomes `['1', '1', '1']`.
- If `s` was `['0', '0']`, it becomes `['0', '0', '1']`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is either `['1', '1', '1']` or `['0', '0', '1']` depending on the value of `x`.**
