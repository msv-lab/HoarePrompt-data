Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements. The list `s` will have been modified according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, any consecutive '1's in `s` will have been replaced with '-1' followed by '0', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is set will have been flipped to '1'. The final value of `flag` will depend on whether the last operation in the loop set it to 1 or left it as 0. Additionally, either `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'.**
