Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the bit at position `i` (which is 0) in `x` is set to 1 or 0, and `flag` is either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions described in the initial state.***
