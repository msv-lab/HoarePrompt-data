You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 30
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        flag = 0
        for i in range(0, 29):
            if flag and s[i] == '0':
                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of positive integers `x` (where 1 ≤ x < 2^30) from user input, processes each integer to transform its binary representation according to specific rules, and prints the transformed binary string along with its length. The transformation involves replacing consecutive '1's with '-1' followed by '0', and handling carry-over operations when necessary. After processing all inputs, the function does not return any value but outputs the transformed binary strings and their lengths.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description for every potential case. Here are a few specific issues:

1. **Handling of Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**: The program attempts to handle consecutive non-zero elements by setting flags and adjusting values, but it does not always ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero. For example, consider the input `x = 14`. The binary representation of 14 is `1110`, and the program should convert this to a valid array like `[0, -1, 0, 0, 1]`. However, the program might produce an invalid array like `[0, -1, 1, 0]`, which violates the condition that no two consecutive elements can be non-zero.

2. **Adjustment Logic**: The adjustment logic in the program is complex and may not cover all edge cases. For instance, the logic for adjusting the array when a flag is set might not always result in a valid array. Consider the input `x = 24`. The binary representation of 24 is `11000`, and the program should convert this to a valid array like `[0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1]`. However, the program might produce an invalid array like `[0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0]`.

3. **Length Calculation**: The program calculates the length of the array as 30, which is fixed. This might not always be the optimal length for the array. For example, for `x = 1`, the optimal length is 1, but the program will always output an array of length 30.

4. **Final Adjustment**: The final adjustment loop that checks for `-1` followed by `1` and sets them to `0` and `-1` respectively might not handle all cases correctly. For example, if the array has multiple such pairs, it might not adjust them all correctly.

To ensure the program is correct, it needs to be thoroughly tested with various inputs and edge cases, and the logic for handling consecutive non-zero elements and adjusting the array needs to be more robust.
