Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0' and the rest correspond to the binary representation of `x`, and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0, `s` contains 30 elements corresponding to the binary representation of `x`, and `flag` remains 0. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
