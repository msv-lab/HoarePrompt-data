Output State: **After the loop has executed all 30 iterations, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer. The list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit first.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates 30 times, from `i = 0` to `i = 29`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` (starting from the least significant bit) is set (i.e., if `x & pow(2, i)` is non-zero).
- If the bit is set, it appends '1' to the list `s`.
- If the bit is not set, it appends '0' to the list `s`.
- After 30 iterations, `s` will contain 30 elements, each representing a bit of `x` in reverse order (from least significant to most significant).
