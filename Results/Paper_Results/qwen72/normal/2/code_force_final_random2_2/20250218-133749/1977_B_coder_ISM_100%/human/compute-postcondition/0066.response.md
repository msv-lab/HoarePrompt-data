Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 or 31 depending on whether `flag` was set or not, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements. The list `s` has been modified such that any consecutive '1's have been replaced with '-1' followed by '0', and any '0's encountered while `flag` was set have been flipped to '1'. If `flag` is set and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is flipped to '1', `length` is 31, and `s` contains 31 elements with the last element being '1'. If `flag` is not set or `s[29]` is not '0', then `length` is 30, and `s` contains 30 elements.***
