Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `odds`, `prev` is now equal to the first element of `odds`, `idx` is `idx - 1`, `a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.
- `x` remains the second element of `odds`.
- `prev` remains the first element of `odds`.
- `idx` is still `idx - 1`.
- The list `odds` remains unchanged and must have at least two elements.
