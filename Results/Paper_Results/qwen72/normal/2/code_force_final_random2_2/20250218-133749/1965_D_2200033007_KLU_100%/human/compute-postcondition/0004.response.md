Output State: **`bigList` is now a list of integers with its last two elements removed, `smallList` is now a list with its last element removed, and every element in `smallList` is still in `bigList`. Both lists are non-empty, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` were equal before the last element of `bigList` was removed.**
