    #The program returns `cts`, which is a sorted list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the palindrome array `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers representing a palindrome array and returns a sorted list of all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index to the end of the array. The original list `a` remains unchanged.

    #The program returns an empty list, as `odds` is a list containing elements from `cts` that do not have a matching pair, but `cts` is initially empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers and returns a new list `odds` containing the elements from `cts` that do not have a matching pair in the sequence. If `cts` is initially empty, the function returns an empty list.

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `odds` remains a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums. The variable `prev` is equal to the last element of `odds`. The variable `idx` is `0` or `-1` depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively. The list `a` is populated such that for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` was equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value of `x` from the list `odds`.
    return a
    #The program returns the list `a` which is populated based on the conditions described. Each element in `a` is either set to a value from the `odds` list or calculated as `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current value from `odds` and `prev` is the previous value from `odds`. The exact values in `a` depend on the values in `odds` and the parity of `n`. If `n` is even, `idx` is `0`, and if `n` is odd, `idx` is `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing the sums of subarrays at odd indices, and `n`, an integer representing the length of the original array `a` (where `n` is odd and 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000). It returns a list `a` of length `n`, where each element is either directly set to a value from `odds` or calculated as `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current value from `odds` and `prev` is the previous value from `odds`. The elements of `a` are populated such that for each `x` in `odds`, if the index `idx` is equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The final state of the program is that `odds` remains unchanged, `prev` is equal to the last element of `odds`, and `idx` is `-1`.

    #State: `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal, or one of the lists is empty. Every element in `smallList` is still in `bigList`, but the last elements that were equal have been removed.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and is not equal to the last element of `smallList` (if `smallList` is not empty).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, which are non-empty lists of integers, with every element in `smallList` also present in `bigList`. It modifies both lists by removing the last elements that are equal until either the last elements are no longer equal or one of the lists becomes empty. The function returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and is not equal to the last element of `smallList` (if `smallList` is not empty). If `smallList` becomes empty, the function returns the last element of `bigList`.
