Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` remains a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array with at least one element, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from the second element to the last element, `i` is 2, `sm` is 0, and `j` is the last index of `a`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i, len(a)):
    sm = sm + a[j]
    cts.append(sm)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array with at least three elements, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from the second element to the last element plus the value of `sm`, `i` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the initial `sm` (which was 0) and the last element of `a`, and `j` is the last index of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array with at least three elements, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from the second element to the last element plus the value of `sm`, and now includes the value of `sm` at the end, `i` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the initial `sm` (which was 0) and twice the last element of `a`, and `j` is the last index of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array with at least three elements, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from the second element to the last element plus the value of `sm`, and now includes the value of `sm` at the end, `i` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the initial `sm` (which was 0) and twice the last element of `a` plus the last element of `a`, `j` is `len(a)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
