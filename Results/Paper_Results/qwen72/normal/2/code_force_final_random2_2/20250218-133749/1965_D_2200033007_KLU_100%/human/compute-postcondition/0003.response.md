To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. `len(smallList) > 0`: This condition checks if `smallList` is not empty.
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`: This condition checks if the last elements of both `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `bigList` is now a list of integers with its last element removed.
- `smallList` is now a list with its last element removed.
- Every element in `smallList` is still in `bigList`.
- Both lists are non-empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
- `smallList` must still be non-empty.
- The last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` must be equal.

Since both lists had their last elements removed in the previous iteration, the new last elements of both lists must be equal for the loop to continue. Additionally, `smallList` must still have at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that:
- `smallList` is non-empty.
- The last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.

State: **`bigList` is now a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is now a list with its last element removed, and every element in `smallList` is still in `bigList`. Both lists are non-empty, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.**
