To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `cnt` is non-zero.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must still be non-zero. Therefore, `k` must be at least 2 (since `k - 1` must be at least 1).

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **`cnt`:**
  - Since `cnt` is `k - 1`, and `k` must be at least 2 for `cnt` to be non-zero, no adjustment is needed for `cnt` itself. We just need to ensure that `k` is at least 2.

- **`l`:**
  - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `func_2() + 1` must be less than `n + 1`.
  - This implies that `func_2()` must be less than `n`.

### Final State:

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is at least 2 and `func_2()` is less than `n`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1, `k` must be at least 2, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` is less than `n`**
