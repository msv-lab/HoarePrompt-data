Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and they have been updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. `v` is 1.** 

Explanation: The variable `v` is assigned the value 1. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged and are still positive integers within the specified range, having been updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
