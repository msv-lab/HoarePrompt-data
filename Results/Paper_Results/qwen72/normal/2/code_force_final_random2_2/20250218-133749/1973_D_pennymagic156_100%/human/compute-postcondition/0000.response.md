The code snippet `n, k = func_3()` assigns new values to `n` and `k` based on the return values from the function `func_3()`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, the new values of `n` and `k` must also satisfy these conditions. However, without knowing the specifics of `func_3()`, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k` after the assignment.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and they have been updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.**
