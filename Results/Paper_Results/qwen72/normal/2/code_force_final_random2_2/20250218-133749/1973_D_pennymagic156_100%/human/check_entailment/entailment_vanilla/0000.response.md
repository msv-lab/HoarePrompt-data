### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the same value of `f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) * max(a[l], ..., a[r])`.
   - We can make at most `2n` queries to find the smallest `r` for a given `l` and `x`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Possible Value:**
   - The program starts by trying to find the maximum possible value of `m` by querying the largest possible `x` values.
   - It iterates from `n` down to `1`, checking if there exists an `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`. If such an `r` exists and equals `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Checking Subarrays:**
   - The program then tries to split the array into `k` subarrays with the value `i * v`.
   - It uses a nested loop to check if it can find `k` subarrays where each subarray has the value `i * v`.
   - If it successfully finds `k` subarrays, it prints the answer `i * v` and returns.

5. **Handling No Valid Split:**
   - If no valid split is found, it prints `-1` and returns.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Querying the Maximum Possible Value:**
  - The program correctly queries the largest possible values of `x` to find the maximum possible `m`.
  - It ensures that the value `v` is set to the largest possible value that can be used to split the array.

- **Splitting the Array:**
  - The program attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays with the value `i * v`.
  - It correctly handles the case where no valid split is found by printing `-1`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `k = 1` by directly setting `m` to `f(1, n)`.

- **Interactive Constraints:**
  - The program ensures that it does not exceed the query limit of `2n` by carefully managing the number of queries.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It follows the constraints and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: **True****
