To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and expressions in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range` function. For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 1 and increment up to `n // k`.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable determines the upper limit of the range. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1.
3. **Variable `k`**: This variable is used in the division to determine the upper limit of the range. It must be a positive integer to avoid division by zero and to ensure the loop can execute.

Given these conditions, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `n // k` is at least 1, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1, `k` must be a positive integer**
