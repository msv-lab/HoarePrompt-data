Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and `cnt` is 0 and `l` is equal to `n + 1`.** 

This postcondition includes all the conditions from the precondition and additionally specifies that `cnt` is 0 and `l` is equal to `n + 1`, as required by the if condition. However, note that there is a contradiction between the precondition stating `l` is not equal to `n + 1` and the if condition requiring `l` to be equal to `n + 1`. This suggests that the if condition cannot be entered under the given precondition. Nonetheless, the postcondition reflects the logical state if the if condition were to be met.
