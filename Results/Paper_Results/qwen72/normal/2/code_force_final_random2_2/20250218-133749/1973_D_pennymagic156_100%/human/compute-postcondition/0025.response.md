Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1.
   - `k` must be a positive integer.
   - `cnt` is `k`.
   - `l` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

3. **Variable Analysis:**
   - `l` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since it is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can represent it symbolically as `v`.

4. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `f'? {l} {i * v}'`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `l` is 1.
     - `i` is 1.
     - Therefore, `i * v` is `1 * v`, which simplifies to `v`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `? 1 v`.

Output: **? 1 v (where v is the value of the variable v)**
