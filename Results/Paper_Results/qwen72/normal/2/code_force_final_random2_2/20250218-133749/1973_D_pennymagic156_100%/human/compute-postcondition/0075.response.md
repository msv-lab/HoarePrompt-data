The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Since `cnt` was initially `k - 2`, after the decrement, `cnt` becomes `k - 3`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer and greater than 2, `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
