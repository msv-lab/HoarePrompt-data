Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1` and `func_2()` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = func_2() + 1` reassigns the value of `l` to `func_2() + 1`.
- The initial state already mentions that `l` is `func_2() + 1`, so the value of `l` remains unchanged.
- All other conditions and variable values remain the same as they were in the initial state.
