Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 1.
2. `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1.
3. `k` must be at least 2.
4. `cnt` is `k - 1`.
5. `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` is less than `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Value of `l`:**
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`.
   - `func_2()` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `l` is some value between 1 and `n` (inclusive).

3. **Value of `v`:**
   - The value of `v` is not explicitly given in the initial state. Since it is used in the print statement, we need to assume it is defined elsewhere in the code. For the purpose of this task, we will denote it as `v`.

4. **Value of `i * v`:**
   - Since `i` is 1, `i * v` simplifies to `v`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a string formatted as `? {l} {v}`, where:
- `{l}` is the value of `l`, which is `func_2() + 1` and is between 1 and `n`.
- `{v}` is the value of `v`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [l] [v] (where [l] is the value of `func_2() + 1` and [v] is the value of `v`)**
