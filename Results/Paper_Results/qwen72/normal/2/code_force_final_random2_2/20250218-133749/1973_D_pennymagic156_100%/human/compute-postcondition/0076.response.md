Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: Remains 3, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The condition that `n // k` is at least 3 remains unchanged, as `n` is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: Must still be a positive integer, and it must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- **`cnt`**: Initially `k`, it is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs. After all iterations, `cnt` will be 0.
- **`l`**: After each iteration, `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`. The exact value of `l` depends on the return value of `func_2()`, but it will always be `func_2() + 1` after the last iteration.
- **`l` is not equal to `n + 1`**: This condition must hold true for the loop to continue executing, so it remains unchanged.
- **`func_2()` must be less than `n`**: This condition must also hold true for the loop to continue executing, so it remains unchanged.
- **Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**: This condition ensures that the loop continues to run. After all iterations, `cnt` will be 0, but `l` must still not be equal to `n + 1` for the loop to have completed all iterations.
