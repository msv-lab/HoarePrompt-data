Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `v` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n`.** 

Explanation: The value of `v` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is currently `n`. Since `v` was already equal to `n`, the assignment does not change its value. The conditions and values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
