Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is updated to the value of `k`.
- `l` is updated to 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
