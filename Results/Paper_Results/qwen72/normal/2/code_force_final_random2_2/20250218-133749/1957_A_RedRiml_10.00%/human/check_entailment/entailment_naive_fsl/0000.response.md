Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple polygons can be formed from the same stick length. For example, consider the input where `n = 6` and the stick lengths are `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. According to the problem description, we can form two triangles (each using three sticks of length 2), but the program will only count this as one polygon because it increments the `shapes` counter by 1 whenever there are at least 3 sticks of the same length. This results in an incorrect output of 1 instead of the correct output of 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
