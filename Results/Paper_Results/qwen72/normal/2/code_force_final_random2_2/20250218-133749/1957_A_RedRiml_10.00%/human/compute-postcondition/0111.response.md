Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least one element, `shapes` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.** 

Explanation: The value of `shapes` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
