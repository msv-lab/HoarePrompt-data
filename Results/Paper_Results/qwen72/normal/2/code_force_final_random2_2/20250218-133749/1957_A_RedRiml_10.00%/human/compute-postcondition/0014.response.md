Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary where if `d` did not contain the key `i`, it now includes the key `i` with the value 1, and if `d` already contained the key `i`, the value associated with `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` was not in `pl` before the operation, it is now added to `pl`.***
