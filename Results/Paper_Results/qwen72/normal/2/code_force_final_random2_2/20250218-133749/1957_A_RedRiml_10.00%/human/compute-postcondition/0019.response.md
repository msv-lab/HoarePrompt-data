Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least two elements, `pl` is a list that contains the integer `i` (where `i` is the second element in `palka`), `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (which is the second element in `palka`) is either added with the value 1 if it was not present, or its value is incremented by 1 if it was already present.**
