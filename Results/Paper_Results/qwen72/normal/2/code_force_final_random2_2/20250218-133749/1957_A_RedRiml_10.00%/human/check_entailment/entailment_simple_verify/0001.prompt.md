You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

    #State: After all iterations of the loop have executed, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` is equal to the initial value of `w`, `_` is equal to `w`, `ln` is the last input integer read during the last iteration, `palka` is the last list of integers read during the last iteration, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the last `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the last `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from the last `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `shapes` is the number of unique integers in the last `palka` that appear 3 or more times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `w` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks `palka`.

2. **Frequency Count**: The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length. This is done correctly by iterating over the list `palka` and updating the dictionary `d`.

3. **Unique Stick Lengths**: The program maintains a list `pl` of unique stick lengths. This is not strictly necessary for the solution but does not affect the correctness.

4. **Shape Calculation**: The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl` and checks if the count of each length in the dictionary `d` is at least 3. If so, it increments the `shapes` counter. This logic is flawed because it only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, which is not sufficient to ensure that a regular polygon can be formed. For example, 3 sticks of length 1 can form a triangle, but 4 sticks of length 1 can form a square, and so on.

5. **Output**: The program prints the number of shapes for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program's logic for counting the number of shapes is incorrect. It only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, which is not enough to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
- To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the number of sides required for each possible polygon (e.g., 3 for a triangle, 4 for a square, etc.) and calculate the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed from the available sticks.

### Corrected Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Count the frequency of each stick length.
2. For each unique stick length, determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using the formula `count // sides` where `sides` is the number of sides of the polygon (starting from 3 and going up to the number of sticks available).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        
        shapes = 0
        for length, count in d.items():
            for sides in range(3, count + 1):
                shapes += count // sides
                count %= sides
        
        print(shapes)

func()
```
