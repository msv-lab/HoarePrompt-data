To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in pl:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the variable `j` iterates over the elements in the list `pl`. For the loop to execute, `pl` must contain at least one element. The other variables mentioned in the state (`palka`, `d`, `shapes`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, and `_`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `pl`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `pl` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one element).
3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `pl` is not empty. The initial state mentions that `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared. Therefore, `pl` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `palka` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.
- `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and it must have at least one element.
- `shapes` is 0.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
- `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`.
- `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`.
- `ln` is an input integer.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least one element, `shapes` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer.**
