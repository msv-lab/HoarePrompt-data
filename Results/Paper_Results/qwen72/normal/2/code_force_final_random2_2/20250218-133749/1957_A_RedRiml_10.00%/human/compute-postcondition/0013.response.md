The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the integer `i` to the list `pl`. Since `pl` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `pl` will contain the single element `i`.

The dictionary `d` is also updated based on the presence of the key `i`. If `i` was not already a key in `d`, it is added with a value of 1. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `palka`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `pl` is a list containing the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary where if `d` did not contain the key `i`, it now includes the key `i` with the value 1, and if `d` already contained the key `i`, the value associated with `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `i` is not in the list `pl` before this operation.**
