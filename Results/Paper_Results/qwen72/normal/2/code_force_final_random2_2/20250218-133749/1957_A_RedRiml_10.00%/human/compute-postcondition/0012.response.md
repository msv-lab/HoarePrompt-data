Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d` does not contain the key `i`, then `d` is updated to include the key `i` with the value 1. If `d` already contains the key `i`, then the value associated with `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `i` is not in the list `pl`.**
