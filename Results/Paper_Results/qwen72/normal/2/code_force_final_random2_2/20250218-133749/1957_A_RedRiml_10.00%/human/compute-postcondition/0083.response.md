Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` contains each unique element from `palka` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` whose count in `d` is 3 or more, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `palka`.
- The initial state variables `d`, `pl`, `shapes`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, and `ln` remain unchanged except for `_` which is incremented by 1.
- The condition `w` must be greater than the new value of `_` is still valid.
- The value of `ln` is still an input integer.
