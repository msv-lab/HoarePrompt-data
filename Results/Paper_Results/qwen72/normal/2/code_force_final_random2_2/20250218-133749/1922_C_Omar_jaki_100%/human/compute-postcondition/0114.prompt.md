Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and queries is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. A lambda function `r` is defined to read space-separated integers from input.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` remains a list with at least 6 elements starting with `[-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0]`, `v` is `2000000000.0`, `b` is extended by the elements `b[-2] + 2000000000.0` and `b[-1] + 2000000000.0` for each iteration of the loop, `u` is now zero (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()` during the last iteration. If `c` is less than `d`, the condition `c < d` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `c >= d` holds true.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The list `a` has 4 elements, `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `u` is `0`, `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()`, `x` is the final value of `c`, `y` is the final value of `d`, `v` is `d - c` (with the final values of `d` and `c`), `b` is extended by the total number of new elements added during all iterations, each pair being `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the values of `d` and `c` from each iteration). If the final `c` is less than the final `d`, `c` remains less than `d`. If the final `c` is greater than or equal to the final `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list with at least 7 elements: the first element is `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least five elements returned by `r()`, and the last element is `2000000000.0`. `w` is the fourth element of `a`. `x` is the fifth element of `a`. `y` is the sixth element of `a`. `z` is the seventh element of `a`. `u` is 0. `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()`. `v` is `y - x`. `b` is `[0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v]`. `t` is `False`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
