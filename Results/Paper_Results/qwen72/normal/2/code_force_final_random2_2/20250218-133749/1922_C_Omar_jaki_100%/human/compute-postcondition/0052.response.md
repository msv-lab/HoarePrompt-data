Initial State: The list `a` has at least 6 elements, `w` is the 3rd element of `a`, `x` is the 4th element of `a`, `y` is the 5th element of `a`, `z` is the 6th element of `a`, `v` is `y - x`, and `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (y - x)`.

Given Code:
```
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `w` = `a[2]`
   - `x` = `a[3]`
   - `y` = `a[4]`
   - `z` = `a[5]`
   - `v` = `y - x`
   - `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (y - x)`, `b[-1] + (y - x)`

2. **New Elements Added to `b`:**
   - `b[-2]` is the second-to-last element of `b`.
   - `b[-1]` is the last element of `b`.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `1`.
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `1`.

3. **Calculations:**
   - First new element: `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
     - If `v > x - w`, the new element is `b[-2] + v`.
     - Otherwise, the new element is `b[-2] + 1`.
   - Second new element: `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`
     - If `v > z - y`, the new element is `b[-1] + v`.
     - Otherwise, the new element is `b[-1] + 1`.

4. **Updated List `b`:**
   - `b` is extended by the two new elements calculated above.

Output State: **The list `a` has at least 6 elements, `w` is the 3rd element of `a`, `x` is the 4th element of `a`, `y` is the 5th element of `a`, `z` is the 6th element of `a`, `v` is `y - x`, `b` is extended by four new elements: `b[-4] + (y - x)`, `b[-3] + (y - x)`, `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`, `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.**
