Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list with at least 7 elements:
  - The first element is `-1000000000.0`.
  - Followed by at least five elements returned by `r()`.
  - The last element is `2000000000.0`.
- `w` is the fourth element of `a`.
- `x` is the fifth element of `a`.
- `y` is the sixth element of `a`.
- `z` is the seventh element of `a`.
- `u` is a truthy value minus 1. Since a truthy value is typically 1, `u` is `1 - 1 = 0`.
- `c` and `d` are new values returned by `r()`.
- `v` is `y - x`.
- `b` is `[0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v]`.
- `t` is `False`.
- If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - `a = [-1000000000.0, r(), r(), r(), r(), r(), 2000000000.0]`
   - `w = a[3]` (fourth element)
   - `x = a[4]` (fifth element)
   - `y = a[5]` (sixth element)
   - `z = a[6]` (seventh element)

2. **Variable `v`**:
   - `v = y - x`

3. **List `b`**:
   - `b = [0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v]`

4. **Variables `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`, which means they are random values.

5. **Condition**:
   - If `c < d`, then `c` is less than `d`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

6. **Print Statement**:
   - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` needs to be evaluated.
   - `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` are indices into the list `b`.

### Possible Values:
- `c` and `d` are random values, so let's consider the possible indices:
  - If `c = 1`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 1`.
  - If `c = 2`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 3`.
  - If `c = 3`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 5`.
  - If `c = 4`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 7`.
  - If `c = 5`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 9`.

- Similarly for `d`:
  - If `d = 1`, then `d * 2 - 1 = 1`.
  - If `d = 2`, then `d * 2 - 1 = 3`.
  - If `d = 3`, then `d * 2 - 1 = 5`.
  - If `d = 4`, then `d * 2 - 1 = 7`.
  - If `d = 5`, then `d * 2 - 1 = 9`.

### Calculation:
- The values at these indices in `b` are:
  - `b[1] = 0`
  - `b[3] = 1`
  - `b[5] = 2`
  - `b[7] = 2 + v`
  - `b[9] = 2 + 2*v`

- The difference `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will depend on the specific values of `c` and `d`.

### Final Output:
Since `c` and `d` are random values, the exact numerical output cannot be determined without knowing their specific values. However, the output will be one of the differences between the values at the specified indices in `b`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are random values, and b is the list [0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v])**
