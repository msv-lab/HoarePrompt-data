Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is now a list with the first element `-1000000000.0`, followed by the elements returned by `r()`, and the last element `2000000000.0`. `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `u` is `0`, `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()`, `x` is the final value of `c`, `y` is the final value of `d`, `v` is `d - c` (with the final values of `d` and `c`), `b` is `[0, 0]`, `t` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list with at least 4 elements: the first element is `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least two elements returned by `r()`, and the last element is `2000000000.0`. `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `u` is `0`, `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()`, `x` is the final value of `c`, `y` is the final value of `d`, `v` is `d - c` (with the final values of `d` and `c`), `b` is `[0, 0, v, 1]`, `t` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list with at least 5 elements: the first element is `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least three elements returned by `r()`, and the last element is `2000000000.0`. `w` is the second element of `a`. `x` is the third element of `a`. `y` is the fourth element of `a`. `z` is the fifth element of `a`. `u` is `0`. `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()`. `x` is the final value of `c`. `y` is the final value of `d`. `v` is `y - x`. `b` is `[0, 0, v, 1, 2v, 2]`. `t` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list with at least 6 elements: the first element is `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least four elements returned by `r()`, and the last element is `2000000000.0`. `w` is the third element of `a`. `x` is the fourth element of `a`. `y` is the fifth element of `a`. `z` is the sixth element of `a`. `u` is `0`. `c` is the final value of `x`. `d` is the final value of `y`. `v` is `y - x`. `b` is `[0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v]`. `t` is `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
