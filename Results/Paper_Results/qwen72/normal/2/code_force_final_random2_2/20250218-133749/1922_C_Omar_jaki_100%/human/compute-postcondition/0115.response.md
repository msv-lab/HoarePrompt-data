The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m`, along with a list of queries. Specifically, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9. The parameter `m` is an integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and `queries` is a list of `m` pairs (x_i, y_i), where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each query.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m`, along with a list of queries. It returns a result for each query, which involves processing the list `a` and the pairs (x_i, y_i) from the queries list.**
