Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The number of test cases `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32. Each test case consists of a string of length 5 containing only the characters 'A' and 'B'. All strings across the test cases are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    ac = 0
    bc = 0
    s = input()
    for i in s:
        if i == 'A':
            ac += 1
        else:
            bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the number of 'A' characters (`ac`) is greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`bc`). Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string input by the user. After the loop completes, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the condition `ac > bc` holds true. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, `q` is 2, `s` is a new string input by the user, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in `s`. If the number of 'A' characters (`ac`) is greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`bc`), the condition `ac > bc` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `ac <= bc` holds true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
