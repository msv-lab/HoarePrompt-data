Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string input by the user. After the loop completes, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in `s`. The current value of `ac` is greater than the current value of `bc`.**
