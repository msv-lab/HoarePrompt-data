Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `x` is 50000, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50000), then `L` is 50000 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50000.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `x` is 75000 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50000), otherwise `x` is 25000, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is equal to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is 75000 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50000), otherwise `R` is 25000.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1`. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
