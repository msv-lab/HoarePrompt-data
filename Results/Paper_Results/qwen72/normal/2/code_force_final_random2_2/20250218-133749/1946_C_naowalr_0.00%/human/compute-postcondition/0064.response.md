To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while R - L > 1:
```

The loop will execute if the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1. Given the current state:

- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

We need to check if `R - L > 1` holds true with these values.

Let's calculate:
- `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`

Since 100000 is indeed greater than 1, the condition `R - L > 1` is satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

Thus, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is now 1, `R` is now 100001, and `numCuts` is now 0**
