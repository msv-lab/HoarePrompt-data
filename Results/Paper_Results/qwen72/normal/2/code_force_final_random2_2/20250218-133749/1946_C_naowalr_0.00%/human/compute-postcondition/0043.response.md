Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `R - L > 1`. This means that the loop will terminate when `R - L` is either 0 or 1.
- During each iteration, the value of `x` is set to the midpoint between `L` and `R`.
- The variable `numCuts` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.
- The `dfs(1, 1)` function call returns a value `leftover` which is used to determine whether to update `L` or `R`.
- If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `x`.
- Otherwise, `R` is updated to `x`.
- The loop will continue to narrow down the range `[L, R]` until `R - L` is 1.
- At the end of the loop, `L` will be the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds, and `R` will be `L + 1`.
