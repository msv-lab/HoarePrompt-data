To determine what will be printed when the `print(L)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs.
   - `z` is 2.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
   - `numCuts` is 0.
   - `x` is `(L + R) // 2`.
   - `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.
   - `R - L` is 1 or less.
   - If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is the final value of `x`. Otherwise, `R` is the final value of `x`.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - The value of `x` is the midpoint of `L` and `R`.
   - The condition checks if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If the condition is true, `L` is updated to `x`.
   - If the condition is false, `R` is updated to `x`.
   - Since `R - L` is 1 or less, the final value of `L` or `R` will be very close to each other.

3. **Final Value of `L`:**
   - Given that `R - L` is 1 or less, the final value of `L` will be either the initial `L` or the updated `x` (which is the midpoint of `L` and `R`).

Since the exact values of `L` and `R` are not provided, we can only describe the final value of `L` based on the given conditions. The final value of `L` will be the value that satisfies the condition described above.

Output: **L (where L is the final value of L after the condition check and updates)**
