Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the adjacency list of a vertex in the tree.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, and `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L` is 1 or less. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is the final value of `x`. Otherwise, `R` is the final value of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
