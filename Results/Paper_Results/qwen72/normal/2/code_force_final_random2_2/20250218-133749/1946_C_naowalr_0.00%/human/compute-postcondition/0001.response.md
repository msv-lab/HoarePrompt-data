The only variable in the loop head is `z`, and the loop's execution depends on `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `z` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the `range(t)`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the adjacency list of a vertex in the tree, `z` is 0**
