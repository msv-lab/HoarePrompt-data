Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`, `z` is 1, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`.
- Before the code execution, `adj` was a list of `n + 1` empty lists.
- After the code execution, the list `adj[a]` contains the integer `b`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
