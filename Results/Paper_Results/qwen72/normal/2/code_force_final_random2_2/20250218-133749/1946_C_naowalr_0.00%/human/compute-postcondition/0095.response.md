The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` modifies the list `adj` by appending the value of `a` to the list located at index `b` in `adj`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `b`
- `z` is 2
- `i` is 0
- `a` and `b` are the next pair of integers read from the input
- `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`
- `R` is `L + 1`
- `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `a` is appended to the list `adj[b]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `b` and `adj[b]` now contains `a`, `z` is 2, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are the next pair of integers read from the input, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.**
