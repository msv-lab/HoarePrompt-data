To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` and `k` are specific integers read from the standard input such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.
- `z` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
- For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment up to `n - 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `n` is greater than 1.
- Initialize `i` to 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `z` is 0, `i` is 0**
