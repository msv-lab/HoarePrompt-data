### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a game played on a tree with \( n \) nodes.
   - The game is played over \( t \) rounds, but since \( t = 1 \), we only need to consider one round.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner for the given starting node.
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that checks if the current player can force a win from a given node.
   - `func_2` handles the input and calls `func_1` to determine the winner.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(nodes, start, parent)`**:
     - This function checks if the current player can force a win from the `start` node.
     - It returns `False` if the node is a leaf (no valid moves).
     - It recursively checks all children (neighbors) of the current node, excluding the parent.
     - It returns `True` if any child can be forced into a losing position (`not func_1(nodes, node, start)`).

   - **`func_2()`**:
     - Reads the input for \( n \) and \( t \).
     - Constructs the tree using adjacency lists.
     - Identifies all leaf nodes.
     - Determines the starting node and calls `func_1` to check if the first player (Ron) can force a win.
     - Prints "Ron" if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise prints "Hermione".

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly constructs the tree and identifies the starting node.
   - The recursive function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the current player can force a win.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
