Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the starting node for the game, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input.**

Explanation:
- The variables `u` and `v` are assigned the values from the user input, which are split and converted to integers.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, `edges`, `empty`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
