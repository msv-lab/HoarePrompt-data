Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of each node, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the starting node for the game, `edges` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list called `edges`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
