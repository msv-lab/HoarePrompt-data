The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This operation updates the values of `u` and `v` but does not affect the other variables. The values of `n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, `edges`, `empty`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` contains the list [v], `nodes[v]` contains the list [u]**.
