Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the starting node for the game, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.** 

Explanation: The code initializes `nodes` as a `defaultdict` with a default factory set to `list`. This means that if a key is accessed that does not exist in `nodes`, it will automatically create a new entry with an empty list as its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
