Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `u`, `nodes[v]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `v`, `leaves` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and must have at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `u`, `nodes[v]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `v`, `leaves` is a deque containing the first key from `nodes` if the list of connected nodes for `key` has exactly one element. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and must have at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `u`, `nodes[v]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `v`. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `leaves` is a deque containing the first key from `nodes` if the list of connected nodes for `key` has exactly one element, and now also contains `key`. `key` is the next key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and must have at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `u`, `nodes[v]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `v`. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `leaves` is a deque containing the first key from `nodes` and the next key in `nodes`. `key` is the next key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
