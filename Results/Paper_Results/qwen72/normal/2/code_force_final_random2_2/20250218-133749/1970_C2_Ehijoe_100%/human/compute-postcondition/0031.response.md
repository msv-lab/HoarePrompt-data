Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and must have at least one key-value pair, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `u`, `nodes[v]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `v`, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` where the list of connected nodes for each key has exactly one element, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, and `moves` is not empty (i.e., `moves` contains at least one element).**
