Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is now `n - 1`, `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string respectively. If `h` > 12, `h` is now `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.***
