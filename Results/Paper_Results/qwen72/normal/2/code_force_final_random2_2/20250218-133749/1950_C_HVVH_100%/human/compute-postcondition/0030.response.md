Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
   - `n` is now `n - 1`.
   - `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string `s` respectively.
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, `h` is set to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Extracting `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - The string `s` is in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the integer value of the first two characters of `s`.
   - `m` is the integer value of the last two characters of `s`.

2. **Adjusting `h` and Determining `day`:**
   - If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, set `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

3. **Formatting the Output:**
   - The `print` statement formats `h` and `m` to ensure they are always two digits (e.g., 05 instead of 5).
   - It then prints the formatted time followed by the value of `day`.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `s` is "14:30".

1. **Extracting `h` and `m`:**
   - `h = 14`
   - `m = 30`

2. **Adjusting `h` and Determining `day`:**
   - Since `h` is 14, which is greater than 12, set `h` to `14 - 12 = 2` and `day` to 'PM'.

3. **Formatting the Output:**
   - The formatted time is `02:30`.
   - The value of `day` is 'PM'.

### Final Output:
Output: **02:30 PM**

This format ensures that the output is clear and easily understandable, adhering to the given conditions and the format required.
