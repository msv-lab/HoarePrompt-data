Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` must be greater than 0, `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string respectively. If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM' and `h` is updated to `h - 12`. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.***
