The value of `h` is decremented by 12. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Since `h` and `m` represent the hour and minute from the input string respectively, and `h` is now `h - 12`, the new value of `h` is `h - 12`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is now `n`, `h` is `h - 12`, `m` is an integer representing the minute from the input string.**
