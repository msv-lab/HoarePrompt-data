Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format according to the problem description. It handles all edge cases, such as converting `00:00` to `12:00 AM`, `12:00` to `12:00 PM`, and adjusting the hour when it is greater than 12. The formatting of the output also matches the required format, including leading zeros for hours and minutes. Therefore, the program is correct.
