Reasoning:

1. The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format (`hh:mm`).
3. It correctly converts the hour part of the time to 12-hour format:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is exactly 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it keeps `h` as is and sets `day` to 'AM'.
4. It prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM/PM`.

The logic and flow of the program are correct and handle all edge cases as specified in the problem description. The program also ensures that the output format matches the required format.

Correctness: **True**
