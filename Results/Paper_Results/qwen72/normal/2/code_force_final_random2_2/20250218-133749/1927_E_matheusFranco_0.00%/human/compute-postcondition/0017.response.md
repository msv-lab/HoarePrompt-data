The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `curr_v` was 3, so the new value of `curr_v` is 4. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `permutation[0]` which is 1, `permutation[k]` which is 2, and `permutation[2 * k]` which is 3, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 4, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k` and `2 * k < n`.**
