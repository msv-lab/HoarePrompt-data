Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `2 < n` is true, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k]` is now `curr_v + 1`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is now `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. The updated value of `curr_v` is reflected in the permutation array at the specified indices.
