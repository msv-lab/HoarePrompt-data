To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and `k` is even.
- `n` is the first integer from input.
- `k` is the second integer from input.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- For every index `i` that is a multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1`.
- For every index `i` that is not a multiple of `k`, `permutation[i]` is set to the next available value of `curr_v` in the sequence.
- After the loop completes, `curr_v` is equal to `n + 1`.
- The loop variable `i` is equal to `k`.
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization of `permutation`**:
   - `permutation` is initialized as a list of length `n`.

2. **Setting Values for Multiples of `k`**:
   - For every index `i` that is a multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1`.
   - For example, if `k = 2` and `n = 6`, then:
     - `permutation[0] = 0 // 2 + 1 = 1`
     - `permutation[2] = 2 // 2 + 1 = 2`
     - `permutation[4] = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3`

3. **Setting Values for Non-Multiples of `k`**:
   - For every index `i` that is not a multiple of `k`, `permutation[i]` is set to the next available value of `curr_v` in the sequence.
   - `curr_v` starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each non-multiple of `k`.
   - Continuing the example with `k = 2` and `n = 6`:
     - `permutation[1] = curr_v = 4` (since `curr_v` starts at 4 after setting multiples of `k`)
     - `permutation[3] = curr_v = 5`
     - `permutation[5] = curr_v = 6`

4. **Final Value of `curr_v`**:
   - After the loop completes, `curr_v` is equal to `n + 1`.

5. **Constructing the `result` String**:
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.
   - For the example with `k = 2` and `n = 6`, the `permutation` list would be `[1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]`.
   - Therefore, `result` would be `"1 4 2 5 3 6"`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the logic described, the `print(result)` statement will print the elements of the `permutation` list separated by spaces.

Output: **"1 4 2 5 3 6" (where the elements of the permutation list are determined based on the given conditions)**

Note: The exact values in the `permutation` list will depend on the specific values of `n` and `k` provided in the input. The example provided is for `k = 2` and `n = 6`. For different values of `n` and `k`, the output will vary accordingly.
