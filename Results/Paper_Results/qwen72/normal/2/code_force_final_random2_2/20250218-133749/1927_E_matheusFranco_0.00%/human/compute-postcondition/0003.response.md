The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer value between 1 and 10^4, after decrementing by 1, `t` will now be an integer value between 0 and 10^4 - 1. The function `func_1()` has already been called and remains unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `func_1()` has been called.**
