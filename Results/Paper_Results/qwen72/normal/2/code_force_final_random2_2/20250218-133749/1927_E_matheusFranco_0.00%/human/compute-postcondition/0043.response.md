Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `2 < n` is true, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. The new value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`.
