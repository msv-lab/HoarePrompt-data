Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of generating a k-level permutation for a given n and k, where k is even. The main logic is implemented in `func_1`, which constructs the permutation based on the specified rules. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Permutation Generation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It fills the `permutation` list in a way that ensures the k-level condition is met:
     - It iterates over indices from 0 to `k-1`.
     - For each index `i`, it fills the positions in the `permutation` list that are multiples of `k` plus `i` with consecutive values starting from 1.
   - After filling the `permutation` list, it converts the list to a space-separated string and prints it.

3. **K-Level Condition**:
   - The key part of the algorithm is ensuring that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - By distributing the values in a pattern that alternates between different starting points (multiples of `k` plus `i`), the algorithm ensures that the sums of these segments are balanced.

4. **Validation**:
   - The provided state comments indicate that the function correctly handles the input constraints and generates the required permutation.
   - The example output matches the expected k-level permutation for the given inputs.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for generating k-level permutations as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
