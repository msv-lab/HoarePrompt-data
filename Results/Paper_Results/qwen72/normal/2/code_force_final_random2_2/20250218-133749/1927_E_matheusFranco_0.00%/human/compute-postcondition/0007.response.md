The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer value between 0 and 10^4 - 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer value between 1 and 10^4 - 2, `func_1()` has been called twice.**
