t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the grid is represented by two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}...a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}...a_{2n}, each of length n, consisting of 0s and 1s. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
