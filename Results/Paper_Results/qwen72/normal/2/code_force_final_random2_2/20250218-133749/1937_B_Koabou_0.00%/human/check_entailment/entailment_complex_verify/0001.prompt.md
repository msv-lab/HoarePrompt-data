You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. Each test case consists of two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of the grid.

    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is 1 if the condition was never met, or x - i + 1 if the condition was met at iteration i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the input. It checks for the first position where the next character in the first string is '1' and the current character in the second string is '0'. If such a position is found, it constructs a new string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the first string up to this position with the suffix of the second string starting from this position. It also calculates a value `t` based on the longest prefix of the first string that matches the corresponding prefix of the new string `s`. Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the value `t`. If no such position is found, it prints the first string concatenated with the last character of the second string and sets `t` to 1. The function processes one test case per call.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them using a loop. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It also initializes a variable `x` to keep track of the point where the path switches from the top row to the bottom row.
   - The program iterates through the columns from 0 to `n-2` (since the last column is always included).
   - For each column, it checks if the next cell in the top row is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row is '0'. If this condition is met, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the top row up to the current column and the suffix of the bottom row starting from the current column. It also sets `x` to the current column index and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such switch point is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row and the last cell of the bottom row.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will store the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates through the columns up to `x` and checks if the prefix of the top row matches the prefix of the constructed string `s`. If it does, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It then prints the number of paths `t`.

### Analysis:
- The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string seems correct. It correctly identifies the point where switching to the bottom row would result in a smaller string and constructs the string accordingly.
- The logic for counting the number of paths is also correct. It correctly counts the number of ways to reach the switch point and the number of ways to continue from there.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
