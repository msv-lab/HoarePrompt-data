Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), and `x` is the index where the condition was met (if it was met) or `n - 1` (if it was never met).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` are equal to the first `i + 1` characters of `s`, then `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. If the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is true, `t` is set to `x` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), `x` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, then `t` is updated to `x - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
