To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, sep='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list containing two input strings.
   - `t` is initially set to 1.
   - `s` is determined based on whether the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is met at any iteration `i` within the range of `0` to `x-1`.

2. **Condition and Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `x-1`.
   - If `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is true at any iteration `i`, then `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` and the loop breaks.
   - If the condition is never met, `t` remains 1.

3. **Determination of `s`:**
   - If the condition was met at some index `x`, then `s` is the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x`.
   - If the condition was never met, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`.
   - `x` is the index where the condition was met (if it was met) or `n - 1` (if it was never met).
   - `i` is `x - 1` (the last index the loop iterated over).

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(s, sep='')` statement will print the value of `s` without any separators.

### Analysis:
- If the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is met at some index `i`, then `s` will be constructed as follows:
  - `s = a[0][:x + 1] + a[1][x:]`
  - Here, `x` is the index where the condition was met.
- If the condition is never met, then `s` will be:
  - `s = a[0] + a[1][-1]`
  - Here, `x` is `n - 1`.

### Final Output:
- If the condition is met at some index `x`, the output will be the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x`.
- If the condition is never met, the output will be the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`.

Output: **s (where s is the concatenation of the first x + 1 characters of a[0] and the substring of a[1] starting from index x if the condition was met, or the concatenation of a[0] and the last character of a[1] if the condition was never met)**
