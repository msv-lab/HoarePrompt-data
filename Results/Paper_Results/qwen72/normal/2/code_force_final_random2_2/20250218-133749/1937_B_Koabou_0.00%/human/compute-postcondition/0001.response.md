Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. Each test case consists of two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of the grid. `a` is an empty list. `n` is an input integer.**
