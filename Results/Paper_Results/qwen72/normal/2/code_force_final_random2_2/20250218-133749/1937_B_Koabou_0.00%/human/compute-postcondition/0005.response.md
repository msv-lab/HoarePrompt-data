The code appends a new input string to the list `a`. Since the loop has already executed 2 times, `a` initially contains two input strings. After executing the given code, `a` will contain three strings, including the newly appended input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing three input strings, and the loop has executed 2 times.**
