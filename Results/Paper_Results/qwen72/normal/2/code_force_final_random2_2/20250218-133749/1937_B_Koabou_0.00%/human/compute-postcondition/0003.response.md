The code appends two inputs to the list `a`. Each input is taken from the user during each iteration of the loop. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. After the execution, `a` will contain two elements, which are the inputs provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, and the loop has executed 2 times.**
