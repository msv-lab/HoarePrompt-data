Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), and `x` is the index where the condition was met (if it was met) or `n - 1` (if it was never met).**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is set to 1.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
