Output State: **`t` is `x`, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `x - i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `x - 1 + 1`, which is just `x`. Therefore, `t` is now equal to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
