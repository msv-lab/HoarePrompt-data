Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `x` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` remains an empty list if the conditions for breaking out of the loop were not met in the previous iteration. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, then `x` is set to 1, `i` remains 1, `s` is the concatenation of the first 2 characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
