The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the input. It checks for the first position where the next character in the first string is '1' and the current character in the second string is '0'. If such a position is found, it constructs a new string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the first string up to this position with the suffix of the second string starting from this position. It also calculates a value `t` based on the longest prefix of the first string that matches the corresponding prefix of the new string `s`. Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the value `t`. If no such position is found, it prints the first string concatenated with the last character of the second string and sets `t` to 1. The function processes one test case per call.
