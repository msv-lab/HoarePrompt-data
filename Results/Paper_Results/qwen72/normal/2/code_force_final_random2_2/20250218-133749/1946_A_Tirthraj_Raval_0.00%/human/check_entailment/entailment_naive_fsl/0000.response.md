Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the result. Specifically, the line `res = a.count(a[p])` is incorrect because it counts the occurrences of the current median in the array, which does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
2 2 8
```
The current median is 2. According to the program, `a.count(a[p])` will return 2 because the number 2 appears twice in the array. However, the correct answer should be 1, as increasing the first element from 2 to 3 will change the median to 3.

Thus, the program fails to handle this case correctly.
