Reasoning:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by calculating the median of the array and counting how many times the median appears in the array. However, this approach is incorrect because the goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array, not to count the occurrences of the current median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the current median.
3. Determine the smallest value greater than the current median.
4. Calculate the number of operations needed to make the current median equal to this smallest value.

The provided code does not perform these steps correctly. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of the current median, which does not help in determining the minimum number of operations to increase the median.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1  # Index of the median in the sorted array
        
        current_median = a[p]
        
        # Find the smallest value greater than the current median
        next_value = current_median + 1
        while p < n and a[p] == current_median:
            p += 1
        
        if p < n:
            next_value = a[p]
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed
        operations = (next_value - current_median) * (n // 2 + 1 - (n % 2 == 0))
        
        print(operations)
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the smallest value greater than the current median and calculates the number of operations needed to increase the median.

Given the incorrect logic in the provided program, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
