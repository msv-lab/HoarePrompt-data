The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `ap` which specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, it calculates and prints a result based on specific conditions: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a modified value of `x` and prints a combined result; if only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`; if only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`; otherwise, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the state of the program includes the processed inputs and printed results.
