### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `ap` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Handling 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 2 of the 2x2 icons (since a screen is 5x3, and a 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, leaving 11 cells free, which is enough for another 2x2 icon).

3. **Adjusting Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program attempts to adjust the remaining 1x1 icons using the formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This formula is incorrect. The correct approach should be to subtract the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total number of 1x1 icons, which should be `x = x - y * 4`.

4. **Calculating Screens for Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - If there are any remaining 1x1 icons (`x > 0`), the program calculates the number of additional screens needed using `math.ceil(x / 15)`. This part is correct.

5. **Special Cases**:
   - If there are no 1x1 icons (`x == 0`) but some 2x2 icons (`y > 0`), it directly prints the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
   - If there are no 2x2 icons (`y == 0`) but some 1x1 icons (`x > 0`), it directly prints the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons.
   - If both `x` and `y` are zero, it prints 0.

### Corrected Logic:
- Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons: `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- Adjust the remaining 1x1 icons: `x = x - y * 4`.
- Calculate the number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons: `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15)`.
- Print the total number of screens: `print(bxsfory + bxsfory1)`.

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the way it adjusts the remaining 1x1 icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
