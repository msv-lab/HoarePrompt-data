The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input provided by the user. The input is split into two parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `x` and `y`, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `ap`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `ap` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0**
