Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` is updated to \(x - (\lceil y / 2 \rceil \times 15) + (y \times 4)\).
- `y` is greater than 0.
- `ap` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `bxsfory` is the ceiling of \(y / 2\).
- `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of \(x / 15\).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate `bxsfory`:**
   - `bxsfory` is the ceiling of \(y / 2\).
   - Since `y` is greater than 0, `bxsfory` will be a positive integer.

2. **Update `x`:**
   - `x` is updated to \(x - (\lceil y / 2 \rceil \times 15) + (y \times 4)\).
   - Let's denote \(\lceil y / 2 \rceil\) as `ceil_y_2`.
   - The update formula becomes: \(x = x - (ceil_y_2 \times 15) + (y \times 4)\).

3. **Determine `bxsfory1`:**
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of \(x / 15\).
   - We need to evaluate the new value of `x` after the update to determine `bxsfory1`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some specific values to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `y = 5`.
- Then, `ceil_y_2 = \lceil 5 / 2 \rceil = 3`.
- Suppose the initial value of `x` is 100.

#### Update `x`:
\[ x = 100 - (3 \times 15) + (5 \times 4) \]
\[ x = 100 - 45 + 20 \]
\[ x = 75 \]

#### Determine `bxsfory1`:
- Since `x = 75` is greater than 0, `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of \(75 / 15\).
- \(\lceil 75 / 15 \rceil = 5\).

#### Calculate `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`:
- `bxsfory = 3`
- `bxsfory1 = 5`
- `bxsfory1 + bxsfory = 5 + 3 = 8`

### General Case:
- The value of `bxsfory` is always a positive integer because `y` is greater than 0.
- The value of `bxsfory1` depends on the updated value of `x`. If the updated `x` is positive, `bxsfory1` will be the ceiling of \(x / 15\). If the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` will be 0.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.

Output: **bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory1 is the ceiling of x / 15 if x > 0, otherwise 0, and bxsfory is the ceiling of y / 2)**
