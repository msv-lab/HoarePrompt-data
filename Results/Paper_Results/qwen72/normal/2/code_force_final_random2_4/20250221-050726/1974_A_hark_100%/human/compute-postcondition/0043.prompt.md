Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; ap is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(ap):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `ap` must be greater than 0, and `k` is 0. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`, `y` remains greater than 0, `ap` remains greater than 0, `k` remains 0, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the condition holds. Otherwise, either `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, or `x` is less than or equal to 0, or `y` is not equal to 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `ap` remains greater than 1, `k` is 1, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, and `y` remains the same as the user-provided value. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the condition holds. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the condition also holds. If neither of these conditions hold, then either `x` is less than or equal to 0, or `y` is not equal to 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `ap` remains greater than 2, `k` is 2, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, or if `x > 0` and `y == 0`, or in any other case where `x` and `y` do not satisfy `x > 0` and `y > 0`, the values of `x`, `y`, `ap`, `k`, `bxsfory`, and `bxsfory1` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
