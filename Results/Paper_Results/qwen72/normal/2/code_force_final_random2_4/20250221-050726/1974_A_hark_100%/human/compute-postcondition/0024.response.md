To determine what will be printed by the `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
   - `y` is the same as the user-provided value.
   - `ap` remains greater than 1.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the condition holds.
   - Otherwise, either `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, or `x` is less than or equal to 0, or `y` is not equal to 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Calculate `bxsfory`:
     \[
     \text{bxsfory} = \left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil
     \]
   - Update `x`:
     \[
     \text{new\_x} = x - \text{bxsfory} \times 15 + y \times 4
     \]
   - Determine `bxsfory1`:
     - If `new_x` is less than or equal to 0, then `bxsfory1 = 0`.
     - Otherwise, `bxsfory1 = \left\lceil \frac{\text{new\_x}}{15} \right\rceil`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.

Given the conditions and the calculations, the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but we can describe the output based on the given logic.

Output: **bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory is the ceiling of y / 2 and bxsfory1 is 0 if the new x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of the new x / 15)**
