Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.
- `ap` remains greater than 2.
- `k` is 2.
- `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

### Explanation:
- The `math.ceil(y / 2)` function calculates the ceiling of `y / 2`. This means it takes the value of `y`, divides it by 2, and then rounds up to the nearest integer.
- Since `y` is an integer provided by the user input, the value of `math.ceil(y / 2)` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

### Output:
Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is the user-provided integer value)**

This means the output will be the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.
