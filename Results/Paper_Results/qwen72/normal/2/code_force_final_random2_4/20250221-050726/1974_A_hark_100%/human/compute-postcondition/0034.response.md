Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is an integer provided by the user input, `ap` remains greater than 2, `k` is 2, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`.**
