Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`, `y` is greater than 0, `ap` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
