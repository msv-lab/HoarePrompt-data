Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.
- `ap` remains greater than 2.
- `k` is 2.
- `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Explanation:
- The `math.ceil(x / 15)` function calculates the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15. This means it rounds up the result of `x / 15` to the nearest integer.
- Since `x` is an integer provided by the user input, the exact value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `x`.

### Output:
Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is the integer provided by the user input)**

This means the output will be the ceiling of `x` divided by 15, where `x` is the integer provided by the user input.
