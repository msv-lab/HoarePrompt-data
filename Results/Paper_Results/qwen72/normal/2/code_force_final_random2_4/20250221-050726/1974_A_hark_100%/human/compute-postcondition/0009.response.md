Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `ap` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, and `x` is 0 while `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, which is now specifically `x` being 0.**
