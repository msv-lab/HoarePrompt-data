Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `ap` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.** 

Explanation: The variable `bxsfory` is assigned the value of the ceiling of `y / 2`. This means that `bxsfory` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `ap`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
