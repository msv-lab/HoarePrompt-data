Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `ap` remains greater than 2, `k` is 2, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, or if `x > 0` and `y == 0`, or in any other case where `x` and `y` do not satisfy `x > 0` and `y > 0`, the values of `x`, `y`, `ap`, `k`, `bxsfory`, and `bxsfory1` remain unchanged.***
