Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `ap` remains greater than 1, `k` is 1, `x` and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the condition holds. Otherwise, if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the condition holds. If neither of these conditions hold, then either `x` is less than or equal to 0, or `y` is not equal to 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.***
