Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 2, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with -1000000000.0, followed by the values returned by `r()`, and ending with 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is a list with the values [0, 0], `u` is 0, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`**. 

The code snippet `b = [0, 0]` initializes the list `b` to contain two zeros. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
