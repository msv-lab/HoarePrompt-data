The function `r()` is called, but there is no definition or description of what this function does. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the state of the program. However, since the function call does not specify any arguments or return values, and assuming it does not modify global variables or have side effects, the state of the program remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
