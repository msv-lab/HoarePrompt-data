To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1.
- `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `queries` is a list of `m` pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.
- `b` is a list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.
- `u` is the value returned by `r()` minus 3.
- `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`.

### Analysis:
1. **List `b`**:
   - `b` is a list where the last two elements are cumulative sums of differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions. This means `b` is likely a list of cumulative sums, but the exact values depend on the specific conditions applied to the differences in `a`.

2. **Indices `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are values returned by the function `r()`. Since `r()` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it returns valid indices for the list `b`.
   - The indices used in the `print` statement are `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement calculates the difference between the elements at indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Indices Calculation**:
   - `index_d = (d - 1) * 2`
   - `index_c = (c - 1) * 2`

2. **Value Extraction**:
   - `value_d = b[index_d]`
   - `value_c = b[index_c]`

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - `result = value_d - value_c`

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, and the specific conditions for generating `b` are not detailed, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list of cumulative sums of differences between consecutive elements in a that satisfy certain conditions, and c and d are indices returned by r())**
