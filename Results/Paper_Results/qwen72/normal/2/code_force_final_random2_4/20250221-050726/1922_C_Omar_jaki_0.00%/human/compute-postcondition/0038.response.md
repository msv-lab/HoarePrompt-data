Postcondition: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is a list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions, `u` is the value returned by `r()` minus 3, `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`. If `c` < `d`, the program follows the conditions specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program follows the conditions specified in the else part.**
