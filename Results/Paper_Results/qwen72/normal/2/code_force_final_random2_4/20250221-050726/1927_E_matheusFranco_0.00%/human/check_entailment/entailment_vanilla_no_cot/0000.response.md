Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly addresses the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Permutation Construction**: In `func_1()`, the program constructs a permutation of length `n` that satisfies the k-level condition. It does this by distributing the numbers from 1 to `n` in a way that ensures the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by at most 1.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program initializes an array `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then iterates over the first `k` positions, placing the current value `curr_v` at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`. This ensures that the values are distributed evenly across the permutation.
   - The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is used to keep track of the positions where the current value should be placed, incrementing by `k` each time to ensure the values are spread out.

4. **Output**: The constructed permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program ensures that the permutation is valid (contains all integers from 1 to `n`).
   - The construction method guarantees that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` will differ by at most 1, satisfying the k-level condition.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program is correct and will produce the desired output for all valid inputs.
