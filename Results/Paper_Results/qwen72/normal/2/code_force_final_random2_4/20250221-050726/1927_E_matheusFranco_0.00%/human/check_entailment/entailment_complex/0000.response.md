Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of every contiguous segment of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The key is to ensure that the sums of these segments are as close as possible.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function reads `n` and `k` from the input, initializes a permutation list of length `n`, and fills it with values such that the condition for a k-level permutation is met. The filling strategy is to place consecutive integers in positions that are multiples of `k` plus a fixed offset `i` (from 0 to `k-1`). This ensures that the sums of the segments of length `k` are balanced.
   - **func_2**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case. It correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Permutation Generation**: The way `func_1` fills the permutation ensures that the sums of the segments of length `k` are balanced. By placing consecutive integers in a pattern that spreads them evenly across the permutation, the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of the segments is minimized.
   - **Input/Output Handling**: `func_2` correctly handles the input for multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the output format matches the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program meets the problem requirements and generates the correct k-level permutations for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
