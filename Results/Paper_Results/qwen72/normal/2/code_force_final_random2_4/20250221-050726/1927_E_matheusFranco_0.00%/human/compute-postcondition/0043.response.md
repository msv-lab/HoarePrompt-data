Output State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v - 1`, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`.
- The values of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`, `n`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `curr_v` is increased by 1 as specified in the initial state.
