Output State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v - 1`, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `curr_v` is increased by 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`, so after the increment, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` remains set to the original value of `curr_v` (which is now `curr_v - 1`). The value of `n` remains unchanged.
