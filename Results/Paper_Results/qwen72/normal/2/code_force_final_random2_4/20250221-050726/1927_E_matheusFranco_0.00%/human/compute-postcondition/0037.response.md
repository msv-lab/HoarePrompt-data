Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `permutation[1]` is `curr_v`, `permutation[1 + k]` is `curr_v + 1`, `permutation[1 + 2 * k]` is `curr_v + 2`, ..., `permutation[n - 1]` is the final value of `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`permutation`**: Initially, `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`). After the loop, the elements at positions `1, 1 + k, 1 + 2 * k, ..., n - 1` are filled with the values starting from `curr_v` and incrementing by 1 each time.
- **`curr_v`**: Starts as the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus one. After the loop, it will be equal to `n` because the loop fills the remaining positions in the `permutation` list.
- **`multiples_of_k_plus_i`**: Starts at 1 and is incremented by `k` in each iteration. After the loop, it will be equal to `n` because the loop stops when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `len(permutation)`.
- **Other Variables**: `idx`, `idx_v`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
