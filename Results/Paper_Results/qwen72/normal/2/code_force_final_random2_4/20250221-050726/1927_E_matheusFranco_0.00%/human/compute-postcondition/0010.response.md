Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` is now `0` (indicating the loop has completed its iterations), and `func_1()` has been called `t` times, where `t` is the initial value of `t`.**

This means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `t` has been decremented to 0, and the function `func_1()` has been called as many times as the initial value of `t`. The state of any other variables not involved in the loop remains unchanged.
