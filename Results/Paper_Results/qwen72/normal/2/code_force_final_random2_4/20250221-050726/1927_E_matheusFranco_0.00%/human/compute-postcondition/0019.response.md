Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus one, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the largest multiple of `k` that is less than `n`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `permutation` will have values set at indices that are multiples of `k`, starting from index 0. Specifically, `permutation[0]` will be 1, `permutation[k]` will be 2, `permutation[2*k]` will be 3, and so on, up to the largest multiple of `k` that is less than `n`.
- The variable `curr_v` will be the next value that would have been assigned if the loop continued, which is the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus one.
- The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be the largest multiple of `k` that is less than `n`.
- All other variables (`idx`, `idx_v`, `i`) remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
