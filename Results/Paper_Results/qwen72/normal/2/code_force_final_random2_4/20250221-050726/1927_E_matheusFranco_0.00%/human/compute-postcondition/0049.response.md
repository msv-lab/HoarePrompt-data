Output State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` must be less than `len(permutation)`**

Explanation:
- The code `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v` assigns the value of `curr_v` to the element in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`.
- The initial state indicates that `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` was already set to `curr_v`, and `curr_v` is increased by 1 after this assignment.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k` after the assignment.
- The condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` must be less than `len(permutation)` remains unchanged and is still valid.
- The value of `n` and the constraints on `k` and `n` remain unchanged.
- No other variables are affected by the code.
