To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

### Current State:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2 * k`
- `len(permutation)` is `n` (since `permutation` is a list of length `n`)

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`, which translates to `1 + 2 * k < n`.

Given the current state:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2 * k`
- `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `1 + 2 * k < n` must hold true. Since `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`, the condition `1 + 2 * k < n` should already be satisfied if the loop has executed at least once.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to verify that `n` is greater than `1 + 2 * k`.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop has already executed once, and the condition `1 + 2 * k < n` must have been true for the loop to start, no adjustments are needed to the state. The loop can proceed as long as the current state remains unchanged.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `permutation[1]` is `curr_v`, `permutation[1 + k]` is `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `(n // k) + 3`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2 * k`**
