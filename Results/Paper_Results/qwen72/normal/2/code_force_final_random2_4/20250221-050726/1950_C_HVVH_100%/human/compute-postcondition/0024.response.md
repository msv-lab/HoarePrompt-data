Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is the integer value of the hour part of the new input minus 12, `m` is the integer value of the minute part of the new input, `day` is 'PM'.** 

The code changes the value of `day` from 'AM' to 'PM', while the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged.
