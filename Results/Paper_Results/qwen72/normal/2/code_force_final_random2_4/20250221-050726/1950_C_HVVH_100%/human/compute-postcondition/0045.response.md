Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from the user, then for each of the next `n` lines, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm". For each time, it converts the 24-hour format to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and prints the converted time. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and the last processed hour and minute values (`h` and `m`) and the corresponding AM/PM indicator (`day`) reflect the state of the last iteration. **
