Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is an integer representing the minute part of the input time, `h` is not equal to 0, `h` is less than or equal to 12, and `day` is 'PM' if `h` is 12. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.***
