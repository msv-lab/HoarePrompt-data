To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is the integer value of the minute part of the new input.
- `h` is the hour part of the time `s`.
- If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'.
- If `h` > 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
- Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - `s` is in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part (first two characters).
   - `m` is the minute part (last two characters).

2. **Adjusting `h` and Setting `day`:**
   - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, it is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

3. **Formatting the Output:**
   - The hour `h` is formatted to a two-digit string with leading zeros if necessary.
   - The minute `m` is formatted to a two-digit string with leading zeros if necessary.
   - The `day` variable is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s = "13:45"`:
- `h = 13`
- `m = 45`
- Since `h` > 12, `h` is adjusted to `13 - 12 = 1` and `day` is set to 'PM'.

The print statement will then output:
```
01:45 PM
```

### General Case:
For any valid time `s` in the format "hh:mm":
- The hour `h` will be adjusted according to the rules described.
- The minute `m` will remain as the last two digits of `s`.
- The `day` will be either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.

### Final Output:
Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h is the adjusted hour based on the rules, m is the minute part of the time s, and day is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of h)**

This output format ensures that the time is correctly formatted and the AM/PM indicator is accurately determined based on the initial state.
