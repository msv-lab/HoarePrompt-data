Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start and end are integers where start <= end, representing the range of folder names to be processed. The current directory contains subfolders named with digits, and some of these subfolders may contain .html files. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *start and end are integers where start <= end, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific state), `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the condition is met. Otherwise, `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is odd. If '11' is in `s`, the string `s` contains the substring '11'. Otherwise, the substring '11' is not present in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0 (but one less than before), `_` is a placeholder (no specific state), `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a new input string. If `cnt1` (the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`) is greater than 2 and even, the condition is met. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, or if `cnt1` is 1, the condition is also met. Otherwise, `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even. If '11' is in the new value of `s`, the string `s` contains the substring '11'. Otherwise, the substring '11' is not present in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0 (but one less than before), `_` is a placeholder (no specific state), `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the condition is met. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, or if `cnt1` is 1, the condition is also met. Otherwise, `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even. If '11' is in the new value of `s`, the string `s` contains the substring '11'. Otherwise, the substring '11' is not present in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
