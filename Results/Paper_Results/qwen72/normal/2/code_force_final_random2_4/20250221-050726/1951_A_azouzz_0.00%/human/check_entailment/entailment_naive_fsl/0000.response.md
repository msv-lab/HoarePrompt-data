Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description requires a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that generates files for HTML files in subdirectories within a specified range. However, the provided program defines a completely different function `func_1` that processes a series of inputs and checks conditions related to the count of '1's in a string. This function does not perform any file operations or directory traversals as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
