Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is \((a - (b + 1) \cdot b) // (b + 1)^2 + 1\). If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `suma` remains 0.***
