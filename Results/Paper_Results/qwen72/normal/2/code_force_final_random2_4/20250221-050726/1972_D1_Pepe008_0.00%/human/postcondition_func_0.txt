The function reads a series of inputs, processes them, and prints a result for each set of inputs. Specifically, it first reads an integer `T` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`, and prints the result of this calculation minus one. The function does not return any values; it only prints results to the console. After the function concludes, the state includes the processed inputs and the printed results, but the original input variables `n` and `m` are not affected.
