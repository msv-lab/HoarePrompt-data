Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is a positive integer, `t` is `T - 1`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the last input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for all valid `i` from 1 to `b` where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\) for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `T` times, so after all iterations, `t` will be `T - 1`.
- For each iteration, `info` is updated with the split input, and `a` and `b` are derived from `info`.
- The variable `i` is used in the inner loop and will end up being `b + 1` after the loop completes.
- `suma` accumulates the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for all valid `i` from 1 to `b` where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\).
- The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
