Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `b`, `suma` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets `suma` to 0, which overrides the previous value of `suma`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition for calculating `suma` as the sum of a specific expression is not executed in this snippet, so `suma` is simply reset to 0.
