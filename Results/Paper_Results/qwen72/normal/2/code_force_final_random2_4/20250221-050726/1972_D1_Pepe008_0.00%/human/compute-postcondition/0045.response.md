The provided Python code snippet is a nested loop that iterates over a range of values for `i` and `j`, and prints pairs `(i, j)` that satisfy a certain condition. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program state:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `T` is greater than 1.
- `t` is 2.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1.
- `i` is `b + 1`.
- `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop where `x` is \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive, provided that `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for each iteration.

### Code Analysis:
```python
for i in range(1, a + 1):
    for j in range(4, b + 1):
        if int((j + i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j))) == 0:
            print(i, j)
```

- This code does not modify any of the variables `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or `suma`.
- The only action performed by this code is printing pairs `(i, j)` that satisfy the condition `int((j + i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j))) == 0`.

### Impact on Program State:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `suma` remain unchanged.
- The code only prints certain pairs `(i, j)` to the console, which does not affect the state of the variables.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop where `x` is \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive, provided that `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for each iteration.**
