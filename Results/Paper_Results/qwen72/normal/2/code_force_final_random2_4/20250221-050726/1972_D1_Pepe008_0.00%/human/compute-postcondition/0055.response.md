Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2, `i` is 2. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) and `suma` is updated to `suma + x`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `suma` is not modified.**
