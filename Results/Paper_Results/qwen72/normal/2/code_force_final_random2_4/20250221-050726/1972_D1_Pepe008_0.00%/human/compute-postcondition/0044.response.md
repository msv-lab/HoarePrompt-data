The provided code snippet assigns the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]` to `a` and `b` respectively. Since `a` and `b` were already defined in the initial state with the same values (`a` as the integer value of `info[0]` and `b` as the integer value of `info[1]` and at least 1), the assignment does not change their values.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop where `x` is \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive, provided that `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for each iteration.**
