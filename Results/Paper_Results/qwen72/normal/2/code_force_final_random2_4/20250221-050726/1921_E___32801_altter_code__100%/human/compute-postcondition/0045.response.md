Given the initial state and the provided conditions, let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print('Alice')` statement is executed.

### Initial State and Conditions:
1. `n` is `r[0]`.
2. `m` is `r[1]`.
3. `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`.
4. `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
5. `y2` is either 1 or `m`.
6. `x2` is greater than `x1`.
7. The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
8. `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
9. `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is an odd number.
10. `t` is `abs(r[5] - y1)`.
11. `x2` is greater than `x1`.
12. `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
13. `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
14. If `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, then:
    - `y1` is `r[3] - r[5] + 2`.
    - `a` is `r[5] - 1`.
    - `c` is `y1 - 1`.
15. Otherwise, if `y2` is greater than `y1`, then:
    - `y1` is `r[3] - 1 + a`.
    - `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`.
    - `c` is `m - y1`.
16. `b // 2` is greater than `a`.
17. The absolute value of the difference between `x2` and `c` is greater than or equal to the sum of `x1` and `c`.
18. `y1` is between 1 and `m` inclusive.
19. `x1` is between 1 and `n` inclusive.

### Analysis:
- The `print('Alice')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('Alice')` statement will print the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
