Output State: **The program does not return any value.** 

Explanation: The provided code snippet ends with a `return` statement without specifying any value to return. In Python, when a function reaches a `return` statement without a value, it implicitly returns `None`. However, since the task specifies to describe the output state in natural language and to focus on the values or variables that are returned, and no specific value or variable is mentioned in the `return` statement, the output state is that the program does not return any value.
