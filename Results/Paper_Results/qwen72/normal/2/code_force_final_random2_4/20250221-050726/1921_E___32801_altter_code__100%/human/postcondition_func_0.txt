The function `func_1` reads a list of integers from user input, representing the dimensions of a board and the initial positions of two chips. It then determines the outcome of a game based on the positions of these chips and prints one of three possible results: 'Alice', 'bob', or 'draw'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state includes the processed input values and the printed result, but no changes are made to external variables or data structures.
