To determine what will be printed when the `print('draw')` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` is `r[0]`
- `m` is `r[1]`
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`
- `b` is `(r[4] - a) - x1`
- `x2 > x1`
- `x1 >= 1`
- `x2 <= n`

### Conditions:
1. If `y1 <= y2`:
   - `x1` is `r[2]`
   - `y1` is `1`
   - `y2` is `r[5] - a`
   - `t` is `abs(r[5] - 1)`
   - `c` is `r[5] - a - 1`

2. If `y1 > y2`:
   - `x1` is `r[2] + (m - y1)`
   - `y1` is `m`
   - `y2` is `r[5] + a`
   - `t` is `abs((r[5] + a) - m)`
   - `c` is `r[1] - (r[5] + a)`

### Additional Constraints:
- Either `b // 2 <= a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`, or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`.

### Analysis:
The `print('draw')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'draw'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('draw')` statement will always print the string `'draw'`, regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions provided in the initial state.

Output: **draw**
