The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` from the list `a` to the current value of `sums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input
- `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 1
- `x` is an integer provided by the user input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `i` is 2
- `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again
- If `i` was 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sums]`, and `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`
- If `i` was not 0 and `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is extended with the value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`
- If `i` was not 0 and `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is extended with the value of `sums + a[0]` and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]` (since `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1)

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 1, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.**
