To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is a user-provided integer.
- `k` is a user-provided integer.
- `x` is a user-provided integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The first element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and subsequent elements are updated based on the conditions within the loop.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, but it is reversed.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
   - `i` is set to `k + 1`.
   - `ans` is initialized as a list with `k + 1` elements.

2. **First Element of `ans`:**
   - The first element of `ans` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
     - `sum(a[:x])` is the sum of the first `x` elements of the reversed list `a`.
     - `2 * sum(a[:x])` is twice this sum.
     - `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` is the initial value of `sums`.

3. **Subsequent Elements of `ans`:**
   - The subsequent elements of `ans` are updated based on the conditions within the loop.
   - The exact update rule is not provided in the initial state, but it is implied that each element in `ans` is derived from the previous value of `sums` and some operation involving the elements of `a`.

4. **Finding the Maximum Value:**
   - The `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value from the list `ans`.

### Final Output:
The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value from the list `ans`, which contains `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, starting with `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and updating based on the conditions within the loop.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements, each representing the value of sums after each iteration of the loop, starting with sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]))**
