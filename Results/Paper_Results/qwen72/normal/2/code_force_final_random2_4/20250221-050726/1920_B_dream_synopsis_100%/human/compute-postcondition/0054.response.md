The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Since `ans` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `ans` contains one element which is the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**
