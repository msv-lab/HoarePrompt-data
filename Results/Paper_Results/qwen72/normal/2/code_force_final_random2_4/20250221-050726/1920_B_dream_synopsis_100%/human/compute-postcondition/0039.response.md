To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an integer provided by user input.
- `k` is an integer provided by user input and must be at least 0.
- `x` is an integer provided by user input.
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by user input.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements.
  - The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
  - For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`):
    - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
    - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `i` is initialized to `k + 1`.
   - `ans` is a list with `k + 1` elements.

2. **First Element of `ans`:**
   - The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - This means it is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements in `a`.

3. **Subsequent Elements of `ans`:**
   - For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`):
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.

4. **Finding the Maximum Value in `ans`:**
   - The `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value from the list `ans`.

### Final Output:
The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value from the list `ans`. The exact value depends on the specific values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the elements in the list `a`.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements, with the first element being sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), and subsequent elements calculated based on the conditions provided)**
