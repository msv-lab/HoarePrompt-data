The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i-1` from the list `a`. Since `i` is 1, the element at index 0 of `a` is added to `sums`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` (if `i` was not 0) or `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` (if `i` was 0), `sums` is now `sums + a[0]`, `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.**
