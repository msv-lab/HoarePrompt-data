The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range specified by the input. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. Given the initial state, the variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is already defined as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Therefore, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Since the loop uses `int(input())` to determine the number of iterations, and `t` is the number of test cases, we can assume that `int(input())` should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute correctly.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0 (the loop counter starts at 0)**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, as required by the problem statement.
