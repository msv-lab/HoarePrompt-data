Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k`, and `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`, and the second element of `ans` is the updated value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k - 1]`, and the second element of `ans` is the updated value of `sums`.**
