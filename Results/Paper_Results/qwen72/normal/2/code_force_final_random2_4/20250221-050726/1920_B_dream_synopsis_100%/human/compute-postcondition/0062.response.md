The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
- `_` is 1 (unchanged).
- `n` is the user-provided integer (unchanged).
- `k` is the user-provided integer (unchanged).
- `x` is the user-provided integer (unchanged).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed (unchanged).
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a` (unchanged).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged).
- `ans` is a list that contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it retains its previous value (updated).
- `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` (unchanged).

Since `sums` is already calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, appending `sums` to `ans` means that `ans` will now contain one additional element, which is the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` followed by the same value again, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
