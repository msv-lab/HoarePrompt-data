Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The first element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and subsequent elements are updated based on the conditions within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop, ending at `k + 1`.
- The list `ans` is populated with `k + 1` elements, where each element is the value of `sums` after each iteration.
- The first element of `ans` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent iterations, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
