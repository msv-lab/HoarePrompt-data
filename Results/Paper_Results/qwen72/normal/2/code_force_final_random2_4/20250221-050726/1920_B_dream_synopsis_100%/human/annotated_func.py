#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, representing the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. The array a contains n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        a.reverse()
        
        sum1 = sum(a)
        
        ans = []
        
        for i in range(k + 1):
            if i == 0:
                sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
                ans.append(sums)
            elif i + x - 1 < n:
                sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
                ans.append(sums)
            else:
                sums = sums + a[i - 1]
                ans.append(sums)
        
        print(max(ans))
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is equal to `t`, `n` is the last user-provided integer, `k` is the last user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the last user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input for the last test case, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a` for the last test case, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the inner loop for the last test case. The first element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and subsequent elements are updated based on the conditions: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. The final output is the maximum value in `ans` for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove `k`, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 `x`. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of `n` integers, sorts it in descending order, and calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after applying the removal and multiplication operations. The function outputs the maximum sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it prints the results for each test case.
