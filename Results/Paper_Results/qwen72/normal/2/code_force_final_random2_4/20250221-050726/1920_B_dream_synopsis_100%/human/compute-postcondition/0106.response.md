The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Here's the detailed impact on the program state:

- `ans` is updated to include the new element, which is the current value of `sums`.
- The value of `sums` remains unchanged after this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k`, `ans` contains the value of `sums` and now includes an additional element which is the current value of `sums`, and `sums` is now `sums + a[k - 1]`.**
