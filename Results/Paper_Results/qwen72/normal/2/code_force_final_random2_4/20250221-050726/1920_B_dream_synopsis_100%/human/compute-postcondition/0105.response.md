The given code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- The value of `i` is currently `k`.
- The value of `a` is a reversed list of integers provided by the user.
- The value of `k` is a non-negative integer provided by the user.
- The value of `sums` before this operation is the result of previous operations, which could be `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` was 0, or the value of `sums` from the previous iteration if `i` was not 0.

Given these points, the output state after executing the code snippet is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k`, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and `sums` is now `sums + a[k - 1]`.**
