The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` respectively. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the user's input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input
- `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0
- `x` is an integer provided by the user input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are updated to the values provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.**
