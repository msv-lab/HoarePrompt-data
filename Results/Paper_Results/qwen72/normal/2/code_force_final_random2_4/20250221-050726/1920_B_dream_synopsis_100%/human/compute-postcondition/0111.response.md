Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing three elements (the original two elements plus the value of `sums`), and `sums` is the updated value of `sums` based on the conditions described.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`.
- The value of `sums` is updated based on the conditions provided:
  - If `i` is 0, the second element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
  - If `i` is not 0, the second element of `ans` is the updated value of `sums`.
  - If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`.
  - If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k - 1]`.
- The list `ans` now contains three elements: the original two elements and the value of `sums`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
