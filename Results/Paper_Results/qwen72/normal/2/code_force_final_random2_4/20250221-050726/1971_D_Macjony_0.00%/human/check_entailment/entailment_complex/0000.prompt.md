Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a single parameter, `s`, which is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') with a length of 1 to 500 characters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `s` will be the last input binary string provided, with a length of 2 to 500 characters. The variable `t` will be the same as the initial input value, indicating the total number of iterations. The loop index `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The variable `j` will be equal to `len(s) - 1`, reflecting the last position checked in the string `s`. The variable `count` will represent the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`, adjusted by decrementing by 1 if there was at least one transition from '0' to '1' (`flag` is True). If there were no such transitions, `count` will remain unchanged and `flag` will be False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which specifies the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `t` binary strings provided as input, the function calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string, adjusting the count by subtracting 1 if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'. After processing all `t` strings, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the last processed binary string `s` and the original value of `t`, with the loop index `i` set to `t - 1` and the position index `j` set to `len(s) - 1`.
