Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 4 (if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1') or 4 (if `s[0]` is different from `s[1] but not '0' and '1'), `count` is 3 (if `s[0]` is the same as `s[1]`) or 4 (if `s[0]` is different from `s[1]`), `len(s)` must be greater than 4. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, and if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
