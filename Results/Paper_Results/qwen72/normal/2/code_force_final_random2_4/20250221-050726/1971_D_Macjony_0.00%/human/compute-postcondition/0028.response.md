Output State: **`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 4 or 5 depending on whether `s[2]` (the third character of `s`) is different from `s[3]` (the fourth character of `s`), `count` is 3 or 4 depending on whether `s[2]` (the third character of `s`) is different from `s[3]` (the fourth character of `s`), `flag` is True if `s[2]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '1', and `len(s)` must be greater than 4. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is updated to 4 or 5 depending on whether `s[2]` (the third character of `s`) is different from `s[3]` (the fourth character of `s`), and `flag` is set to True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1'. Now, `j` is incremented by 1, making it 5 or 6 depending on whether `s[2]` (the third character of `s`) is different from `s[3]` (the fourth character of `s`).**
