### Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The `func_1` function uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to count the number of ways to form the given prefix sum array `p` from an array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, where `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices. This initialization is correct because it represents the base case where the prefix sum is zero at the start.

2. **State Transition**:
   - The state transition is correctly implemented. For each position `i` in the array `a`, the program updates the `new_dp` array based on the previous state `dp`. Specifically, it considers both adding 1 and subtracting 1 from the current prefix sum.
   - The transitions are performed using the modulo operation to ensure that the values remain within the bounds of the DP array and to handle large numbers by taking the result modulo \(998,244,353\).

3. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is calculated by checking the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the final prefix sum `p[-1]` plus the offset. This is correct because the final prefix sum should match the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.
   - The use of `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the input into a list of strings is efficient and appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and larger inputs within the constraints.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` is already sorted and valid.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the detailed analysis of the problem description, the program code, and the function summaries, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem and handles all potential cases, including edge cases.

Final: **True**
