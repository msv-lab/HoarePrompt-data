You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

The variable `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it has been assigned to `dp` during each iteration.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, which represents the number of ways to reach the position `final_sum - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD. Here, `final_sum` is the sum of the last element in the list `p` and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It calculates the number of ways to reach a specific position from the starting position (0) using exactly `n` steps, where each step can either be +1 or -1. The specific position is determined by adding the last element of the list `p` to `n`. The result is returned modulo MOD. After the function executes, `n` and `p` remain unchanged, and the function returns an integer representing the number of valid paths to the specified position.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array a. p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of processing each test case. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, which are the sorted prefix sums of a hidden array. The function calls another function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine how many different arrays `a` of size `n` (consisting of only 1 and -1) can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The prefix sum array `p` is derived from `a` and then sorted.
   - The solution should handle multiple test cases and output the result modulo 998,244,353.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the prefix sums.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `i - n` (where `n` is the offset to handle negative indices).
   - The initial state `dp[n] = 1` represents the starting point with a prefix sum of 0.
   - For each element in the array, we update the `dp` array to account for adding 1 or -1 to the current prefix sum.
   - Finally, we check the value of `dp[p[-1] + n]` to get the number of ways to achieve the last prefix sum in the sorted array `p`.

3. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and constructs the necessary data structures for each test case.
   - The results are collected and printed at the end.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `n = 1` and when the prefix sums are not possible (e.g., `p = [0]` for `n = 1`).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the specified range and avoids overflow issues.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program.
   - The logic in `func_1` and the input handling in `func_2` are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
