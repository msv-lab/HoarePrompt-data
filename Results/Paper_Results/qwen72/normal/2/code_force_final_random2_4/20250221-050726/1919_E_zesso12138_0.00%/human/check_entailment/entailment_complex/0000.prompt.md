Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

#Function 1:

    #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is still equal to `n`, and `i` is `n`. The variable `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it has been assigned to `dp` during each iteration.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, which represents the number of ways to reach the position `final_sum - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD. Here, `final_sum` is the sum of the last element in the list `p` and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It calculates the number of ways to reach a specific position from the starting position (0) using exactly `n` steps, where each step can either be +1 or -1. The specific position is determined by adding the last element of the list `p` to `n`. The result is returned modulo MOD. After the function executes, `n` and `p` remain unchanged, and the function returns an integer representing the number of valid paths to the specified position.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array a. p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a.

    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and `results` is now an empty list. The variable `res` is undefined as it was only used within the loop. The state of `t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, and `result` remains unchanged from their final states after the loop's last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of processing each test case. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, which are the sorted prefix sums of a hidden array. The function calls another function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output.
