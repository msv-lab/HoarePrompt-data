To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `results` since it is the only object in the loop head. The loop will execute if `results` is a non-empty list. The other variables mentioned in the state before the loop starts (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `result`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` is a non-empty list. Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`results` must be a non-empty list**
