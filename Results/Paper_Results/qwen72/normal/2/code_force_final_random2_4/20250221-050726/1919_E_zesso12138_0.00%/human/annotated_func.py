    #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is still equal to `n`, and `i` is `n`. The variable `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it has been assigned to `dp` during each iteration.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, which represents the number of ways to reach the position `final_sum - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD. Here, `final_sum` is the sum of the last element in the list `p` and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It calculates the number of ways to reach a specific position from the starting position (0) using exactly `n` steps, where each step can either be +1 or -1. The specific position is determined by adding the last element of the list `p` to `n`. The result is returned modulo MOD. After the function executes, `n` and `p` remain unchanged, and the function returns an integer representing the number of valid paths to the specified position.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array a. p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a.

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is 0 (indicating all iterations have completed), `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` from the last iteration, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers from the last iteration, `data` remains a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is equal to the length of `data`, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and `results` is now an empty list. The variable `res` is undefined as it was only used within the loop. The state of `t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, and `result` remains unchanged from their final states after the loop's last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of processing each test case. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, which are the sorted prefix sums of a hidden array. The function calls another function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output.
