The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the expression `2 * n + 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `2 * n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `2 * n + 1` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element `dp[j]` is the sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `j` is 2**.
