### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of possible arrays `a` consisting of only 1 and -1, such that the sorted prefix sums of `a` match the given sorted prefix sums `p`.
   - The prefix sums `p` are already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The solution must handle multiple test cases and return the count modulo 998,244,353.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
   - The `dp` array keeps track of the number of ways to reach each possible sum from 0 to 2*n (with an offset of `n` to handle negative indices).
   - For each step `i` from 1 to `n`, the function updates the `dp` array by considering both +1 and -1 moves.
   - The final result is obtained by looking at the `dp` value corresponding to the final sum of the prefix sums `p`.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 and the prefix sum is 0 (which is impossible).
   - The program also handles cases where the prefix sums are not achievable with any combination of 1 and -1.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program correctly applies the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the specified range.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program logic aligns with the problem statement and handles all edge cases.
   - The dynamic programming approach is sound and efficiently computes the required counts.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
