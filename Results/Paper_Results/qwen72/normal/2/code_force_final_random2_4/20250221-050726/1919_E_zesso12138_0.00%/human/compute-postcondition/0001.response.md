The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads the entire input stream until EOF using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace.

- `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array a.
- `p` remains a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a.
- `data` is now a list of strings, each element being a part of the input split by whitespace.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace.**
