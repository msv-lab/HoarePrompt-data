You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, and p is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n.
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        
        dp = new_dp
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is still equal to `n`, and `i` is `n`. The variable `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it has been assigned to `dp` during each iteration.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, which represents the number of ways to reach the position `final_sum - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD. Here, `final_sum` is the sum of the last element in the list `p` and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns the number of ways to reach the position `final_sum - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, where `final_sum` is the sum of the last element in `p` and `n`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, which represents the number of ways to reach the position `final_sum - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD. Here, `final_sum` is the sum of the last element in the list `p` and `n`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
