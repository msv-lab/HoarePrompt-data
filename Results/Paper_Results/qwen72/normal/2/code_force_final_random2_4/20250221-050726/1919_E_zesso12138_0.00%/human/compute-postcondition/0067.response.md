Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 initialized to all zeros except `new_dp[0]` which is now `(dp[1] % MOD)`, `j` remains 1.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to its current value and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- Since `j` is 1, `new_dp[j - 1]` is `new_dp[0]`.
- Initially, `new_dp[0]` is 0.
- The value of `dp[1]` is added to `new_dp[0]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`.
- Therefore, `new_dp[0]` is now `(dp[1] % MOD)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
