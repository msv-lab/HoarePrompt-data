The function `func_2` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature provided. However, based on the context given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `p` as described in the parameter constraints. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array `a`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a`.

Given these parameters, the function is expected to process the test cases and return some result based on the hidden array `a` and its prefix sums `p`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the size of the hidden array `a`), and `p` (a list of sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a`). It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the hidden array and its prefix sums.**
