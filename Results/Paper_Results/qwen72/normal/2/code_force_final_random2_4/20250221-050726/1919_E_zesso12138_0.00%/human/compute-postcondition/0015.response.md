Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) - 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[2:2 + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 3 + `n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing from `2 + n` to `3 + n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `results`, `result`) remain unchanged.
