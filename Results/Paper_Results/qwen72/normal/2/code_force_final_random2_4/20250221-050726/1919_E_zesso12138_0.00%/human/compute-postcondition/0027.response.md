Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is 0 (indicating all iterations have completed), `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` from the last iteration, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers from the last iteration, `data` remains a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is equal to the length of `data`, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.**
