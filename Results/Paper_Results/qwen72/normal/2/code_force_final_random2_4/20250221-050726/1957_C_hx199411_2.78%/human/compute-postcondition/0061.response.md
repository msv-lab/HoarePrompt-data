The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again). `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, and `k` must be greater than 1. `i` is 2. `c` and `r` are now updated to the new integers input by the user. `k` must be greater than 2. `num` is incremented by 1.**
