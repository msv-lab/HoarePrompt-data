To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the following variables:
- `i`: The loop variable that will iterate from 3 to `m`.
- `m`: The upper bound of the loop.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 3. This ensures that the range `range(3, m + 1)` is not empty and the loop will execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.
- `t` is decremented by 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again).
- `n` and `k` are integers input by the user.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `c` and `r` are the last integers input by the user.
- `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` or by 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.
- `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.

We need to ensure that `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again), `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers input by the user, `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` or by 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
