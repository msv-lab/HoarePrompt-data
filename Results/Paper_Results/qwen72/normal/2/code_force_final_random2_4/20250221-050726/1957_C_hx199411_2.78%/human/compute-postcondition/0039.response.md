Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `i` is `m`; `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, and `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, ..., `dp[m]` is the final value calculated by the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = m`, updating the `dp` list at each step.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `m`.
- The `dp` list will be fully populated up to index `m`, with each value calculated based on the previous two values in the list.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
