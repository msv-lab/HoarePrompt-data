The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 3, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to have executed up to this point. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10`, `i` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4**
