### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game where you and the computer take turns placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - The goal is to count the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made.
   - The computer mirrors your moves, except when the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), in which case it skips its turn.
   - The solution needs to handle multiple test cases and output the number of configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the board and the number of initial moves.
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves and processes them to determine the number of rooks already placed.

3. **Counting Initial Rooks:**
   - The program iterates through the \( k \) moves and increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( c == r \)) and by 2 otherwise.
   - This correctly counts the number of rooks already placed on the board.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program calculates the number of possible configurations for the remaining \( m = n - num \) positions using dynamic programming.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation is correctly implemented: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the value of `dp[m]`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
  - The moves are read and processed correctly to determine the number of rooks already placed.

- **Counting Initial Rooks:**
  - The logic for counting the number of rooks is correct. If the move is on the diagonal, it adds 1 to `num`; otherwise, it adds 2. This accurately reflects the number of rooks placed on the board.

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem.
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is correctly implemented. This relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions, considering the constraints of the problem.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the result for each test case, which is the value of `dp[m]` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of different final configurations of the chessboard. It handles the input and output correctly, and the dynamic programming approach is appropriate for solving the problem.

Final: **True**
