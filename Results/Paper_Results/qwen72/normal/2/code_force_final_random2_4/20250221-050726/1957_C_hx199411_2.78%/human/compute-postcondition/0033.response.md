To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the following variables:
- `i`: The loop variable that will iterate from 3 to `m + 1`.
- `m`: The upper bound of the loop, which must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is `k - 1`.
- `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, and `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3.

For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 3. This means `m` must be greater than or equal to 3. Since `m` is defined as `n - num`, and `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each pair of `c` and `r`, `num` must be such that `n - num` is at least 3.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `i` should start at 3 (as specified in the loop head).
- `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `i` is 3; `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, and `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3.**
