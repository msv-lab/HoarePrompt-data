To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` is a list with at least 4 elements.
- `b` is a list with the final values computed by the loop, where each element in `b` is the cumulative sum of the conditions evaluated during the loop iterations.
- `u` is 0.
- `c` and `d` are updated to the values returned by `r()`.
- The relationship between `c` and `d` is such that if `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `c` and `d`:**
   - `c` and `d` are values returned by the function `r()`.
   - The relationship between `c` and `d` is that if `c < d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

2. **Accessing Elements in `b`:**
   - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1]` accesses the element in the list `b` at the index `c * 2 - 1`.
   - Similarly, `b[d * 2 - 1]` accesses the element in the list `b` at the index `d * 2 - 1`.

3. **Subtracting the Values:**
   - The `print` statement calculates the difference between the values at these indices: `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result of the subtraction.
- However, we know that `c` and `d` are indices used to access elements in the list `b`, and the result of the subtraction will depend on the values at those indices.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the subtraction of the elements in the list `b` at the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are the values returned by r(), and b is the list with the final values computed by the loop)**
