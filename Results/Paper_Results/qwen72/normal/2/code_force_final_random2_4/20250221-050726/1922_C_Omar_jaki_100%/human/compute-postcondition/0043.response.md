Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list with the first element being -1000000000.0, followed by the values returned by `r()`, and ending with 2000000000.0, `b` is a list with the final values computed by the loop, where each element in `b` is the cumulative sum of the conditions evaluated during the loop iterations, `u` is 0, `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`, and the relationship between `c` and `d` is such that if `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
