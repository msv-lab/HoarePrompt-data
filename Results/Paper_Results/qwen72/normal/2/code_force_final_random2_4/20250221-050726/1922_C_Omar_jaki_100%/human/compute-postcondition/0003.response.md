The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, representing the number of remaining test cases. Each test case consists of `n` (an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` (an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` (where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
