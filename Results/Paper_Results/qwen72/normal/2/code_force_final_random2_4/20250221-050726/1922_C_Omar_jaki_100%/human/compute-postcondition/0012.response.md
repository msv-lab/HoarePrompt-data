Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` must have at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, v, 0 + v * (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y)]`, `v` is `y - x`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `b` is `[0, 0, v]` where `v` is `y - x`.
- The code `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` appends two new elements to the list `b`.
- The first new element is `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`, which simplifies to `0 + v * (v > x - w)` because `b[-2]` is `0`.
- The second new element is `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`, which simplifies to `v + v * (v > z - y)` because `b[-1]` is `v`.
- Therefore, the updated list `b` is `[0, 0, v, 0 + v * (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y)]`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
