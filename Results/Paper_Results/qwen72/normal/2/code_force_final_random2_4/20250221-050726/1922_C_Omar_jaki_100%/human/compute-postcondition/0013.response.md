The only objects in the loop head are the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, and the list `a`. The loop iterates over tuples formed by `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least 5 elements, and the indices for `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` must be valid.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` must have at least 5 elements.
- `b` is `[0, 0, v, 0 + v * (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y)]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The list `a` must still have at least 5 elements.
- The next values for `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the next elements in the respective slices of `a`.

Since the loop is iterating over `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`, the next values for `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th elements of `a`, respectively.

State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` must have at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, v, 0 + v * (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y)]`, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is the 2nd element of `a`, `x` is the 3rd element of `a`, `y` is the 4th element of `a`, `z` is the 5th element of `a`**.
