Postcondition: ***`t` is the integer read from the input minus 2 and must be greater than 0. `a` is a list with the first element being `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will contain `t + 2` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. `u` is now one less than its original value. `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.***
