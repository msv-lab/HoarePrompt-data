Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases`. Each 'YES' or 'NO' indicates whether the conditions checked in the loop for the corresponding tuple (n, m, k, a, b) were met. The conditions involve checking the unique elements in lists `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and ensuring the total number of distinct elements (those only in `a`, only in `b`, or in both) meets certain criteria.**
