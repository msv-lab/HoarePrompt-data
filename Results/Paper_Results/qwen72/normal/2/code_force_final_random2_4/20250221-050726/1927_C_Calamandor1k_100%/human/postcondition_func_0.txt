The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases` as input. Each tuple in `cases` consists of five elements: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers. The function evaluates each tuple to determine if the conditions related to the unique elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` are met. Specifically, it checks if the number of unique elements in `a` and `b` that are not shared and the number of shared elements together meet the criteria defined by `k`. The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple, indicating whether the conditions were met for that tuple.
