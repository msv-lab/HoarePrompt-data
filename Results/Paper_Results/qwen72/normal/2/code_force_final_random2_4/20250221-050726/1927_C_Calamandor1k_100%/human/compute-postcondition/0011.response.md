Output State: **All initial conditions remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.** 

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop body and proceed to the next iteration or the next statement outside the loop, depending on the context. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same.
