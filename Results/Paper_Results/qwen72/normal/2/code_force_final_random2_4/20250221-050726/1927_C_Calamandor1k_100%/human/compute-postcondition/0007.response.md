Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b), `results` is an empty list, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.** 

Explanation:
- The code `only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a` creates a new set `only_b` which contains elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `results`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`) remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects the updated value of `only_b` and retains the initial state of all other variables.
