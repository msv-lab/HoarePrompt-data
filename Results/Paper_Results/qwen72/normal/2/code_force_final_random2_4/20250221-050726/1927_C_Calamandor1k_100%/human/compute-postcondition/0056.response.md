Output State: **All variables (`t`, `cases`, `results`, `unique_a`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, `unique_b`) retain their initial values. If `len(only_b) > k // 2`, `results` now includes an additional element 'NO'. The program continues to the next iteration or statement if `len(only_a) > k // 2`. `total_distinct` is now equal to `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the total number of distinct elements by summing the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. This value is stored in the variable `total_distinct`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
