Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing `t` tuples (n, m, k, a, b), `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases` based on the conditions checked in the loop. For each tuple, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, and `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- `cases` retains its structure as a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the same elements as initially defined.
- `results` is now populated with 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases` based on the conditions evaluated in the loop.
- The sets `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` are computed for each tuple in `cases`.
- `total_distinct` is calculated for each tuple as the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.
- The final state of `results` reflects whether each tuple in `cases` meets the specified conditions, with 'YES' if it does and 'NO' if it does not.
