Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is n-1, `n` is the input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `tmp` is 0. If no `a` was 1, `bx` remains -1. If no `a` was 2, `ax` remains 1000000007. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is n-1, `n` is the input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `tmp` is 0 if the current value of `i` is outside the range [bx, ax]. If the current value of `i` is within the range [bx, ax], `tmp` is set to 1. If no `a` was 1, `bx` remains -1, and if no `a` was 2, `ax` remains 1000000007, with `bx` always being less than `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is n-1, n is the input integer, t is greater than 0, a and x are integers provided by user input, cx is a set containing at least one unique x value where a was neither 1 nor 2, ax is the minimum value of all x values where a was 2, bx is the maximum value of all x values where a was 1, tmp is 1 if the current value of i is outside the range [bx, ax] and 2 if the current value of i is within the range [bx, ax], i is the next value from the set cx.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_ is n-1, n is the input integer, t is greater than 0, a and x are integers provided by user input, cx is a set containing at least two unique x values where a was neither 1 nor 2, ax is the minimum value of all x values where a was 2, bx is the maximum value of all x values where a was 1, i is the next value from the set cx. If i is within the range [bx, ax], tmp is 3. Otherwise, tmp is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
