The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `cx`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cx`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must contain at least one more element, and `i` will take the value of the next element in `cx`.

At the end of the last iteration, `cx` must contain at least one element, and `i` was the last element in `cx`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must still contain at least one element, and `i` will now be the next (or first remaining) element in `cx`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` must contain at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.** 

However, to specifically reflect the adjustment for the next iteration:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
