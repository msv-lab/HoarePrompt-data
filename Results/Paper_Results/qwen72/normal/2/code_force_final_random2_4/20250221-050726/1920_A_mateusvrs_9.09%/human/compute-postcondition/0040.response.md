Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` must contain at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is 0, and the current value of `i` is such that `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**
