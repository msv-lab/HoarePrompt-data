The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `tmp` was 0 if the current value of `i` was outside the range `[bx, ax]`, and 1 if the current value of `i` was within the range `[bx, ax]`. Therefore, the new value of `tmp` will be 1 if the current value of `i` was outside the range `[bx, ax]`, and 2 if the current value of `i` was within the range `[bx, ax]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is n-1, `n` is the input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `tmp` is 1 if the current value of `i` was outside the range [bx, ax] and 2 if the current value of `i` was within the range [bx, ax], `i` is the next value from the set `cx`.**
