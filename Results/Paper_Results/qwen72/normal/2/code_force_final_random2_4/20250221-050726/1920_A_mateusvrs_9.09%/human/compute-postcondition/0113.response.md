The value of `x` is added to the set `cx`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `cx` was initially an empty set, it now contains the single element `x`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is a set containing `{x}`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `a` is not equal to 1, and `a` is not equal to 2.**
