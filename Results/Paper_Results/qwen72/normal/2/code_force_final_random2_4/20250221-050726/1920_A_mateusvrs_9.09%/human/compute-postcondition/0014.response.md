The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. The current value of `ax` is 1000000007, and `x` is an input integer. Since `x` can be any integer, the new value of `ax` will be the smaller of `x` and 1000000007. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is 2, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to 1.**
