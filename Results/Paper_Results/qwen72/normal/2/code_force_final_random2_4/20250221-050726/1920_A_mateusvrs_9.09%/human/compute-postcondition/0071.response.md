The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the initial value of `ax`. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `x` has been added to the collection `cx`. `ax` is now the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`.**
