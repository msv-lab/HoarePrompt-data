To determine what will be printed by the `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic behind the construction of the list `r`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 0, meaning all iterations have completed.
- `r` is a list containing the results of all test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2.
  - `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1.
  - `cx` contains all unique `x` values where `a` is 3.
  - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the corresponding element in `r` is 0.
  - Otherwise, the element in `r` is the count of valid `x` values in `cx` (those between `bx` and `ax`, inclusive) subtracted from the total possible values (`ax - bx + 1`).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **For each test case:**
   - Calculate `ax` as the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2.
   - Calculate `bx` as the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1.
   - Collect all unique `x` values where `a` is 3 into `cx`.
   - Determine the result for this test case:
     - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the result is 0.
     - Otherwise, the result is the count of valid `x` values in `cx` (those between `bx` and `ax`, inclusive) subtracted from the total possible values (`ax - bx + 1`).

2. **Construct the list `r`:**
   - Each element in `r` corresponds to the result of one test case as determined by the above logic.

3. **Print the list `r`:**
   - The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of `r` on a new line.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume we have the following data for simplicity:
- Test Case 1:
  - `x` values where `a` is 2: [5, 7, 9]
  - `x` values where `a` is 1: [3, 4, 6]
  - `x` values where `a` is 3: [4, 5, 6, 7]
  - `ax = min(5, 7, 9) = 5`
  - `bx = max(3, 4, 6) = 6`
  - Since `bx >= ax`, the result is 0.

- Test Case 2:
  - `x` values where `a` is 2: [10, 12, 15]
  - `x` values where `a` is 1: [8, 9, 11]
  - `x` values where `a` is 3: [9, 10, 11, 12]
  - `ax = min(10, 12, 15) = 10`
  - `bx = max(8, 9, 11) = 11`
  - Since `bx < ax`, the result is:
    - Total possible values: `10 - 11 + 1 = 0`
    - Valid `x` values in `cx` between 11 and 10: [10, 11]
    - Count of valid `x` values: 2
    - Result: `0 - 2 = -2`

### Final Output:
Given the above example, the list `r` would be `[0, -2]`. When the `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement is executed, it will print:

Output: **0
-2**
