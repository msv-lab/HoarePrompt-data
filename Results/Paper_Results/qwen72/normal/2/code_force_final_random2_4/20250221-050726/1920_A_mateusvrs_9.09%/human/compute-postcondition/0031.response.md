The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `t` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `_` is 1 (unchanged)
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `a` is an input integer (unchanged)
- `x` is an input integer (unchanged)
- `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 (unchanged)
- `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the original value of `bx` if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 (unchanged)
- `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `x`.

If `a` is 1 or 2, `cx` is initially an empty set. After executing `cx.add(x)`, `cx` will contain `x`.

If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` already contains `x`. Adding `x` again does not change the set.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the original value of `bx` if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` contains `x` if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `x` (unchanged).**
