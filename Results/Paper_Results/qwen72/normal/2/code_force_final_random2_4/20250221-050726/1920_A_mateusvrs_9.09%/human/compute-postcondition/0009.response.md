The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `a` and `x`.

- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` is -1.
- After executing the code, `a` and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**
