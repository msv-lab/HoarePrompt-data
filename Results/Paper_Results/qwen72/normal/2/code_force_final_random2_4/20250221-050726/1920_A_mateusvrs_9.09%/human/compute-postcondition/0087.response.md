To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `n` is 0.
- `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input.
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2.
- If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` contains all unique `x` values encountered where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.
- Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.
- `tmp` is 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in cx:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `cx` is not empty.
- The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which will take values from `cx`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `cx` must contain at least one element.
- The state of `i` will be determined by the elements in `cx` during each iteration.

### Final State:
- `cx` must contain at least one unique `x` value where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.
- `i` will be the first element in `cx` when the loop starts.

### State:
**`n` is 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a non-empty list of unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is 0, `i` is the first element in `cx`**
