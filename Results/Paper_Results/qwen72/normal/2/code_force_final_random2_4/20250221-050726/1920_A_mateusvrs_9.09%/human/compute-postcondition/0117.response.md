Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `x`.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `t`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged.
- The new values of `a` and `x` are determined by the user input, but their specific values are not known until the input is provided.
- The conditions for `a` and `x` (if `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and -1; if `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; if `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` is a set containing `{x}`) have not been applied yet, so the initial state of these variables remains the same.
