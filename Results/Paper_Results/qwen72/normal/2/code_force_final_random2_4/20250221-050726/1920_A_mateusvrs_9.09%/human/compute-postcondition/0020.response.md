The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `x`. This changes the values of `a` and `x` from their initial states. The initial conditions for `t`, `_`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise by the new values of `a` and `x`.

Let's analyze the impact:

1. `a` and `x` are reassigned based on the input.
2. The conditions for `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` depend on the new value of `a`:
   - If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and -1.
   - If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
   - If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` is updated to contain `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- `ax` is 1000000007
- `bx` is -1
- `cx` is an empty set

After executing the code:
- `a` and `x` are updated to the input values.
- Depending on the value of `a`, `bx`, `ax`, or `cx` may be updated.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `x`.**
