The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `x`. This impacts the initial state by updating the values of `a` and `x` based on the input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007
- `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the original value of `bx`
- `cx` is an empty set
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set
- If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` contains `x`

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` and `x` are updated with the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the original value of `bx` if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `x`.**
