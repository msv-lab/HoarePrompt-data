Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.***
