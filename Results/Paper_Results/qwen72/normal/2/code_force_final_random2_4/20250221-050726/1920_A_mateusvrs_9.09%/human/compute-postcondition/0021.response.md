Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the original value of `bx`, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `x`.** 

Explanation:
- `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and its original value (`-1` if `a` is not 1, otherwise the maximum of `x` and `-1`).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
