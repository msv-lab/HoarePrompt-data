The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial conditions, `cx` is initially an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise it contains `x`. After adding `x` to `cx`, the set `cx` will contain `x` regardless of the value of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` contains `x`.**
