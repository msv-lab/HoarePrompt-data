The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `tmp` was either 1 or 2, depending on whether the current value of `i` was outside or within the range `[bx, ax]`. After incrementing, `tmp` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or 3 if it was initially 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **_ is n-1, n is the input integer, t is greater than 0, a and x are integers provided by user input, cx is a set containing at least two unique x values where a was neither 1 nor 2, ax is the minimum value of all x values where a was 2, bx is the maximum value of all x values where a was 1, tmp is 2 if the current value of i is outside the range [bx, ax] and 3 if the current value of i is within the range [bx, ax], i is the next value from the set cx.**
