The only variable in the loop head is `numero_testes`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `numero_testes`. If `numero_testes` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numero_testes` must be greater than 1, and `func_1()` has been called twice. For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must still be greater than 0.

Since the loop counter `_` is not used and does not affect the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted. The number of times `func_1()` has been called is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must be greater than 0.
State: **`numero_testes` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called twice**
