The function `func_1()` is called, but since there is no information about what `func_1()` does, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the program state. However, the initial condition that `numero_testes` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged unless `func_1()` explicitly modifies it.

Output State: **`numero_testes` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called.**
