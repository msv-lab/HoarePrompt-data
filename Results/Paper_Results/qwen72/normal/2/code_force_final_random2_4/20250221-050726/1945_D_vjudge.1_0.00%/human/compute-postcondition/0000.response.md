The value of `numero_testes` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. Since the initial state specifies that `numero_testes` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, the new value of `numero_testes` must also satisfy this condition. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).**
