You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]

        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
    print(resultado)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `numero_testes` from the user input, which must be a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The function then calls `func_1` exactly `numero_testes` times. After the function concludes, `numero_testes` remains unchanged, and `func_1` has been executed the specified number of times. The primary purpose of `func_2` is to repeatedly execute `func_1` a user-specified number of times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Kirill starts at the end of a queue of `n` people.
   - He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - Moving to position `j` from position `i` (where `j < i`) costs `a_j` coins plus `b_k` coins for each `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` to make it easier to handle the positions from the end to the front.
   - It initializes `soma_b` to accumulate the cost of moving through positions and `pref` to store the total cost accumulated so far.
   - For each position from `n-k` to `n-1`, it calculates the minimum cost to move to the desired position.

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - `func_1` reads the number of people `n` and the target position `k`.
     - It reads the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` and reverses them.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - For the first `n-k` positions, it checks if moving to the current position is cheaper using `a_i` or `b_i`.
     - If `a_i` is cheaper, it adds the cost to `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds the cost to `soma_b`.
   - **Final Cost Calculation**:
     - For the remaining positions (`n-k` to `n-1`), it calculates the minimum cost to reach the target position by adding the current `soma_b` and `a_i` to `pref`.
   - **Output**:
     - It prints the minimum cost for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles the edge case where `n == m` correctly by ensuring that Kirill doesn't need to move if he is already in the first `m` positions.
   - It also handles the case where `n > m` by calculating the minimum cost to move to one of the first `m` positions.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. The algorithm is efficient and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
