Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `lista_B` is in its original order, `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed, `n - k` must be greater than 2, and the relationship between the first elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` is preserved (either `lista_A[0] < lista_B[0]` or `lista_A[0] >= lista_B[0]`). If `lista_A[2] < lista_B[2]`, `pref` is updated to `pref + lista_A[2]` and `soma_b` is 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is updated to `soma_b + lista_B[2]`.***
