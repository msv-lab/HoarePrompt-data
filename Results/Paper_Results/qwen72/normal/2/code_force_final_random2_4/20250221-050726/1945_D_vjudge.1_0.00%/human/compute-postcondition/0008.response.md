Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, given the context of the parameter constraint `numero_testes` being a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, the function likely performs operations or tests a certain number of times specified by `numero_testes`. Since no specific output is mentioned, the function's primary purpose may be to execute a process or test a specified number of times without returning a result.**
