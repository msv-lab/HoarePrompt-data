The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i`, and the expression `n - k`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n - k` is greater than 0 because `n` is greater than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n - k` must still be greater than `i`.

Since `i` was 0, after incrementing it by 1, `i` becomes 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n - k`. Therefore, `n - k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `lista_B` is in its original order, `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed, `soma_b` is either 0 or the first element of `lista_B`, `pref` is either 0 or the first element of `lista_A`, and the relationship between the first elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` is preserved (either `lista_A[0] < lista_B[0]` or `lista_A[0] >= lista_B[0]`), `n - k` must be greater than 1**
