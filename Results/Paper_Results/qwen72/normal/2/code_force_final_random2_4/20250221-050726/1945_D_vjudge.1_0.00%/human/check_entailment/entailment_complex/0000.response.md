Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format as described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases (`numero_testes`) and then processes each test case individually by calling `func_1`.

2. **Reversing Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This is a key step because the algorithm works by considering the positions from the end of the queue (where Kirill starts) to the front. Reversing the lists allows the algorithm to process these positions in a straightforward manner.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The algorithm initializes `soma_b` to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative cost of bribing people in the positions between the current position and the target position.
   - The first loop iterates from `0` to `n - k - 1` (exclusive), calculating the cost of moving Kirill to a position within the first `k` positions. If the cost to move to a position `j` (represented by `a_i`) is less than the cost to bribe the people in between (represented by `b_i`), the algorithm adds the cost to `pref` and resets `soma_b`. Otherwise, it adds the cost to `soma_b`.
   - The second loop iterates from `n - k` to `n - 1` (inclusive), calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `k` positions. It updates `resultado` with the minimum cost found.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the expected output format.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n == k` (Kirill is already in the first `k` positions).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
