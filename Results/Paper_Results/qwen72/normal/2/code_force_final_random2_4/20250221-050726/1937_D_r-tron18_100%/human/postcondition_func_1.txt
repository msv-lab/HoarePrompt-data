The function `func_2` takes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5. It computes a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` represents a specific value derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After computing these values, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The final state of the program is that `ans` contains the computed values for each position in the string `s1`, and these values are printed to the console.
