The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1` and `n`. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5. The function returns a result based on the content of `s1`.

Since the output description is not provided, I will infer the most likely functionality based on common operations involving such strings.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5. It returns a result based on the pattern of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`.**
