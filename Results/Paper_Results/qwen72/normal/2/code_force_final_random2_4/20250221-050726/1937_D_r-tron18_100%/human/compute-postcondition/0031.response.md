To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

1. **Identify the function calls and their parameters:**
   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)`
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`

2. **Understand the function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, but it appears to be a function that takes a list and an index and returns some value. For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume it returns the value at the specified index in the list.

3. **Evaluate the function calls:**
   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)`: This call will return the value at index `ol + 1` in the list `suffZero`.
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`: This call will return the value at index 1 in the list `suffZero`.

4. **Calculate the values:**
   - `suffZero` is a list with elements `[0, n]`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` will return `n` because `ol + 1` is the second index in the list `[0, n]`.
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` will return `0` because the first index in the list `[0, n]` is 0.

5. **Compute `zeroInd`:**
   - `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`
   - `zeroInd = 2 * n - 0`
   - `zeroInd = 2 * n`

6. **Update the output state:**
   - The only variable that changes is `zeroInd`, which is now `2 * n`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, n], `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * n`.**
