To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

2. **Evaluate the Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet assigns the result of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` to `zeroInd`.
   - `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments: `suffZero` and `ol`.
   - `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.

3. **Determine the Impact of `func_1`:**
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact output. However, we know that `suffZero` is `[0]` and `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - Let's assume `func_1(suffZero, ol)` returns a value `x`. Therefore, `zeroInd` will be `2 * x`.

4. **Update the Variables:**
   - The only variable that changes is `zeroInd`, which is now `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

### Output State:
The output state is:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.**
