Output State: **`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` has one fewer element, and if `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, then `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne - 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` (with `preOne[-1]` now referring to the new last element), and `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne - 1) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))` (with `preOne[-1]` now referring to the new last element). Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, and `ans[n - 3]` is `2 * suffZero[-1] - 2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) + func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1` (with `preOne` having one fewer element).**

Explanation:
- `totalOne` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `totalOne - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged, except for the updated value of `totalOne` which affects the calculations involving `totalOne`.
