Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains [0, `i + 1`], `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1, `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]` assigns the value `2 * preOne[-1]` to the variable `oneInd`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `preOne[-1]` is the last element of `preOne`, which is the cumulative sum of all elements in `pre`.
- Therefore, `oneInd` is twice the cumulative sum of all elements in `pre`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
