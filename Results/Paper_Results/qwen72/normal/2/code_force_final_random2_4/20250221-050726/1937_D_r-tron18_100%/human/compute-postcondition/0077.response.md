Output State: **`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `suffZero` has a new element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero` to `zeroInd`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
