Output State: **`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `el = s1[i]` assigns the value of the third-to-last character of the string `s1` to the variable `el`.
- The value of `i` is `n - 3`, which is the index of the third-to-last character in `s1`.
- No other variables are affected by this assignment, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.
