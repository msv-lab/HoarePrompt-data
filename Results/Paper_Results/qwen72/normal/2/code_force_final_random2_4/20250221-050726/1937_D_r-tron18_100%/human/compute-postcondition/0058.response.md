Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains [0, `i + 1`], `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0. If `zr` (length of `suffZero` minus 1) is less than or equal to `ol` (equal to `totalOne`), then `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
