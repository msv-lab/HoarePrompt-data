### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it meets the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly. Let's break down the logic and verify each part:

1. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with characters `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell moves left or right based on the character and inverts the character after moving.
   - We need to compute how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(arr, times)`**: This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at a specific position, ensuring the index does not go out of bounds. This function is used to help compute the required values in `func_2`.

   - **`func_2(s1, n)`**: This function processes the string `s1` and computes the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
     - **Preprocessing:**
       - `pre` stores the indices of `>` characters.
       - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre` with an initial value of 0.
       - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]` and will store the cumulative sum of indices of `<` characters from the end.
     - **Main Loop:**
       - Iterates from the end of the string to the beginning.
       - For each character, it updates the `ans` list with the calculated time.
       - Uses `func_1` to compute the necessary values based on the positions of `>` and `<` characters.
       - Adjusts `preOne` and `totalOne` as it processes each character.

3. **Verification:**
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - **Single Character Grid:** The program should handle grids of length 1 correctly.
     - **All `<` or All `>`:** The program should handle grids with all `<` or all `>` characters correctly.
     - **Mixed Characters:** The program should handle mixed characters correctly, ensuring the pinball's movement and inversion are accurately simulated.

   - **Correctness of Logic:**
     - The program correctly identifies the positions of `>` and `<` characters.
     - It uses prefix sums and suffix sums to efficiently compute the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The logic for updating `ans` based on the positions and counts of `>` and `<` characters is sound.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case as required.

Given the detailed analysis and verification of the program's logic and handling of edge cases, the program appears to meet the problem description and requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
