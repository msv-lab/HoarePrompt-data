Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is -1, `el` is the first character of `s1`, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is empty, `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the 1-based indices of all '<' characters in `s1`, and `ans` contains the computed values for each position in the string `s1`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from the last character to the first character of the string `s1`.
- After the loop completes, `i` is -1 because the loop runs until `i` reaches -1.
- `el` is the first character of `s1` because the loop processes each character in reverse order.
- `totalOne` is 0 because the loop decrements `totalOne` each time it encounters a '>' character, and all '>' characters are processed by the end of the loop.
- `preOne` is empty because each time a '>' character is encountered, the last element of `preOne` is removed, and all '>' characters are processed.
- `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the 1-based indices of all '<' characters in `s1`, as each '<' character adds its index plus one to the `suffZero` list.
- `ans` contains the computed values for each position in the string `s1`, as the loop updates `ans` based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
