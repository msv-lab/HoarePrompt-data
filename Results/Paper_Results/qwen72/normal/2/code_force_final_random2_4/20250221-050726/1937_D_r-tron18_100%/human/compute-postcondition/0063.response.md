Output State: **`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `el` remains the third-to-last character of `s1`.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 3`.
- The value of `ol` remains `totalOne`.
- The value of `zr` remains `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- A new variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`. The function `func_1` is called with `suffZero` and `totalOne` as arguments, and the result is multiplied by 2 to get the final value of `zeroInd`.
