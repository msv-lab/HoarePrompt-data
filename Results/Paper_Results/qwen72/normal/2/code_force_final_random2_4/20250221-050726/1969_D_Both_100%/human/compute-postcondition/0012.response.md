To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is typically used as a placeholder when the value of the iterator is not needed within the loop body. 

Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `_` should start at 0, as it is the typical starting point for such a loop.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.**
