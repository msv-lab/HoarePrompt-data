The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `_` is `k-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0, and `_` should increment by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from the original `combined` list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop execution.**
