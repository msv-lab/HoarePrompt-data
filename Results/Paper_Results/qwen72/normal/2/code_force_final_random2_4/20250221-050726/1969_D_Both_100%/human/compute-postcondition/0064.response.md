To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is `k-1`.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from the original `combined` list.
   - `remaining_items` is an empty list.
   - `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`.
   - `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `combined` is an empty list.
   - `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop execution.

2. **Key Points:**
   - `max_profit` is determined by the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop execution.
   - The exact values of `current_profit` are not provided, but it is clear that `max_profit` is the highest value among these.

3. **Explanation:**
   - Since the exact values of `current_profit` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `max_profit`.
   - However, based on the structure of the problem, `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.

Given this information, the `print(max_profit)` statement will output the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum value of current_profit observed during the loop execution)**
