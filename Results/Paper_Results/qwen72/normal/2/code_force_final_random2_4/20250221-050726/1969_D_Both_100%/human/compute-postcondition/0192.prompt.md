Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`k` is 0, `_` is -1. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined`, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, and `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `combined` is empty, `heap` remains unchanged and `current_profit` remains unchanged. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. The state of `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `max_profit` (before the update) remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is now one element shorter than before, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined` except the last one, sorted according to the second element of each tuple. `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` adjusted by either subtracting `item[1]` if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or adding `item[0]` if the sum is less than 0. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is further decreased by `removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than the original `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged, and `removed_item` is the item that was removed from `heap` and replaced by `item` (if `removed_item` is not None).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is now two elements shorter than before, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined` except the last two, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted as follows: if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]` twice; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]` twice. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is further decreased by `removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged, and `removed_item` is the item that was removed from `heap` and replaced by `item` (if `removed_item` is not None).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is now three elements shorter than before and must still contain at least one element, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined` except the last three, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, `item` is the new last element that was removed from `combined`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]` twice; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]` twice. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is further decreased by `removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged, `removed_item` is the item that was removed from `heap` and replaced by the new `item` (if `removed_item` is not None). If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
