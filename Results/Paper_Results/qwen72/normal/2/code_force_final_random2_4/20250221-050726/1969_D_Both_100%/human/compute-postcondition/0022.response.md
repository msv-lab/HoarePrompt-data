Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains the `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k` elements shorter.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `_` will be equal to `k-1`.
- The `heap` will contain the `k` tuples with the highest second elements from the original `combined` list.
- The `combined` list will be `len(combined) - k` elements shorter, as the top `k` elements have been moved to the `heap`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `remaining_items`) will retain their initial values or states as they were not modified within the loop.
