The function `func_4` accepts the following parameters:
- `test_cases`: A positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: A non-negative integer.
- `k`: A non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `prices`: A list of integers representing the prices Alice pays for the items.
- `bonuses`: A list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for the items, where both `prices` and `bonuses` have the same length `n`.

The function returns different outputs based on the input values:
- Case_1: If `k` is 0, the function returns the sum of all elements in the `prices` list.
- Case_2: If `k` is greater than 0, the function returns the sum of the first `k` elements in the `prices` list plus the sum of the first `k` elements in the `bonuses` list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept the parameters `test_cases`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses`, and return the sum of the first `k` elements in the `prices` list plus the sum of the first `k` elements in the `bonuses` list if `k` is greater than 0. If `k` is 0, it returns the sum of all elements in the `prices` list.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `test_cases`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses`. If `k` is 0, it returns the sum of all elements in the `prices` list. If `k` is greater than 0, it returns the sum of the first `k` elements in the `prices` list plus the sum of the first `k` elements in the `bonuses` list.**
