The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `_` is 1. If `combined` is true, `combined` is a list with one less element, and `heap` contains one additional element.**
