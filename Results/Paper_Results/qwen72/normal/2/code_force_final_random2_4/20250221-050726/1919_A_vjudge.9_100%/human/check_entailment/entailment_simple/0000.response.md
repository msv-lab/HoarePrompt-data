Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the game problem by determining the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. The logic hinges on the observation that the game state transitions in such a way that the parity of the difference between the number of coins in the wallets remains constant throughout the game. This is because each player, on their turn, can either swap wallets (which does not change the difference in the number of coins) or remove one coin from their wallet (which changes the difference by 1, preserving its parity).

Given this, the program checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd:
- If the difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), Bob wins because the game will eventually reach a state where both players have the same number of coins, and the player whose turn it is will be forced to make a move that leads to a loss.
- If the difference is odd, Alice wins because she can always force the game into a state where the difference is even, putting Bob in a losing position.

The program correctly implements this logic and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, processes each case by reading the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and prints the correct winner based on the parity of the difference.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
