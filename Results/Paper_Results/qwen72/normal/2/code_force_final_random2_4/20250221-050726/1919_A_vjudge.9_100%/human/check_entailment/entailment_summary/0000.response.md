Reasoning:  
The logic of the program is based on the observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. This is because the game involves alternating moves where each player can either swap wallets or keep their own, followed by removing one coin. The key insight is that if the difference in the number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's strategy, ensuring he never loses. Conversely, if the difference is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by playing optimally.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`. If the condition is true, it prints "Bob", indicating that Bob will win. Otherwise, it prints "Alice", indicating that Alice will win. The program processes each test case as expected and matches the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
