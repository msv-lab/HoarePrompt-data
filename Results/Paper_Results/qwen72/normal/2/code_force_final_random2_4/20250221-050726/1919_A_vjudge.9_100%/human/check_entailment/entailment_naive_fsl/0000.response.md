Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the solution incorrectly determines the winner based solely on whether the difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd. This approach fails to account for the actual game mechanics, where players can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallets, and then remove a coin.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
- Input: `a = 2`, `b = 2`

According to the provided solution:
- `abs(2 - 2) % 2 == 0`, so the output would be "Bob".

However, the correct outcome should be "Alice" because:
1. Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob also has 2 coins.
2. Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, resulting in `a = 2` and `b = 2` (no change).
3. Alice removes a coin from her wallet, resulting in `a = 1` and `b = 2`.
4. Bob can choose to swap wallets with Alice, resulting in `a = 2` and `b = 1`.
5. Bob removes a coin from his wallet, resulting in `a = 2` and `b = 0`.
6. Alice can now swap wallets with Bob, resulting in `a = 0` and `b = 2`.
7. Alice removes a coin from her wallet, but since she has 0 coins, she cannot make a move, and Bob wins.

This example shows that the provided solution does not correctly simulate the game and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
