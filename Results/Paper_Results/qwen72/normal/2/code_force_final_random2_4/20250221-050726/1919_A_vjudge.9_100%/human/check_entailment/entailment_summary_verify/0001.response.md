### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution step by step.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules:**
   - Players take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each turn consists of two steps:
     1. Choose to swap wallets or keep the current one.
     2. Remove 1 coin from the current wallet (if possible).
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key to winning is to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (i.e., \(a = b\)), the player whose turn it is will lose because they cannot make a valid move without making the other player win in the next turn.
   - If the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player with more coins can always force the game into a state where the other player loses.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The game can be reduced to a parity problem. If the difference between the number of coins in the wallets is even, Bob will win because he can always mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice will win because she can always force Bob into a losing position.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins \(a\) and \(b\) in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
- It checks if the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

#### Verification:
- The logic of the program aligns with the mathematical insight derived from the problem.
- The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.
- The program's decision-making process (checking the parity of the difference) is correct and matches the optimal strategy for the game.

However, there is a subtle issue in the original assessment and the program logic. The program checks the parity of the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\), but the correct condition should be based on the parity of the sum of \(a\) and \(b\).

#### Correct Condition:
- If the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is even, Bob will win because he can always mirror Alice's moves.
- If the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, Alice will win because she can always force Bob into a losing position.

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it checks the parity of the absolute difference instead of the sum of the coins. The corrected program, which checks the parity of the sum, is the correct solution.

Final: **False**
