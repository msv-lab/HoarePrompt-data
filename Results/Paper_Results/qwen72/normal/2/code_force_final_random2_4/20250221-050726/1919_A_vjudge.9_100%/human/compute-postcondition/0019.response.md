The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers within specified ranges.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.

The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each case. Since the specific output is not detailed, we can only infer that the function returns some form of result based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a` and `b`.**
