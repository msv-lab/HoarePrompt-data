You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `t` is equal to the initial value, `i` is `t-1`, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input for the last iteration. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t-1`, and `a` and `b` hold the values from the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. Let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules:**
   - Players take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each turn consists of two steps:
     1. Choose to swap wallets or keep the current one.
     2. Remove 1 coin from the current wallet (if possible).
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key to winning is to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (i.e., \(a = b\)), the player whose turn it is will lose because they cannot make a valid move without making the other player win in the next turn.
   - If the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player with more coins can always force the game into a state where the other player loses.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The game can be reduced to a parity problem. If the difference between the number of coins in the wallets is even, Bob will win because he can always mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice will win because she can always force Bob into a losing position.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins \(a\) and \(b\) in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
- It checks if the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

#### Verification:
- The logic of the program aligns with the mathematical insight derived from the problem.
- The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.
- The program's decision-making process (checking the parity of the difference) is correct and matches the optimal strategy for the game.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
