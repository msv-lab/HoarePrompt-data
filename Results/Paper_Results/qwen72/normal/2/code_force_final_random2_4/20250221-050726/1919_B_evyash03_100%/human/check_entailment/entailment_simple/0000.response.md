Reasoning:  
The given program aims to solve the problem by calculating the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters in the input string `expression`. However, this approach does not correctly implement the required logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty (sum of penalties of all subarrays) is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The current implementation simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of "+" and "-" characters, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. For example, in the case where `expression` is `"+-+-+"`, the optimal way to split it would be `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`, but the program would return `1` (which is the absolute difference between the counts of "+" and "-" characters).

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
