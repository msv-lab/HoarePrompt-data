The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string consisting only of characters "+" and "-", and `length` is a positive integer indicating the length of the string, where 1 <= length <= 5000. The function returns the absolute difference between the number of "-" characters and the number of "+" characters in the string `expression`.
