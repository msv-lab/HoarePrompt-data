The code snippet `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. This impacts the `results` list, which previously contained elements based on certain conditions. After executing this code, `'yes'` is added to the end of the `results` list.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` now contains elements based on the conditions described in the initial state plus the string 'yes'. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, then 'no' is added to `results`, and 'yes' is also added to `results`. Otherwise, 'yes' is added to `results` and the contents of `results` remain otherwise unchanged.**
