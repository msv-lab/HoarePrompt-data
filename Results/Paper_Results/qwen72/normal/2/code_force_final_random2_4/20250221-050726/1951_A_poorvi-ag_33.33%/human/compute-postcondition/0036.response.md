Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` now contains elements based on the conditions described in the initial state plus either 'no' or 'yes'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, 'yes' is added to `results`. Otherwise, 'no' is added to `results`.***
