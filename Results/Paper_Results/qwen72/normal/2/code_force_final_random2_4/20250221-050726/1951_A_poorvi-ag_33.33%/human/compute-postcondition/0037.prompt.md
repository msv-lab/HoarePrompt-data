Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start and end are integers where start <= end, representing the range of folder names to be processed. The current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files. `t` is an input integer. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
        results.append('no')
    if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        else:
            results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even and `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, then `results` contains two elements 'no'. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even but does not meet the exact condition of having exactly two '1's and '11' being a substring, then `results` contains the string 'yes'. If the number of '1's in `arr` is not even, then `results` contains one element 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` contains elements based on the conditions described in the initial state. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, the string 'yes' is added to `results`. Otherwise, the string 'no' is added to `results`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` now contains elements based on the conditions described in the initial state plus either 'no' or 'yes'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, 'yes' is added to `results`. Otherwise, 'no' is added to `results`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
