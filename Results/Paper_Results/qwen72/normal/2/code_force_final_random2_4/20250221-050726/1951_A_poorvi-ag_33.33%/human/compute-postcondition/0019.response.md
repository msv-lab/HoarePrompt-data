Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `results` contains elements based on the conditions described in the initial state.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies the conditions for `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `results`.
- The code snippet `arr = input()` assigns the user input to the variable `arr`.
- The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The content of `results` is determined based on the conditions described in the initial state, which are not affected by the assignment of `arr`.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated value of `arr`.
