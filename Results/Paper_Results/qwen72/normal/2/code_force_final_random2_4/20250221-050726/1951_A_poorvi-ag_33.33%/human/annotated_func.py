#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers where start <= end, and they represent the range of folder names to be processed. The current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        
        if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
            if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
                results.append('no')
            else:
                results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described in the initial state. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's and does not contain exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, 'yes' is added to `results`. Otherwise, 'no' is added to `results`.
    for r in results:
        print(r)
        
    #State: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is the total number of iterations and must be at least 1, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described in the initial state. The loop has completed all iterations, and all elements in `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of inputs and processes them to determine if certain conditions are met. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `arr`. It then checks if the string `arr` meets specific criteria related to the count and arrangement of '1's. Based on these criteria, it appends 'yes' or 'no' to a list called `results`. Finally, it prints each element in `results`. The function does not modify any external state or files; it only processes the input data and prints the results.
