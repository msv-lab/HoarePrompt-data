Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Variable `c` Initialization**: The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. This initialization is incorrect and should not be part of the solution.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The calculation `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The term `- s * s / 2` does not make sense in the context of calculating the total cost of purchasing tickets. The correct approach should be to simply add the cost of the tickets purchased on each day to the total cost.

3. **Handling of Ticket Prices Increase**: The solution does not correctly handle the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a particular day. The problem states that if `x` tickets are purchased on day `i`, the prices for subsequent days will increase by `x`. This logic is missing from the provided solution.

4. **Early Termination**: The loop should terminate early once all `k` tickets have been purchased, but the current implementation continues to iterate through the entire list of days even if `k` becomes zero.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        
        total_cost = 0
        day = 0
        
        while k > 0:
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            total_cost += tickets_to_buy * l[day]
            k -= tickets_to_buy
            day += 1
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Initializes `total_cost` to 0.
- Uses a while loop to continue purchasing tickets until `k` becomes 0.
- Correctly calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets bought on each day by the price on that day.
- Increments the day counter after each purchase to move to the next day.
