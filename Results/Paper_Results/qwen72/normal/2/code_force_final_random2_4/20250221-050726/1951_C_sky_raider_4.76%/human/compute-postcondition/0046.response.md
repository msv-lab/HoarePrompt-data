Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is 0, and `c` is `k * k / 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `k * k / 2` to the variable `c`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `s`) remain unchanged. The value of `c` is now specifically `k * k / 2`.
