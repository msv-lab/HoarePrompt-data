The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (This condition is not directly relevant to the current code snippet, as the input is split and assigned to multiple variables, not a single integer.)

After executing the code:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input, each greater than 0.**
