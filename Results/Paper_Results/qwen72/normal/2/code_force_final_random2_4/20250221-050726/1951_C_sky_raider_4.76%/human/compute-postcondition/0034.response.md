Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `k` is now equal to `k - s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `m` remains an input integer.
- The value of `k` remains `k - s`.
- The value of `l` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- The value of `s` remains the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `l[1] * s - s * s / 2` to its previous value, which was `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`. Therefore, the new value of `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`.
