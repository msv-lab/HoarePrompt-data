Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the calculation of the total cost. Specifically, the variable `c` is initialized with `k * k / 2`, which is not part of the problem's requirements. Additionally, the formula used to update `c` inside the loop (`c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`) is incorrect and does not reflect the correct logic for calculating the total cost based on the problem's constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should work correctly:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        total_cost = 0
        for price in l:
            if k <= 0:
                break
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            total_cost += tickets_to_buy * price
            k -= tickets_to_buy
        print(total_cost)
```

This version correctly calculates the total cost by sorting the prices and buying the cheapest available tickets first, ensuring that the total cost is minimized. It also handles the constraints of purchasing no more than `m` tickets per day and the requirement to buy exactly `k` tickets.
