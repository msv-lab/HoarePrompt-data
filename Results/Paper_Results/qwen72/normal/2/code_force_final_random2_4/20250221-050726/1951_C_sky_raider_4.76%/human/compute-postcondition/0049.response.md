The value of `k` is updated by subtracting the value of `s` from it. Since `s` is defined as `min(m, k)`, the new value of `k` will be `k - min(m, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2`**
