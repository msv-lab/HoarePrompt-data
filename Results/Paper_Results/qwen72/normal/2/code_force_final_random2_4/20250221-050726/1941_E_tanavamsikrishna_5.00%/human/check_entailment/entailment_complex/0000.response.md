### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** A list `row` representing the depths of the river cells in a row, and an integer `d` representing the maximum distance between supports.
   - **Process:**
     - The first `d-1` elements of `row` are incremented by 1 to account for the cost of installing supports.
     - For each subsequent element starting from index `d-1`, the function sets the value to the minimum of the previous `d+1` elements plus the current value plus 1. This ensures that the cost of installing supports is minimized while maintaining the required distance constraint.
   - **Output:** The function returns the value of the last element in the modified `row`, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** Four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` representing the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance between supports, respectively. It also reads `n` rows of river depths.
   - **Process:**
     - It calls `func_1` for each row to compute the cost of installing supports for that row.
     - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of every possible contiguous subsequence of `k` rows.
     - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among these subsequences.
   - **Output:** The minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly increments the first `d-1` elements and computes the minimum cost for the rest of the elements, ensuring the distance constraint is met.
  - The final cost returned is the total cost of installing supports for the row, which is correct.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes each row using `func_1`.
  - It correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and finds the minimum total cost.
  - The output is the minimum total cost, which is the expected result.
