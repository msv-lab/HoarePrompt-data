To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop's ability to run, specifically the variables and expressions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: This is the loop variable.
   - `len(costs)`: This is the length of the `costs` list.
   - `k`: This is an integer that affects the range of the loop.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range is non-empty, i.e., `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0.
   - This can be rewritten as: `len(costs) > k - 1`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
   - The initial value of `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the loop.

### Final Adjusted State:
Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6, a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0.
- `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` on the corresponding row in `rows` with the parameter `d`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.

We need to ensure:
- `len(costs) >= k` to make sure the loop can execute at least once.
- `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6, a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0. `costs` is a list of length `n` where `len(costs) >= k`. `total_costs` is an empty list. `i` is 0.**
