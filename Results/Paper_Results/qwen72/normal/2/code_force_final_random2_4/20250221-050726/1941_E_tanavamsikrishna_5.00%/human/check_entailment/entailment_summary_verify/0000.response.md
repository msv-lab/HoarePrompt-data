### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and the problem requirements step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Support Placement**: Supports must be installed in the first and last columns of the chosen row.
2. **Distance Constraint**: The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

#### Function Analysis:

**Function 1: `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`**
- This function is responsible for calculating the minimum cost to place supports in a single row while adhering to the distance constraint `d`.
- The function iterates through the row and updates the cost for each cell.
- The key part of the function is the line:
  ```python
  row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
  ```
  - This line ensures that the cost of placing a support in cell `i` is the minimum cost of placing a support in any of the previous `d` cells plus the cost of the current cell plus 1.
  - This effectively enforces the distance constraint `d`.

**Function 2: `func_2()`**
- This function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
- It then reads `n` rows of the river grid.
- It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
- It finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and prints this cost.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program does not handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- The assessment provides a specific case where the program fails: for a row with depths `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0]` and `d = 2`, the correct placement should be at indices 0, 2, and 4, resulting in a cost of 5. However, the current implementation might incorrectly calculate the cost or place supports incorrectly.

#### Verification:
- Let's verify the specific case provided in the original assessment:
  - Row: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0]`
  - Distance constraint: `d = 2`
  - Expected cost: 5 (supports at indices 0, 2, and 4)

  Running `func_1` with this input:
  ```python
  row = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
  d = 2
  print(func_1(row, d))
  ```

  Step-by-step calculation:
  - Initialize: `row = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]`
  - First pass (i = 0): `row[0] = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - Second pass (i = 1): `row[1] = min([]) + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Third pass (i = 2): `row[2] = min([1]) + 2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4`
  - Fourth pass (i = 3): `row[3] = min([1, 2]) + 3 + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5`
  - Fifth pass (i = 4): `row[4] = min([1, 2, 4]) + 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`

  Final `row`: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 2]`
  - The cost for the row is `row[-1] = 2`, which is incorrect.

  The issue lies in the fact that the function does not correctly handle the distance constraint. The minimum cost should be 5, but the function returns 2.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the distance constraint between supports, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
