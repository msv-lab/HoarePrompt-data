Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `min(n, m) >= 4`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`, `b` is 4.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Since `b` is 4, this expression simplifies to `(n + 4) // 16`. The new value of `ans` is therefore `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`. All other variables remain unchanged.
