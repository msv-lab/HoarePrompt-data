The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `n`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `T`) remain unchanged. The condition `min(n, m) >= 2` and `t > 1` are still valid. The previous value of `ans` was `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, but now it is simply `n`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n`.**
