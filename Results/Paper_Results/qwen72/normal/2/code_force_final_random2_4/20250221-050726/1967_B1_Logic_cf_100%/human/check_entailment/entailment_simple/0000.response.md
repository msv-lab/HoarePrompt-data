Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Loop through possible values of \( b \):**
   - The loop iterates from \( b = 2 \) to \( \min(n, m) \).
   - For each \( b \), it updates `ans` using the formula `ans += (n + b) // (b * b)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Formula:**
  - The formula used in the loop `ans += (n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The correct approach should involve checking for each pair \((a, b)\) whether \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
- For each \( b \) from 1 to \( m \):
  - For each \( a \) from 1 to \( n \):
    - Check if \( (a + b) \% (b * \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \).
    - If true, increment the count.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. The formula used in the loop is incorrect and does not match the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
