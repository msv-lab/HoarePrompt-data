The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` and `m` are integers with `min(n, m) >= 2`.
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `T` is 2.
- `ans` is `n`.
- `b` is 2.

Let's calculate the new value of `ans`:

1. The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` simplifies to `(n + 2) // 4`.
2. Since `b` is 2, `b * b` is 4.
3. The value of `ans` is initially `n`.
4. The new value of `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `b` is 2.**
