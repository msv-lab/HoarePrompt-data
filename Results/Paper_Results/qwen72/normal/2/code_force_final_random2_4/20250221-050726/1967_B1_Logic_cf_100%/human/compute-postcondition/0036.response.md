To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are integers with `min(n, m) >= 2`.
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `T` is 2.
- `ans` is calculated as `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.
- `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `min(n, m)`**:
   - Let's denote `min(n, m)` as `k`. Since `min(n, m) >= 2`, `k` is at least 2.

2. **Calculate the sum in the expression for `ans`**:
   - The sum is calculated as `sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, k + 1))`.
   - This means we need to evaluate `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `k`.

3. **Evaluate the sum**:
   - For each `b` in the range from 2 to `k`, compute `(n + b) // (b * b)`.
   - The result of this division is an integer because of the floor division operator `//`.

4. **Sum the results**:
   - Sum all the integer results obtained from the above step.

5. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - `ans` is then `n +` the sum calculated in the previous step.

6. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - The final value of `ans` is the sum of `n` and the sum of the integer divisions.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 5` and `m = 3` (so `k = 3`):
- The sum is `sum((5 + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, 4))`.
- For `b = 2`: `(5 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 7 // 4 = 1`.
- For `b = 3`: `(5 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 8 // 9 = 0`.
- The sum is `1 + 0 = 1`.
- Therefore, `ans = 5 + 1 = 6`.

### General Case:
For any `n` and `m` where `min(n, m) = k`:
- The sum is `sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, k + 1))`.
- `ans = n +` this sum.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n` and the sum of the integer divisions as described.

Output: **ans (where ans is n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)))**
