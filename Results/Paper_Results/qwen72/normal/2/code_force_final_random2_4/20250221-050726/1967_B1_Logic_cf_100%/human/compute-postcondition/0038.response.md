The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the context provided, it seems that the function might require `n` and `m` as inputs, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since the function definition does not include these parameters, it is assumed that they are either global variables or passed through some other means (e.g., class attributes, environment variables).

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature and the absence of a clear output description, I cannot provide a precise functionality statement. However, if we assume that `n` and `m` are indeed inputs to the function, the functionality could be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates on two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The specific output or behavior of the function is not provided, so the exact functionality cannot be determined from the given information.**

If you can provide more details about the expected output or behavior of the function, I can refine this description.
