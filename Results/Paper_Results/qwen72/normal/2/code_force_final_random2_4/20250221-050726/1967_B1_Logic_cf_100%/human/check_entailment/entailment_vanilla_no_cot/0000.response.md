Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the calculation `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` does not accurately count the number of valid pairs (a, b) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This version iterates through all possible pairs (a, b) and checks if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. If it is, the pair is counted. This approach ensures that the solution is correct but may be inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). For better performance, a more optimized approach would be needed, but this version correctly implements the logic described in the problem.
