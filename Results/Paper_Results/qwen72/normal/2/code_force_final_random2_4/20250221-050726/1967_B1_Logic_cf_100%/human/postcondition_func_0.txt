The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and adds to it the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all integers `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. Finally, it prints the calculated value `ans` for each test case. After the function completes, the input values `t`, `n`, and `m` are consumed, and the function has no side effects other than printing the results.
