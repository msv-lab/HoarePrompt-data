Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the input values, `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`**

Explanation:
- `n` and `m` are converted from strings to integers.
- The values of `min(n, m)`, `t`, `T`, `ans`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The condition `min(n, m) >= 2` still holds true because the conversion from string to integer does not affect the values of `n` and `m`.
