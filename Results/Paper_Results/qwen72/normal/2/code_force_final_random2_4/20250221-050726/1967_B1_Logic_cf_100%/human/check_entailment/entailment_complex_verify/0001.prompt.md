You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` are integers with `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is the input integer, `T` is `t - 1`, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, and `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and adds to it the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all integers `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. Finally, it prints the calculated value `ans` for each test case. After the function completes, the input values `t`, `n`, and `m` are consumed, and the function has no side effects other than printing the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - Additionally, \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Initial Count:**
   - The program initializes the answer `ans` to \(n\). This is because for \(b = 1\), any \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\) will satisfy the condition since \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

4. **Loop for \(b > 1\):**
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it updates `ans` by adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\).

5. **Analysis of the Condition:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly handled in the program.
   - The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(b\).

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - For a given \(b\), we need to count the number of \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This requires checking the divisibility condition for each \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
