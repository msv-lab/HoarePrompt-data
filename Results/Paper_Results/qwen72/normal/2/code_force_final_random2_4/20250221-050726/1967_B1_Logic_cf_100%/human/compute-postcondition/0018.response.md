The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(n + 2) // 4`. Since `ans` was initially equal to `n`, the new value of `ans` becomes `n + (n + 2) // 4`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `T`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `b` is 2**
