Postcondition: ***`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a non-empty list, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appeared before sorting, `i` is 2, and `len(digits)` must be greater than 2. Additionally, either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`. If `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`, the program returns False. If `i` is less than `len(letters)` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
