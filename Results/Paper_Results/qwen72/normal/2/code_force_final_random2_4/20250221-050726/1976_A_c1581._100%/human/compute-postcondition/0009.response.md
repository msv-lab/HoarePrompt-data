The code appends the value of `char` to the list `digits`. Since `char` is the next character in `password`, which is a string of length n-1 (1 ≤ n-1 ≤ 19) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` itself is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The list `digits` is updated to include this new character.

Output State: **`password` is a string of length n-1 (1 ≤ n-1 ≤ 19) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password`, `digits` is a list containing the characters appended from `password` including the current `char`.**
