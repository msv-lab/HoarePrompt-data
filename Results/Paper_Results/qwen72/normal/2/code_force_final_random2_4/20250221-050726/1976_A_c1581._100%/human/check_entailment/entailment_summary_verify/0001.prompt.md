You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a string `password` as input, which is expected to be between 1 and 20 characters long, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the digits and letters from the password into two lists, sorts these lists, and then checks if the sorted combination of these lists matches the original password. The function returns `True` if the sorted combination of digits and letters is identical to the original password, indicating that the password is already in a non-decreasing order of digits followed by letters. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists to ensure that the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the sorted digits are in non-decreasing order by iterating through the `digits` list and comparing adjacent elements.
   - It also checks if any digit appears after a letter by comparing the last digit with the first letter in the `letters` list.
   - It combines the sorted digits and letters back into a single string and compares it with the original password to ensure the password meets all the conditions.

3. **Conditions Verification:**
   - **Digits Sorted:** The program ensures that all digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - **Letters Sorted:** The program ensures that all letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - **No Digit After Letter:** The program ensures that no digit appears after a letter by checking the relative positions of the last digit and the first letter.
   - **Password Structure:** The program ensures that the password, when sorted, matches the original password, which confirms that the password meets all the conditions.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as passwords with only digits or only letters correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
