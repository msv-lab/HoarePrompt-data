The code appends the value of `char` to the list `letters`. Since `char` is the next character in `password`, which is a string of length n-1 (1 ≤ n-1 ≤ 19) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, the list `letters` now includes this new character. The length of `password` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string of length n-1 (1 ≤ n-1 ≤ 19) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password`, `letters` now contains the characters from `password` plus the character `char`.**
