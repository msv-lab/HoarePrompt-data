Postcondition: ***`password` is a string of length n-1 (1 ≤ n-1 ≤ 19) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the characters appended from `password` including the current `char`. Otherwise, `letters` now contains the characters from `password` plus the character `char`.***
