Postcondition: ***`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a non-empty list, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appeared before sorting, `i` is 0, and either `i` is equal to or greater than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`. Additionally, either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`.***
