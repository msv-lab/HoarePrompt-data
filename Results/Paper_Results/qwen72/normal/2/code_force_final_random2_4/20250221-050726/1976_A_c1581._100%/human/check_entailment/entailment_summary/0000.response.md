Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to validate whether a given password meets specific criteria for being considered strong. The criteria include:
- The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
- All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
- All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself. It then calls the `func_1` function to check if the password meets the criteria.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The function correctly separates the digits and letters from the password into two separate lists.
2. **Sorting**: Both the digits and letters lists are sorted individually.
3. **Validation**:
   - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures no digit comes after a letter by comparing the last digit with the first letter (if any).
   - Finally, it combines the sorted digits and letters and checks if this combined string matches the original password.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Digit After Letter Check**: The logic to ensure no digit comes after a letter is flawed. The current implementation checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not sufficient. It should ensure that no digit appears after any letter in the original password.
2. **Combination Check**: The final check to see if the sorted combination matches the original password is correct but redundant because the earlier checks should already ensure the password meets the criteria.

### Corrected Logic:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that no digit appears after any letter in the original password. This can be done by checking the relative positions of digits and letters as they appear in the password.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    has_letter = False
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if has_letter:
                return False  # Digit found after a letter
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            has_letter = True
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

### Final Answer:
Given the issues identified and the corrected logic, the original program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
