You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, an integer t (t=1) indicating the number of rounds, n-1 pairs of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) describing the edges of the tree, and a single integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.

    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are the last input integers processed, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque containing the elements in a specific order based on the input pairs `(u, v)` such that each `u` or `v` is added to the appropriate end of `tree` according to the rules defined in the loop.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :

If at least one element in `moves` is odd, the condition is met. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the tree is not a simple linear structure but has branches. The current implementation assumes a linear structure, which may not always be the case for a tree with exactly two leaves. For example, consider a tree where the structure is more complex, such as:

```
  1
   \
    2
   / \
  3   4
   \
    5
```

In this tree, the leaves are 5 and 4, but the program will incorrectly assume a linear structure and may produce wrong results. Specifically, the logic for appending nodes to the `tree` deque does not account for branching structures, leading to incorrect indexing and movement calculations. Therefore, the program is incorrect for trees that are not linear.
