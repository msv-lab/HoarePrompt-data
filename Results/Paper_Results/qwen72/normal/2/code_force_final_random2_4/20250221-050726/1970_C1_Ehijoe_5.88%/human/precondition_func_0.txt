The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, an integer t (t=1) indicating the number of rounds, n-1 pairs of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) describing the edges of the tree, and a single integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
