Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` has `v` as its first element, and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. If `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, then `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u, v]`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.***
