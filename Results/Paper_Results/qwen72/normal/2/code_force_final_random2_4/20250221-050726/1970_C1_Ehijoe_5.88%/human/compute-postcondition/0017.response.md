Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with `v` as its first element, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree` (which is now `v`), and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree` (which remains unchanged). The current value of `u` is equal to the first element of `tree` (which is now `v`).**
