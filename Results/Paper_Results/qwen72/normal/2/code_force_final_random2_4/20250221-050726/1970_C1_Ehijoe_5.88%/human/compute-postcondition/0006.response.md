Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing `[u]`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `tree.append(u)` adds the value of `u` to the deque `tree`.
- Initially, `tree` was an empty deque, so after appending `u`, `tree` now contains `[u]`.
- Since `tree` is no longer empty, the variable `empty` is updated to `False`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
