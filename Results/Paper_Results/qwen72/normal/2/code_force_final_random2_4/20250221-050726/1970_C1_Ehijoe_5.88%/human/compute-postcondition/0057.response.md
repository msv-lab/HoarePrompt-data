Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are the last input integers processed, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing the elements in a specific order based on the input pairs `(u, v)`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is `[min(1, idx), min(1, n - idx - 1)]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet creates a list `moves` with two elements. The first element is the minimum of `t` (which is 1) and `idx` (the index of `start` in `tree`). The second element is the minimum of `t` (which is 1) and `n - idx - 1` (the distance from `idx` to the end of the range defined by `n`). All other variables remain unchanged.
