Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing `u` and `v` appended to its right side.**

Explanation: The code snippet `empty = False` does not change the value of `empty` because it was already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, all other variables and their values remain unchanged. The `tree` deque still contains `u` and `v` appended to its right side.
