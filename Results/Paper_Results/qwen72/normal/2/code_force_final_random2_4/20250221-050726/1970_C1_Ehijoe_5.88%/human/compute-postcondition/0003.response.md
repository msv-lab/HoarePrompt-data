To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(n - 1)` generates a sequence of numbers. This happens if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 200000.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `tree` is an empty deque.
   - `empty` is True.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `n` is already given to be between 2 and 200000, it satisfies the condition `n > 1`.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 when the loop begins.
   - The other variables (`t`, `tree`, and `empty`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

### Final State:
Given that `n` is already within the required range, no further adjustments are needed for `n`. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True, `i` is 0**
