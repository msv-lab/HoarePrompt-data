The code snippet `empty = False` sets the variable `empty` to `False`. Since `empty` was already `False` in the initial state, there is no change in its value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing `u` and `v`.**
