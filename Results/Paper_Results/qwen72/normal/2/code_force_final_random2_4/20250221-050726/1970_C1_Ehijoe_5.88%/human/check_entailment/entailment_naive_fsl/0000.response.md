Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the tree is not a simple linear structure but has branches. The current implementation assumes a linear structure, which may not always be the case for a tree with exactly two leaves. For example, consider a tree where the structure is more complex, such as:

```
  1
   \
    2
   / \
  3   4
   \
    5
```

In this tree, the leaves are 5 and 4, but the program will incorrectly assume a linear structure and may produce wrong results. Specifically, the logic for appending nodes to the `tree` deque does not account for branching structures, leading to incorrect indexing and movement calculations. Therefore, the program is incorrect for trees that are not linear.
