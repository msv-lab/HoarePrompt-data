Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` is a list of strings from the input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `arr` is an empty list if `n` is not equal to 1.
- `k0` is equal to `k` if `n` is not equal to 1.
- `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k` if `n` is not equal to 1.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is defined as the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`.
- The `print(k)` statement will simply print the value of `k`.

### Output:
Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the list l1)**

This means that the value of `k` will be printed, and `k` is derived from the second element of the list `l1` converted to an integer.
