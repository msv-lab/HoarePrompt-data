Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
