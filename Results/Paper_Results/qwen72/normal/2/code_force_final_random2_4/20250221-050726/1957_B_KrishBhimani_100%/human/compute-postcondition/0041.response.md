Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list containing specific values based on certain conditions.
- The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns `ans` to an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `_`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
