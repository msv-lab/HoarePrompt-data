For the given `while True:` loop, since the condition is always `True`, the loop will continue to execute unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Given the information about the state at the end of the previous iteration, no adjustments are necessary to the state for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition (`True`) does not depend on any specific state variables.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is set to 1 and `temp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `i` remains 0, `temp` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
