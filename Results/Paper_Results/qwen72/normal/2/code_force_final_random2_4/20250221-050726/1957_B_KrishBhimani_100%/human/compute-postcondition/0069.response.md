Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, if `n` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`. Additionally, `temp` is \(2^i\) when `n` is not 1.

Code:
```
l1 = input().split()
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `l1` is reassigned to the result of `input().split()`, which splits the input string by whitespace and returns a list of strings.
2. The previous value of `l1` is overwritten, so the new value of `l1` is the list of strings from the new input.
3. The values of `n` and `k` are derived from the new `l1`, so they will be updated based on the new input.
4. The values of `t`, `_`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified by subsequent code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, if `n` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`. Additionally, `temp` is \(2^i\) when `n` is not 1.**
