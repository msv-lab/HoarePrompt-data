Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list. The loop will continue to execute as long as `temp * 2` is less than `k`. After the loop finishes, `i` will be the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`, and `temp` will be `2^i`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed its execution, the variable `i` will hold the largest integer such that `2^i` is still less than `k`, and `temp` will hold the value `2^i`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`) will retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.
