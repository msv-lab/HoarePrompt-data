For the given task, the `while` loop condition is `True`, which means the loop is set to run indefinitely (or until a break statement is encountered within the loop). Since the loop condition is always true, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `temp` is 1**
