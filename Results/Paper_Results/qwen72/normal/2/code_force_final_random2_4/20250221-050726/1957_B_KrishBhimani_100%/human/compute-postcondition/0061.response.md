Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`, `temp` is \(2^i\).**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to double the value of `temp` and increment `i` as long as `temp * 2` is less than `k`.
- When `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`, the loop breaks.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`, and `i` will be the exponent of that power of 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `_`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
