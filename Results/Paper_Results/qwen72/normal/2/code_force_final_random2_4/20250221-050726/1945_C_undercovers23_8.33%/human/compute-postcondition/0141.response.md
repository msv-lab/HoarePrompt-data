Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`.
- `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.
- If the length of `final` is 0, `final` is updated to contain exactly one element:
  - `0` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50.
  - `n` otherwise.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(final[0])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `mini`**:
   - `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`.

2. **Construct `final`**:
   - `final` is a list of elements from `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`.
   - This list is then sorted.

3. **Check the length of `final`**:
   - If `final` is empty (`len(final) == 0`), it is updated based on the value of `c1`:
     - `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
     - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is set to `[0]`.
     - Otherwise, `final` is set to `[n]`.

4. **Print the first element of `final`**:
   - The code snippet `print(final[0])` will print the first element of the `final` list.

### Possible Outcomes:
- If `final` is not empty after the initial construction, `final[0]` will be the smallest element from `lst` that has the minimum absolute difference with `pk`.
- If `final` is empty, it will be updated to either `[0]` or `[n]` based on the value of `c1`.

### Final Output:
- If `final` is not empty, the output will be the first element of `final`.
- If `final` is empty and `c1 >= 50`, the output will be `0`.
- If `final` is empty and `c1 < 50`, the output will be `n`.

Given the conditions, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is the first element of the sorted list `final` containing elements from `lst` with the minimum absolute difference to `pk`, or 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` otherwise)**
