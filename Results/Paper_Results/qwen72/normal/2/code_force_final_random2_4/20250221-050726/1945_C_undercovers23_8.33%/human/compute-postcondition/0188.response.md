Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and any element in the list `lst`.
- All other variables (`final`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `lst`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
