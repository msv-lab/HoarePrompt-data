Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. The list `lst` must contain at least as many elements as the number of iterations executed. Each `ele` in `lst` has been used to update `mini` to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The final value of `mini` is the smallest of these differences. `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, `lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` is a list containing `[elem]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, `lst` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing `[first element in lst, elem]` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is also equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` is a list containing `[elem]`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is not equal to `mini`, `final` remains unchanged (i.e., it is either an empty list or a list containing `[first element in lst]` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is equal to `mini`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, `lst` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing `[elem]` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is not equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` is a list containing `[first element in lst, elem]`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is not equal to `mini`, `final` remains unchanged (i.e., it is either an empty list or a list containing `[first element in lst]` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is equal to `mini`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
