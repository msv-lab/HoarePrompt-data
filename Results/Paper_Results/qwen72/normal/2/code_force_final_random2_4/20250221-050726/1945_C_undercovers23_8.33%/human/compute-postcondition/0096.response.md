To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `s` is an input string
- `pk` is `n // 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from `s`
- `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`
- `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`
- `mini` is `100000000`
- `i` is 0
- `zero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' and 0 otherwise
- `one` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' and 1 otherwise
- `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`
- `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`
- `lst` is [1] if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list
- `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`
- If `len(final) == 0`, then `c1` is `o * 100 // n`
- If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0
- Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes `n`
- `z` is updated to the count of '0' in `sl`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- `n` remains the same as it is an input integer and does not change.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 1, `zero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is [1] if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, if `len(final) == 0`, then `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0, otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes `n`, `z` is updated to the count of '0' in `sl`**
