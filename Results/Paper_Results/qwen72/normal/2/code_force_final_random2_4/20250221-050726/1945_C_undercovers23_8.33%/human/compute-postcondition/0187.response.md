Output State: **`mini` is updated to `min(min(100000000, abs(n // 2 - ele)), abs(pk - ele), abs(pk - ele))`, `lst` must have at least two more elements, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
- The initial value of `mini` was `min(min(100000000, abs(n // 2 - ele)), abs(pk - ele))`.
- After the update, `mini` becomes `min(min(100000000, abs(n // 2 - ele)), abs(pk - ele), abs(pk - ele))`.
- The condition that `lst` must have at least two more elements remains unchanged.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
