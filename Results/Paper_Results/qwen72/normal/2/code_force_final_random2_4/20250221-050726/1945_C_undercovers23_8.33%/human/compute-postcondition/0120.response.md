Output State: **After all iterations, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. The list `lst` must contain at least as many elements as the number of iterations executed. Each `ele` in `lst` has been used to update `mini` to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The final value of `mini` is the smallest of these differences. `final` is an empty list.**
