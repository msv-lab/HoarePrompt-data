Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The length of `final` is 0. `c1` is equal to `(o * 100) // n`, and the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**
