Output State: **`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, `lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing `[elem]`, and the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.** 

The code appends the first element of `lst` (which is `elem`) to the list `final`, which was initially empty. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
