Output State: **`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The length of `final` is 0. `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `c1 = o * 100 // n` assigns the value of `o * 100 // n` to the variable `c1`. The variables `mini`, `final`, and the length of `final` remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `c1` and retains the initial conditions for `mini` and `final`.
