Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 or 0, `one` is 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `zero_perc` using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- Since `i` is 0, the denominator `(i + 1)` is 1.
- If `zero` is 1, then `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 1)`, which is 100.
- If `zero` is 0, then `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(0 * 100 / 1)`, which is 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
