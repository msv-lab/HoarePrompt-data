Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `final` is an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` of `lst` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` contains the first element of `lst`. `lst` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` is an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` of `lst` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` contains the first element of `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element `elem` of `lst` is also equal to `mini`, then `final` contains both the first and the second elements of `lst`. `lst` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` contains the first, second, and third elements of `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and each of these elements is equal to `mini`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element `elem` of `lst` is not equal to `mini`, `final` contains the first and second elements of `lst` if their absolute differences with `pk` are equal to `mini`. `lst` has at least 3 elements, and `elem` is the third element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
