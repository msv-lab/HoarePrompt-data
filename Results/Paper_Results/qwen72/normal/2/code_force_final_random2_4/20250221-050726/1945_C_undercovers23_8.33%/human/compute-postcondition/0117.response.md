The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` must contain at least two elements, and `ele` is the next element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must contain at least three elements, and `ele` will be the next (third) element in the list.

State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in the list; `lst` must contain at least three elements; `ele` is the third element in the list**
