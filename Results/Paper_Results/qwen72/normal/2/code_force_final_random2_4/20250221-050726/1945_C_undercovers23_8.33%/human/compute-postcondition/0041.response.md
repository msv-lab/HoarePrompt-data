Postcondition: ***`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero` is 3 or 2, `one` is 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3]`. Otherwise, `lst` is a list containing `[1, 2]`.***
