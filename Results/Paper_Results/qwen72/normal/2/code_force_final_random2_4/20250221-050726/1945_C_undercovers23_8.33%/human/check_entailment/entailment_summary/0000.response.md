Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the optimal position to place a road in a village, ensuring that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side. The solution involves iterating through the string representation of residents' preferences and calculating the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's to determine the best split point.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Setup**: It initializes variables to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's, and sets up a list to store potential valid positions.
3. **Iterating Through the String**: The program iterates through the string, updating the counts of '0's and '1's for the left and right sides of the road.
4. **Condition Check**: For each position, it checks if the current split satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
5. **Finding the Optimal Position**: It keeps track of the positions that meet the condition and selects the one closest to the middle of the village.
6. **Edge Case Handling**: If no valid positions are found, it checks the overall satisfaction and outputs the appropriate edge case (0 or n).

However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

1. **Percentage Calculation**: The program calculates percentages using `math.ceil` and multiplies by 100, which is unnecessary. Instead, it should directly check if the counts meet the required condition.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The logic for handling the edge cases (when no valid positions are found) is overly complex and can be simplified.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize counts
        zero_count = 0
        one_count = s.count('1')
        
        # Initialize variables to track the best position
        best_position = -1
        min_distance = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero_count += 1
            else:
                one_count -= 1
            
            # Calculate the number of '0's and '1's on both sides
            left_zeros = zero_count
            left_ones = i + 1 - zero_count
            right_zeros = s.count('0') - zero_count
            right_ones = one_count
            
            # Check if the current position satisfies the condition
            if left_zeros >= (i + 1) // 2 + (i + 1) % 2 and right_ones >= (n - i - 1) // 2 + (n - i - 1) % 2:
                distance = abs(n // 2 - i)
                if distance < min_distance:
                    min_distance = distance
                    best_position = i
        
        # Handle edge cases
        if best_position == -1:
            if s.count('1') >= n // 2 + n % 2:
                best_position = 0
            else:
                best_position = n
        
        print(best_position)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Simplified Condition Check**: The condition check now directly compares the counts of '0's and '1's without converting to percentages.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Simplified the logic for handling cases where no valid positions are found.
3. **Optimized Distance Calculation**: Directly calculates the distance from the middle and updates the best position accordingly.

Given these changes, the program should now correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
