The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`.

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
- `t` is an integer equal to 1.
- `nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing adjacent nodes.
- `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. However, based on the parameters, it is likely that the function performs some operation related to graph traversal or manipulation, starting from the node specified by `start`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`. It processes a graph represented by `nodes` starting from the node `start`, with `n` specifying the number of nodes and `t` being an integer equal to 1. The function returns a result based on the graph traversal or manipulation.**
