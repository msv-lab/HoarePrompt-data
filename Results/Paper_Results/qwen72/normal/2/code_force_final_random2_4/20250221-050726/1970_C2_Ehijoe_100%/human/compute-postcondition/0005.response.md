Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing adjacent nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ start â‰¤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user.**

The values of `u` and `v` are now integers that have been read from the user input. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
