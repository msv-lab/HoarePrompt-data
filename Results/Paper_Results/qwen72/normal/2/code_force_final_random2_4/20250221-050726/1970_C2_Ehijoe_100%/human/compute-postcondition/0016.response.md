Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key (representing a node) has a list of integers (representing adjacent nodes) based on the inputs provided during the loop, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is `n-1`, and `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n-1` times, so `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
- Each iteration of the loop reads a pair of integers `u` and `v` from the user and updates the `nodes` dictionary to include these pairs as adjacent nodes.
- The `nodes` dictionary will contain all the adjacency information provided through the loop.
- The variables `t`, `start`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
