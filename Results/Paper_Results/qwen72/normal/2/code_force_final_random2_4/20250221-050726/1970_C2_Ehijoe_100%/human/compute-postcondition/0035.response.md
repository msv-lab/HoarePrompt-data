Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict with all keys processed, `start` is an integer input by the user, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers provided by the user, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from the `nodes` dictionary whose corresponding lists have a length of 1, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. If `moves` is not empty, `moves` contains at least one element. If `moves` is empty, `moves` is False.***
