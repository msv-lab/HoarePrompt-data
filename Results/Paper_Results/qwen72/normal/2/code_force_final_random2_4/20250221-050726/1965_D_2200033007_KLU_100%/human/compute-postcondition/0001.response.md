The last element of `bigList` is removed by the `pop()` method. Since `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` before the operation, after removing the last element from `bigList`, the condition `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` no longer holds true because `bigList` now has one less element. However, the length of `bigList` is still greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists still contain at least one element.

Output State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element, but `bigList[-1]` is no longer equal to `smallList[-1]`.**
