Output State: **`odds` must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `idx - 1`, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`, `a[idx]` is now `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.
- The values of `odds`, `x`, `idx`, and `prev` remain as described in the initial state, with `prev` being updated to the current value of `x`.
- The condition `if idx == n - 1 - idx` is not considered in this code snippet, so the alternative assignment to `a[n - 1 - idx]` does not occur.
