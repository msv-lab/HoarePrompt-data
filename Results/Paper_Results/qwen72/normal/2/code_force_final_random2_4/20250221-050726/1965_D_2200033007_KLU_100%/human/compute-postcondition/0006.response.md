To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

1. **Condition 1: `len(smallList) > 0`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the length of `smallList` was reduced by 1. For the loop to execute again, `smallList` must still have at least one element. Therefore, the length of `smallList` must be greater than 0.

2. **Condition 2: `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must be true. However, since we cannot change the elements of `bigList` or `smallList` directly (as per the task constraints), we need to ensure that the last elements of both lists are equal.

Given these conditions, the only way to satisfy both conditions is to ensure that `smallList` still has at least one element and that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. Since we cannot change the elements directly, we assume that the last elements were equal before the last iteration, and the reduction in `smallList`'s length did not affect this equality.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `smallList` must still have at least one element.
- The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Since the length of `smallList` is already reduced by 1, we need to ensure that it still has at least one element. The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the new last element of `smallList`.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element, and the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`. The length of `smallList` is reduced by 1.**
