The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing the sums of odd-indexed subarrays of a palindromic array, and `n`, an integer indicating the length of the palindromic array to be reconstructed. It returns a list `a` of length `n`, which represents the reconstructed palindromic array based on the sums provided in `odds`. After the function executes, the list `a` contains the elements of the original palindromic array, and the input parameters `odds` and `n` remain unchanged.
