Output State: **`odds` must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `idx - 2`, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`. If `idx == n - 1 - (idx + 1)`, `a[idx]` is now equal to the current value of `x`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - (idx + 1)]` is now `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is decremented by 1, making it `idx - 2`.
- The conditions and values of `odds`, `x`, and `prev` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The condition `if idx == n - 1 - idx` is updated to reflect the new value of `idx`, which is `idx - 2`.
- The assignment to `a[n - 1 - idx]` is also updated to reflect the new value of `idx`, which is `idx - 2`.
