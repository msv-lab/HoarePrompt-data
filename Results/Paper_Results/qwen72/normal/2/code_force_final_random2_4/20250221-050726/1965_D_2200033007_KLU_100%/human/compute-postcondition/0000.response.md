To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

1. **Condition 1: `len(smallList) > 0`**
   - This condition is already satisfied because the state specifies that both lists contain at least one element.

2. **Condition 2: `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**
   - This condition requires that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` be equal. The current state does not specify whether these elements are equal, so we need to adjust this state to ensure they are equal.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state to guarantee that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element, and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**
