Output State: **`odds` must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `idx - 1`, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, `a[idx]` is now equal to the current value of `x`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is now `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prev` is updated to the current value of `x`.
- The values of `odds`, `idx`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition `if idx == n - 1 - idx` and the subsequent assignment to `a[idx]` or `a[n - 1 - idx]` are not affected by the code snippet provided.
- The initial state conditions about `odds`, `x`, `idx`, and the potential assignments to `a` remain valid.
