Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing only uppercase letters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `i` (0 <= i < 7) represents the number of occurrences of the character `chr(i + ord('A'))` in the string `a`, `i` is 1. If `count[1]` is less than `m`, then `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[1]`. If `count[0]` is also less than `m`, then `needed_problems` is further adjusted to `(m - count[0]) + (m - count[1])`. Otherwise, `needed_problems` remains 0.***
