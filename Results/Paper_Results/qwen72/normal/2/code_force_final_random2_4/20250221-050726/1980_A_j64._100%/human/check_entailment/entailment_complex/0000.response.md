Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and the string `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: Inside the function `func_1`, it initializes a list `count` of size 7 to store the number of occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` for each character.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then iterates over the `count` list to determine how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems of each type. If the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`, the difference is added to `needed_problems`.

4. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns the total number of additional problems needed.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems required for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
