Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 to zero. It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` based on the character's position in the alphabet. This correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. If the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`. This ensures that each difficulty level appears at least `m` times.

4. **Output**: The function returns the total number of additional problems needed, which is the sum of all the differences calculated in the previous step.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `m` is 1 and there are no problems of a certain difficulty level, it will correctly return 1 for that difficulty level.

6. **Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, ensuring that `n` and `m` are within the specified ranges and that the string `a` contains only uppercase letters from 'A' to 'G'.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
