    #The program returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. This value is calculated based on the current counts of each character stored in the list `count` and the required minimum occurrences `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer), `m` (an integer), and `a` (a string). It calculates and returns the total number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. The function does not modify the input parameters and only returns the computed integer value.
