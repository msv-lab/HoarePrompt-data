You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))

def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer), `m` (an integer), and `a` (a string). It calculates and returns the total number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. The function does not modify the input parameters and only returns the computed integer value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.
3. **Counting Problem Difficulties**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 to keep track of the number of problems for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the character's position in the alphabet.
4. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. If the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
