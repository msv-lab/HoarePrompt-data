t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board, and x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, with 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not coincide, i.e., either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.
