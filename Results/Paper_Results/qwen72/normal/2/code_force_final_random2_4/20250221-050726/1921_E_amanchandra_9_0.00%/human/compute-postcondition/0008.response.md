Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.
- `w` is an input integer.
- `yb` is an input integer.
- `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, and the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, so `x` is a specific integer value.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
