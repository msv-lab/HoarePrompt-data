Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `h` is an input integer.
   - `w` is an input integer.
   - `xa` is an input integer.
   - `ya` is an input integer.
   - `xb` is an input integer.
   - `yb` is an input integer.
   - `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`.
   - `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`.
   - The absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd.
   - `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`.
   - `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`.

2. **Conditions in the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement uses a conditional expression to decide between two lists: `['Draw']` and `['Alice']`.
   - The condition is `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`.

3. **Analyzing the Condition:**
   - `x` is half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, rounded down.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
   - The condition checks if both `abs(l - ya)` and `abs(r - ya)` are less than or equal to `x + 1`.

4. **Evaluating the Condition:**
   - Since `x` is half the odd difference between `xa` and `xb`, `x` is an integer.
   - `l` and `r` are calculated based on `yb` and `x`, ensuring they stay within the bounds of 1 and `w`.
   - The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` checks if `ya` is within a certain range around `l` and `r`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - If the condition is true, the print statement will output `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is false, the print statement will output `['Draw']`.

Given the complexity and the specific conditions, the output depends on the values of `ya`, `yb`, `x`, `l`, and `r`. However, without specific values for these variables, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition.

Output: **['Alice'] if `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is true, otherwise ['Draw']**.
