Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is calculated as `max(1, ya - x)`.
- `x` is already defined as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, which is a non-negative integer because the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even.
- `ya` is an input integer, and `x` is a non-negative integer, so `ya - x` could be a positive integer, zero, or negative.
- `max(1, ya - x)` ensures that `l` is at least 1, even if `ya - x` is less than 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
