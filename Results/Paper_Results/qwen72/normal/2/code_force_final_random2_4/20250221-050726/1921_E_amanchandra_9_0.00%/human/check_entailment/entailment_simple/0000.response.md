### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the board dimensions (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`).

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The function checks if `xa > xb`. If this condition is true, it means Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, and since Alice starts the game, she cannot move her chip up. Therefore, the game will end in a draw because neither player can win under these conditions.

3. **Distance Calculation**: If `xa <= xb`, the function calculates the distance between Alice's and Bob's chips using `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This distance is used to determine the possible positions where Alice and Bob can move their chips.

4. **Odd Distance Case**: If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, the function calculates the range of possible y-coordinates (`l` and `r`) for Alice's chip. It then checks if Alice's chip can move into a position where it can capture Bob's chip. If so, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

5. **Even Distance Case**: If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is even, the function calculates the range of possible y-coordinates (`l` and `r`) for Bob's chip. It then checks if Bob's chip can move into a position where it can capture Alice's chip. If so, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

6. **Boundary Conditions**: The function correctly handles boundary conditions by using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)` to ensure that the calculated y-coordinates do not go out of bounds.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly handle all the given conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
