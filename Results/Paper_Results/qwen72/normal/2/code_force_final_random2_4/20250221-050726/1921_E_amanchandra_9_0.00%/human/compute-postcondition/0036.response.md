Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `h` is the new input integer, `w` is the new input integer, `xa` is the new input integer, `ya` is the new input integer, `xb` is the new input integer, `yb` is the new input integer, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**

Explanation:
- `r` is assigned the value of `min(w, yb + x)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
