The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input from `range(int(input()))`. The loop's execution depends on `i` being less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer. If `xa > xb`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, then `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. If `abs(xa - xb)` is even, then `l` is set to `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`.**
