To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions in the `print` statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `i` is 1.
- `h` is an input integer.
- `w` is an input integer.
- `xa` is an input integer.
- `ya` is an input integer.
- `xb` is an input integer.
- `yb` is an input integer.
- `x` is calculated as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, ya - x)`.
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = (abs(xa - xb) // 2)`: This is the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2.

2. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, ya - x)`: This ensures that `l` is at least 1, but it could be larger if `ya - x` is greater than 1.

3. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, yb + x)`: This ensures that `r` does not exceed `w`, but it could be smaller if `yb + x` is less than `w`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - The condition in the `print` statement is `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`.
   - This checks if both `l` and `r` are within `x` units of `yb`.

5. **Determine the Output:**
   - If the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is true, the `print` statement will output `Bob`.
   - If the condition is false, the `print` statement will output `Draw`.

### Final Output:
The output depends on the values of `l`, `r`, and `yb` relative to `x`. Since the exact values of `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `h`, and `w` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **Bob (if `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x` are both true) or Draw (otherwise)**

This means the output will be either "Bob" or "Draw" based on the condition described.
