Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer. If `xa` > `xb`, no changes are made to the variables. If `xa` ≤ `xb`, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is set to `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`.***
