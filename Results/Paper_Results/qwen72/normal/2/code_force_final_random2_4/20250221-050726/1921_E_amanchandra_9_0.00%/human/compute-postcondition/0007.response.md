Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is calculated as `max(1, yb - x)`.
- `x` is already defined as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`.
- Since the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `x` will be an integer.
- `l` will be the maximum of 1 and the result of `yb - x`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
