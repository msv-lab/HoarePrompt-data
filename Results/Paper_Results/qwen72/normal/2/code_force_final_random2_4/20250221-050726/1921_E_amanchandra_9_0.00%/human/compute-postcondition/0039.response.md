Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `h` is the new input integer, `w` is the new input integer, `xa` is the new input integer, `ya` is the new input integer, `xb` is the new input integer, `yb` is the new input integer. If `xa > xb`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. If `abs(xa - xb)` is even, `l` is set to `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`.***
