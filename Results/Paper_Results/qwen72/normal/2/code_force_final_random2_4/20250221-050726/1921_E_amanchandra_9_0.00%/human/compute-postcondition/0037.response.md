To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the `print` statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `i` is 2.
- `h` is a new input integer.
- `w` is a new input integer.
- `xa` is a new input integer.
- `ya` is a new input integer.
- `xb` is a new input integer.
- `yb` is a new input integer.
- `x` is calculated as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, ya - x)`.
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = (abs(xa - xb) // 2)`: This calculates half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`.

2. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, ya - x)`: This ensures that `l` is at least 1 and at most `ya - x`.

3. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, yb + x)`: This ensures that `r` is at most `w` and at least `yb + x`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` checks if both `l` and `r` are within `x` units of `yb`.

5. **Print Statement Logic:**
   - If the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is true, the `print` statement will print `'Bob'`.
   - If the condition is false, the `print` statement will print `'Draw'`.

### Final Output:
The output depends on the values of `l`, `r`, and `yb` relative to `x`. Since the exact values of `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `h`, and `w` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **'Bob' if `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is true, otherwise 'Draw' (where `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`, and `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`)**
