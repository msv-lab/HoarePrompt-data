To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is automatically managed by the `for` loop and starts at 0 by default.
2. **Result of `int(input())`:** This represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases.
- The input for the loop is expected to be the number of test cases, which should be equal to `t`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
