The provided code snippet reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. This operation updates the values of these variables, replacing their initial states with the new input values.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `i` is 1
- `h` is an input integer
- `w` is an input integer
- `xa` is an input integer
- `ya` is an input integer
- `xb` is an input integer
- `yb` is an input integer

After executing the code:
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are updated to the new input values.
- The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer.**
