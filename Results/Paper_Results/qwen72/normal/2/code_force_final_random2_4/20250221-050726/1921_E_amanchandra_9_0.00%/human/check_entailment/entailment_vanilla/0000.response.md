### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The function checks if `xa > xb`. If this condition is true, it prints "Draw". This is because if Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, Alice cannot move up, and Bob cannot move down, so the game will end in a draw. This logic is correct.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The function calculates the distance `x` between Alice's and Bob's chips using `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This is the number of moves required for Alice to potentially reach Bob's initial position.

4. **Odd Distance Case**: If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, the function calculates the range of possible y-coordinates `l` and `r` where Alice can move to. It then checks if Alice can move to a position within this range such that she can win. If `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw". This logic is correct because if Alice can move to a position where she can capture Bob's chip, she wins.

5. **Even Distance Case**: If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is even, the function calculates the range of possible y-coordinates `l` and `r` where Bob can move to. It then checks if Bob can move to a position within this range such that he can win. If `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw". This logic is correct because if Bob can move to a position where he can capture Alice's chip, he wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given problem by considering the initial positions of the chips, the possible moves, and the conditions under which each player can win or the game ends in a draw. The logic and implementation are sound.

Correctness: **True**
