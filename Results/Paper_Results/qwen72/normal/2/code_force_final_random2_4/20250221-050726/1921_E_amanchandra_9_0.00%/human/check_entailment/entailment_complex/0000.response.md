### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.

2. **Initial Position Check:**
   - If `x_a > x_b`, the function immediately prints "Draw". This is because Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, and neither can move into the other's position without going out of bounds.

3. **Calculating Possible Moves:**
   - If `x_a <= x_b`, the function calculates `x` as half the absolute difference between `x_a` and `x_b` (integer division).
   - Depending on whether `abs(x_a - x_b)` is odd or even, different conditions are checked to determine the outcome.

4. **Odd Difference Case:**
   - If `abs(x_a - x_b)` is odd:
     - Calculate `l` as the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
     - Calculate `r` as the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
     - Check if Alice can win by moving to a position within the range `[l, r]` with a distance of `x + 1` from `ya`.
     - If the condition is met, print "Alice"; otherwise, print "Draw".

5. **Even Difference Case:**
   - If `abs(x_a - x_b)` is even:
     - Calculate `l` as the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`.
     - Calculate `r` as the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
     - Check if Bob can win by moving to a position within the range `[l, r]` with a distance of `x` from `yb`.
     - If the condition is met, print "Bob"; otherwise, print "Draw".

### Analysis:
- The logic for determining the outcome based on the initial positions and the possible moves is sound.
- The conditions for checking if Alice or Bob can win are correctly implemented.
- The function handles all edge cases, such as when Alice's chip is initially below Bob's chip, and when the difference in their positions is odd or even.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
