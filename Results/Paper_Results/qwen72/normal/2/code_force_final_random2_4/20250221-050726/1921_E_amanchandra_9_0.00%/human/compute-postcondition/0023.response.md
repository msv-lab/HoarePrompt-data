Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`**

Explanation: The value of `l` is calculated as the maximum between 1 and the difference `ya - x`. The value of `x` is already defined as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
