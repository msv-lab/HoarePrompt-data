To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to compute `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is an input string.
- `p` is the string 'ABCDEF'.
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object containing the frequency of each character in `s`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not a key in `hmp`:**
   - For each character in the string 'ABCDEF', check if it is not a key in `hmp`.
   - If a character is not a key in `hmp`, add `m` to the sum.

2. **Sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each key `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`:**
   - For each key `i` in `hmp` (which represents a character in `s`), check if the frequency `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.
   - If `hmp[i] < m`, add `(m - hmp[i])` to the sum.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for the inputs:
- `n = 6` (length of the string `s`)
- `m = 2` (some integer)
- `s = "ABCD"`

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Create `hmp` from `s`:**
   - `hmp = Counter({'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1})`

2. **Sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not a key in `hmp`:**
   - Characters in 'ABCDEF' that are not keys in `hmp`: 'E', 'F'
   - Sum: `m + m = 2 + 2 = 4`

3. **Sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each key `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`:**
   - For 'A': `hmp['A'] = 1` (since 1 < 2, add `2 - 1 = 1`)
   - For 'B': `hmp['B'] = 1` (since 1 < 2, add `2 - 1 = 1`)
   - For 'C': `hmp['C'] = 1` (since 1 < 2, add `2 - 1 = 1`)
   - For 'D': `hmp['D'] = 1` (since 1 < 2, add `2 - 1 = 1`)
   - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`

4. **Total `ans`:**
   - `ans = 4 (from non-key characters) + 4 (from key characters) = 8`

### Final Output:
Based on the given initial state and the calculation, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans` which is the sum of the two parts described above.

Output: **8 (where 8 is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not a key in `hmp` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each key `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`)**
