Let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This means `t` is decremented by 1, but it doesn't affect the `print` statement directly.
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is an input string.
- `p` is the string 'ABCDEF'.
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.
- `ans` is calculated as follows:
  - For each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp`, add `m` to `ans`.
  - For each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, add `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Characters in 'ABCDEF' not in `hmp`**:
   - If a character from 'ABCDEF' is not in `hmp`, it means that character does not appear in the string `s`.
   - For each such character, add `m` to `ans`.

2. **Characters in `hmp` with frequency less than `m`**:
   - For each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, add `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `n = 10` (this value is not used in the calculation of `ans`).
- `m = 3`.
- `s = "ABCD"`.

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Create `hmp`**:
   - `hmp` will be: `{'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1}`.

2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - Characters in 'ABCDEF' not in `hmp`: 'E' and 'F'.
     - Add `m` for 'E': `ans += 3`.
     - Add `m` for 'F': `ans += 3`.
   - Characters in `hmp` with frequency less than `m`:
     - 'A': `hmp['A'] = 1` (less than `m`), so add `m - hmp['A'] = 3 - 1 = 2` to `ans`.
     - 'B': `hmp['B'] = 1` (less than `m`), so add `m - hmp['B'] = 3 - 1 = 2` to `ans`.
     - 'C': `hmp['C'] = 1` (less than `m`), so add `m - hmp['C'] = 3 - 1 = 2` to `ans`.
     - 'D': `hmp['D'] = 1` (less than `m`), so add `m - hmp['D'] = 3 - 1 = 2` to `ans`.

   - Summing up:
     - `ans = 3 (for 'E') + 3 (for 'F') + 2 (for 'A') + 2 (for 'B') + 2 (for 'C') + 2 (for 'D') = 14`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans` based on the input string `s` and the integer `m`.

Output: **14 (where 14 is the calculated value of `ans` based on the input string `s` and the integer `m`)**.
