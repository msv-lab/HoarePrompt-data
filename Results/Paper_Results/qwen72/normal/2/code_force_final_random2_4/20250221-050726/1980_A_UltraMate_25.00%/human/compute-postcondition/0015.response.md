The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. Given the initial state, `ans` was previously set based on whether 'B' is a key in `hmp`. If 'B' is not a key in `hmp`, `ans` was initially set to `m`. If 'B' is a key in `hmp`, `ans` was initially set to 0. After executing the code snippet, `ans` will be incremented by `m` regardless of its initial value.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is 'B', and `ans` is `m` if 'B' is not a key in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` is `2 * m`.**
