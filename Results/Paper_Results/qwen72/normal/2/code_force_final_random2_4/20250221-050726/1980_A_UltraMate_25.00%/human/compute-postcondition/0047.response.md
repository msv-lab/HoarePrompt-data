Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`, which is 'ABCDEF'.
- For each character `i` in `p`, the loop checks if `i` is not in `hmp` (the Counter object).
- If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m`.
- After all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that does not appear in the input string `s`.
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, as specified in the initial state.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp`) remain unchanged.
