Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format specified in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Character Counting**: The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. This is a correct approach to keep track of the available problems of each difficulty level.

3. **Calculation of Additional Problems**:
   - The program iterates over the characters 'A' to 'F' (missing 'G') and checks if each character is present in the counter `hmp`. If a character is missing, it adds `m` to the answer `ans` because `m` problems of that difficulty are needed.
   - For characters that are present but have fewer than `m` occurrences, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

However, there is a minor issue:
- The string `p` is defined as `'ABCDEF'`, which means the program does not account for the 'G' difficulty level. According to the problem statement, each round should include problems of difficulties 'A' to 'G'. Therefore, the program should also check for the 'G' character.

Given this oversight, the program is incorrect as it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
