Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

# Annotated Program:
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are the last input integers, `s` is the last input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the last input string `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp` plus the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of inputs and calculates the number of additional occurrences required for each character in 'ABCDEF' to appear at least `m` times in the input string `s`. It prints this number for each set of inputs. The function processes `t` test cases, where for each case, it takes two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it prints the calculated number for each test case.
