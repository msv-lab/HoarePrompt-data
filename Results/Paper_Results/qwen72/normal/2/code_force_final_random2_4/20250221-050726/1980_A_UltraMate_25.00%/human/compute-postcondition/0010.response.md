Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`. If `i` (which is 'A') is not a key in the `hmp` Counter object, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
