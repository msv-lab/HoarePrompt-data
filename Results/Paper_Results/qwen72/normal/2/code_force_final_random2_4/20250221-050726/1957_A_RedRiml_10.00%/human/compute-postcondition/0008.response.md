The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Given that `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, and the key `i` does not exist in the dictionary `d` initially, this operation adds a new key-value pair to `d`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the first element in `palka`) and value 1, `i` is the first element in `palka`.**
