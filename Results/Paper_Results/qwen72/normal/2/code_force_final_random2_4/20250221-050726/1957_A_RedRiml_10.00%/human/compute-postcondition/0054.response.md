Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `pl` is a list. If `i` is not in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 (or set to 1 if `d.get(i)` is None). `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. If `i` is already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged, and `d` is not modified.***
