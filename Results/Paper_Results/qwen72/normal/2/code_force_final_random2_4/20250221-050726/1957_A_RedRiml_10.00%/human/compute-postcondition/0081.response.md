To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`: Integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
   - `w`: Greater than 1.
   - `_`: Equal to 1.
   - `ln`: An input integer.
   - `palka`: A list of integers read from input.
   - `pl`: A list containing all unique elements from `palka`.
   - `d`: A dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
   - `shapes`: The number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

2. **Steps to Determine `shapes`:**
   - **Read Input:**
     - `ln` is an input integer, which is the length of the list `palka`.
     - `palka` is a list of integers read from input.
   - **Create Unique List:**
     - `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`.
   - **Count Occurrences:**
     - `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
   - **Determine `shapes`:**
     - `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `palka = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.
   - `pl` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (unique elements).
   - `d` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}` (count of each element).
   - `shapes` would be the number of elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
   - In this case, `3` and `4` both appear at least 3 times, so `shapes = 2`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(shapes)` statement will print the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the number of unique elements in pl that appear at least 3 times in palka)**
