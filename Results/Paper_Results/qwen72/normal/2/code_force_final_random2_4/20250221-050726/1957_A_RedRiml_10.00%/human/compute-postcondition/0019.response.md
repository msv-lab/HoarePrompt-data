The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is the first element of the list `palka`) to the list `pl`. This means that `pl` now contains the first element of `palka` if it wasn't already there, or it contains the first element again if it was already present.

Let's summarize the output state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
- `w` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `ln` is an input integer.
- `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 2 elements.
- `pl` is a list that now contains the first element of `palka`.
- `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the first element in `palka`), and the value of `d[i]` is 1 if `i` was not already in `pl`, or it is incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `pl`.
