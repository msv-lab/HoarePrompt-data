Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it did not break, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element if such an element exists, otherwise `b` is 0, and `c` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`y`**: After the loop completes, `y` will be the index where the loop broke (i.e., the first index where `l[y] > l[y-1]`). If no such index is found, `y` will be `n-1` because the loop will have iterated through all elements.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`b`**: If there is an element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, `b` will be set to that element. If no such element is found, `b` remains 0.
- **`c`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
