Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the last element in `l` that was greater than or equal to the previous elements up to the point where it was updated, `b` is the last element in `l` that was greater than the previous elements up to the point where it was updated, and `c` is the count of how many times an element in `l` was found to be greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop execution.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer input provided by the user, which must satisfy the condition 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5. All other variables (`t`, `l`, `y`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
