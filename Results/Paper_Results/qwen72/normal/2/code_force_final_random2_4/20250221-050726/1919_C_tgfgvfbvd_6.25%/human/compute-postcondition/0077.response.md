Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the other variables, so their initial states remain unchanged. The value of `c` is now explicitly set to 0.
