Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is 3, `a` is the first element in `l`, `c` is 0, `b` is the fourth element in `l` if `l[3] > l[2]`, otherwise `b` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 3. If `l[3] > l[2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
