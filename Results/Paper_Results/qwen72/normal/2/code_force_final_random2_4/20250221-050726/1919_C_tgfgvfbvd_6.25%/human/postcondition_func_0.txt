The function reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set consists of an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. For each set, it identifies the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor, then iterates through the remaining elements to count how many are greater than two reference values (`a` and `b`). The function prints the count for each set. After processing all sets, the function completes without returning any value.
