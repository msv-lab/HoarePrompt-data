The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range 1 to `n`.

Given these parameters, the function's output is not specified in the provided information. However, based on common programming tasks, it might involve processing the list `a` in some way that depends on the values of `t` and `n`.

Since the exact output is not provided, I will describe the function's functionality based on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n`, an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^5; and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is within the range 1 to `n`. The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the elements of `a`.**
