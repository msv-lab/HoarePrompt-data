Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the first integer in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `c` is 0, `y` is 3. If `l[3]` is greater than `l[2]`, `b` is set to `l[3]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `b` remains as it was initially (0 if `l[1]` is not greater than `l[0]`, otherwise `l[1]`).***
