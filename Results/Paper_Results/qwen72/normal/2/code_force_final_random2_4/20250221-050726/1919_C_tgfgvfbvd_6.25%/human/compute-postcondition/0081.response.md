Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is 1, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is `l[1]`, `c` is 0, and the second element in `l` (i.e., `l[1]`) is greater than the first element in `l` (i.e., `l[0]`).**
