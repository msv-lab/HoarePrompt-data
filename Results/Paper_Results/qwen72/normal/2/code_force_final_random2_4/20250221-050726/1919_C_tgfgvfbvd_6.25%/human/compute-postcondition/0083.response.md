Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is 1, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0. If the second element in `l` (i.e., `l[1]`) is greater than the first element in `l` (i.e., `l[0]`), then `b` is updated to `l[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `y`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
