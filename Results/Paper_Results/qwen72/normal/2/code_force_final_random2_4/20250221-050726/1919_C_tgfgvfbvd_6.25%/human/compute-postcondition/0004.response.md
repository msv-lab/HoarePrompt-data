Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the first integer in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is 0.** 

The variable `b` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `l`) retain their initial values and conditions.
