To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists.
   - `a` is the last element in `l` that was greater than or equal to the previous elements up to the point where it was updated.
   - `b` is the last element in `l` that was greater than the previous elements up to the point where it was updated.
   - `c` is the count of how many times an element in `l` was found to be greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop execution.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `y` is determined by finding the first index where an element in `l` is greater than its previous element. If no such element exists, `y` is set to `n-1`.
   - `a` and `b` are updated during the loop based on the conditions mentioned.
   - `c` is incremented each time an element in `l` is found to be greater than both `a` and `b`.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`, which is the count of how many times an element in `l` was found to be greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop execution.

Given the initial state and the definitions of the variables, the output of the `print(c)` statement will be the value of `c` as described above.

Output: **c (where c is the count of how many times an element in l was found to be greater than both a and b during the loop execution)**
