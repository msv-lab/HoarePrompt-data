The only variables in the loop head are `q` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, which ensures that the loop will execute if `t` is within this range. The variable `q` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0**
