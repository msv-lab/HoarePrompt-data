The value of `ans1` is updated by appending the value of `b[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `ans1` will now contain the value of `b[1]` appended to its existing content, which was already `b[1]` according to the initial state. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` twice.**
