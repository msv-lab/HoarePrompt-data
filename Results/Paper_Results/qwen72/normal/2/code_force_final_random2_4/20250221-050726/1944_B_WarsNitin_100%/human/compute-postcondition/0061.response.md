Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now equal to `req`. If `k` is 0, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`, and `ans2` now includes the value of `c[i]`.**
