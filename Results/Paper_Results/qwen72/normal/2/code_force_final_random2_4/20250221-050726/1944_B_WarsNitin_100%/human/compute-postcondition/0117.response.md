The code `ans1.append(b[n - 1])` appends the last element of the list `b` (which is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order) to the list `ans1`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `ans1` is initially an empty list. After the code executes, `ans1` will contain the last element of `b`.
- The last element of `b` is `b[n - 1]` because `b` is a list of length `n`.
- All other variables (`i`, `l`, `ans2`, `k`, `n`, `req`, `m`, `q`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `-1`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `req` is 0, `m` remains unchanged, `q` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, now sorted in ascending order.**
