The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 1, and `ans1` already contains the value of `b[1]`, appending `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) to `ans1` means that `ans1` will now contain two elements, both of which are the value of `b[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` contains two elements, both equal to `b[1]`.**
