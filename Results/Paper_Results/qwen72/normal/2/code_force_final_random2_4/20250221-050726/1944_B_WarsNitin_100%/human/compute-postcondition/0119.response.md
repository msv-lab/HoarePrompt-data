The code snippet `ans1.append(b[n - 1])` appends the last element of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given that `ans1` already contains the last element of `b` (which is `b[n-1]`), appending `b[n-1]` again will result in `ans1` having two copies of the last element of `b`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `ans1` initially contains the last element of `b` (which is `b[n-1]`).
- After executing the code, `ans1` will contain two copies of `b[n-1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` (which is `b[n-1]`), `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `req` is 0, `m` remains unchanged, `q` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, now sorted in ascending order.**
