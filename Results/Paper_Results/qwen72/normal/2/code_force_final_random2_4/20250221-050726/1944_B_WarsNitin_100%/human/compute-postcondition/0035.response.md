Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` contains two elements, both equal to `b[1]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, and `l` now contains the value of `b[1]`.***
