Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their immediate next element, provided `k` was not `0` before the loop ends, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
