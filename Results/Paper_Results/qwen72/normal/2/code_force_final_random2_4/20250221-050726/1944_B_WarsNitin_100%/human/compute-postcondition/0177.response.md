Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is either `req - 4` or `req - 2`, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their immediate next element, provided `k` is not `0` before the loop ends. If `k` is 0, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is reduced by 2, `ans2` includes the value of `c[2]` and `c[2]` appended to it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[3]` appended to it.***
