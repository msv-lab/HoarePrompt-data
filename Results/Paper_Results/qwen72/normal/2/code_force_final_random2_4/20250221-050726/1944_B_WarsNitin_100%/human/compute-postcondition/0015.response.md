Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is now equal to 2 times its original value, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, `l` is an empty list if the first element of `b` is equal to the second element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`.***
