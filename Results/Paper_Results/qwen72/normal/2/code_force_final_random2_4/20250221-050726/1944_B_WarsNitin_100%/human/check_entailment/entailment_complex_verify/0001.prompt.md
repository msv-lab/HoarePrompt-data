You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `q` is `t - 1`, `ans1` and `ans2` contain the selected elements from `b` and `c` respectively, ensuring that each element in `ans1` and `ans2` is part of the pairs or unique elements as required by `k`. `k` is 0, indicating that the required number of elements has been added to `ans1` and `ans2`. The lists `b` and `c` remain sorted, and `l` contains the unique elements from `b` that were not paired. The original values of `n`, `k` (before modification in the loop), and `req` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. For each test case, it divides the list `a` into two equal parts, `b` and `c`, sorts both parts, and then selects elements to form two new lists, `ans1` and `ans2`. The selection ensures that each list contains pairs of identical elements from `b` and `c`, and possibly some unique elements, based on the value of `k`. The function prints the contents of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state reflects that all test cases have been processed according to the specified rules.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input, including the number of test cases `t`, the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, and the array `a`.

2. **Array Splitting**: The array `a` is split into two halves, `b` and `c`, where `b` contains the first half of `a` and `c` contains the second half.

3. **Sorting**: Both `b` and `c` are sorted. This is necessary to facilitate the selection of pairs of identical elements.

4. **Initialization**: Two lists, `ans1` and `ans2`, are initialized to store the elements of the subsets `l` and `r`, respectively. Another list `l` is used to temporarily store elements that do not form pairs.

5. **Handling Special Cases**:
   - The program checks if the first and last elements of `b` are unique and adds them to `l` if they are.
   - If the last two elements of `b` are the same, they are added to `ans1` and `k` is decremented by 2.

6. **Pair Selection**:
   - The program iterates through the middle elements of `b` to find pairs of identical elements and adds them to `ans1`.
   - Similarly, it iterates through the middle elements of `c` to find pairs of identical elements and adds them to `ans2`.

7. **Balancing Remaining Elements**:
   - If there are any remaining elements in `l`, they are added to both `ans1` and `ans2` to ensure the lengths of `ans1` and `ans2` are equal to `2k`.

8. **Output**: The program prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Unique Elements**: The program incorrectly handles unique elements by adding them to `l` and then trying to balance them later. This can lead to incorrect results if the unique elements are not properly balanced.
- **Incorrect Pair Selection**: The program assumes that the first and last elements of `b` and `c` will be unique, which is not always true. This can lead to incorrect results.
- **Incorrect Balancing**: The program does not ensure that the XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` is the same, which is a requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical issues that can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness:
**False**
