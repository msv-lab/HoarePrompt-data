To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions and variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 1, which means `n` must be greater than 2.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 1, as it is the starting point of the range.

### Adjusting the State:
- **`i`**: Should be 1.
- **`n`**: Must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
Given the initial state and the adjustments needed for the loop to execute, the final state should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
