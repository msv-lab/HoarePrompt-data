Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains the repeated elements from `b` where `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, and `l` contains the unique elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element `b[i + 1]`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `n - 2`:** The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive). After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 2`.
- **`k` is 0:** The loop decrements `k` by 2 each time it finds two consecutive equal elements in `b`. The loop breaks when `k` reaches 0, so after the loop finishes, `k` will be 0.
- **`ans1` contains the repeated elements from `b` where `b[i] == b[i - 1]`:** Each time the loop finds two consecutive elements in `b` that are equal, it appends that element twice to `ans1` and decreases `k` by 2.
- **`l` contains the unique elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element `b[i + 1]`:** Each time the loop finds an element in `b` that is not equal to the next element, it appends that element to `l`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
