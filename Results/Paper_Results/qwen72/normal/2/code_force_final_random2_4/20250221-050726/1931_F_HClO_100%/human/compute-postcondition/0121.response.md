The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a3`, `l3`, and the list `val`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `val`. If `val` contains at least two tuples, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `m-3`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` were set by the first tuple in `val`, and `val` is a list containing at least one tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must contain at least two tuples, and `a3` and `l3` will be set by the second tuple in `val`.

State: **`_` is `m-3`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the second tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least two tuples.**
