Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, checks the conditions for the validity of the screenshots, and prints the appropriate output ("YES" or "NO") based on whether the screenshots can correspond to a single, consistent order of participants. The logic for handling the special cases (like when there is only one screenshot) and the general case (comparing the relative positions of the participants in the screenshots) seems to be implemented correctly. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
