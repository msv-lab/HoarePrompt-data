You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5), where n is the number of chat participants and k is the number of participants who posted screenshots. Each of the k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, all a_{ij} are distinct), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, who is the author of the screenshot. All authors of the screenshots are different.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, meaning for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` was equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`. The final state is that `t` is 0, indicating all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and the program prints 'yes' for each test case. All other variables (`_`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`) retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of lists `a` representing the order of participants shown to the author of each screenshot. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates the order of participants shown to the author of each screenshot.
