To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the components of the loop head:

```python
for (a3, l3) in val:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `(a3, l3)` and `val`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `val` must be an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or other collection) that contains at least one element. Each element in `val` should be a tuple that can be unpacked into `a3` and `l3`.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is `m-3`
   - `m` is greater than 2
   - `a3` is the first integer from the new input
   - `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input
   - `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples, each tuple consisting of `(a3, l3)` from each iteration

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, `val` must contain at least one tuple. Given that `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples, and `m` is greater than 2, `m-2` must be at least 1. This means `m` must be at least 3.
   - The initial values of `a3` and `l3` are already defined, but they will be overwritten by the values in the tuples in `val` during each iteration of the loop.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `val` must be a list containing at least one tuple.
- `m` must be at least 3 to ensure `val` has at least one tuple.
- `a3` and `l3` will be set by the first tuple in `val` when the loop starts.

State: **`_` is `m-3`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the first tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple**
