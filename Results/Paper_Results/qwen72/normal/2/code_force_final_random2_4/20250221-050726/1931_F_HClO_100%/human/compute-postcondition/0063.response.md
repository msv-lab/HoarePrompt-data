Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` and `p2` are either 1 or unchanged. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
