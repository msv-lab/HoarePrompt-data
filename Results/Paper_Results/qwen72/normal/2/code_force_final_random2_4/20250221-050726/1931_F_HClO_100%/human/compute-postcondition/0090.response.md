Postcondition: **_ is 0, t is greater than 0, n is greater than 1, m is 2, a1 is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the input, a2 is the first integer from the new input, l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding a1, i is n-2, idx1 and idx2 are either non-negative or -1, p1 and p2 are either 1 or 0, val is an empty list. If idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1, then idx2 is set to n-2, and idx1 remains a non-negative integer. Additionally, idx1 is less than or equal to idx2.**
