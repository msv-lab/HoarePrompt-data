```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides several details about the variables and objects in the program, but none of these details affect the execution of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- `_`: Set to `m-2`.
- `m`: At least 3.
- `a3` and `l3`: Set by the last tuple in `val`.
- `val`: A list containing at least `m-2` tuples.
- `n`: An input integer.
- `m`: An input integer.
- One line of input has been consumed.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **yes**
