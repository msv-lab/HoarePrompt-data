The only variable in the loop head is `m`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than 2, but since the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 each time, the effective condition is that `m` must be greater than 3.

State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` as its last element.**
