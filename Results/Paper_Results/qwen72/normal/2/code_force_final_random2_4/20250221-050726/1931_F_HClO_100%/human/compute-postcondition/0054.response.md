Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `p2` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `p2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is not evaluated here, so the program continues executing the next statements.
