Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is 1 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is 1 and `p2` is 1.***
