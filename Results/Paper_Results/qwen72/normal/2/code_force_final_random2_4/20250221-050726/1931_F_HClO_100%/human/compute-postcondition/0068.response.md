Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 2, `idx1` and `idx2` are either 1 or non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `idx2` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `p2 = 1` sets the value of `p2` to 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is still valid, but since `p2` is now 1, the condition simplifies to `i + 1 == n - 1`.
- The output state reflects the updated value of `p2` and retains all other conditions and values from the initial state.
