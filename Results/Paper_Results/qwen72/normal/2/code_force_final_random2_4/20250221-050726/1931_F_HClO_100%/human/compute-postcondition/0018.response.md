The `input()` function call reads a line of input from the user but does not assign it to any variable, so it does not affect the values of any existing variables. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `m` must be greater than 2, `l11` and `l22` are not equal.**
