Postcondition: **The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is `n-2`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`, and `l` is now equal to `l2`. If `idx1 >= idx2`, `l1` is updated by inserting `a1` at the position `idx2`, and `l` is now a reference to `l1`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at position `idx2`, and `l` is now a reference to `l1`. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`, and `l` is now equal to `l2`. All other variables (`_`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`) retain their initial values, and `val` is now an empty list.**
