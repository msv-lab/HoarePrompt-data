Postcondition: ***`_` is `m-3`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the first tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as expected.***
