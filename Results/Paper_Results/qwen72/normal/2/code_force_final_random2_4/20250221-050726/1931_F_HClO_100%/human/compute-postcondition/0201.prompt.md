Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer and is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither of these conditions are met, the program continues as per the original conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer and is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the following conditions apply: If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 1 and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, then `idx2` is 1 and `p2` is 1. If `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer and is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the program continues without breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
