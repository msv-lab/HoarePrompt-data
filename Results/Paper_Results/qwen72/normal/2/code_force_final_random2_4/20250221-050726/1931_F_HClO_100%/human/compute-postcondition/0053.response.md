The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. Since `i` is 1, `idx2` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 1, `idx2` is 1. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.**
