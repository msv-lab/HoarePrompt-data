Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is greater than 2, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `a3` is the first integer from the third user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, and `idx2` is `n - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`m` is greater than 2, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `a3` is the first integer from the third user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, and `idx2` is `n - 2`, `a3` and `l3` are the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as it was before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`m` is greater than 2, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `a3` and `l3` are the second tuple in `val`, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`. If `l3` is not equal to a list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is greater than 2, `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `a3` and `l3` are the third tuple in `val`, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`. If `l3` is not equal to a list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
