Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, meaning for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` was equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`. The final state is that `m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and the program prints 'yes'. All other variables (`_`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`) retain their initial values.**
