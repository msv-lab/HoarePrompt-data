The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than or equal to 3 (since `m - 2` must be greater than 0), and `_` will be incremented by 1.

However, since `_` is not used in the loop condition and is just a placeholder, it does not affect the loop's execution. The key variable here is `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 2**
