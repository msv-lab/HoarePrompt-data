Output State: **`a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, and `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l2` now includes `a2` inserted at the position specified by `idx1`, `l` is now equal to `l2`. If `m` is 2, `i` is `n-2`, and the conditions involving `idx1`, `idx2`, and `p2` are as described in the initial state. If `m` is not 2, all variables retain their initial values.**
