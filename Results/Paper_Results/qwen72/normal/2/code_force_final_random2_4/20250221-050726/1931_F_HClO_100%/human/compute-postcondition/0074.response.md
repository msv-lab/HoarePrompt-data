Output State: **_ is 0, t is greater than 0, n is greater than 1, m are input integers, a1 is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the input, a2 is the first integer from the new input, l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding a1, i is n-2, idx1 and idx2 are either non-negative or -1, p1 and p2 are either 1 or 0. If l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2], and if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1, then idx1 and idx2 are both set to i, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative, the loop breaks. If l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2], the loop continues until the condition i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1 is met, at which point the loop terminates.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the variable `i` will be `n-2` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`). The variables `idx1` and `idx2` will either be non-negative (indicating that certain conditions were met during the loop) or remain `-1` if those conditions were never met. The variables `p1` and `p2` will be either `1` or `0` depending on whether certain conditions were met during the loop. The loop will terminate when the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is true, or when specific conditions cause a break within the loop. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
