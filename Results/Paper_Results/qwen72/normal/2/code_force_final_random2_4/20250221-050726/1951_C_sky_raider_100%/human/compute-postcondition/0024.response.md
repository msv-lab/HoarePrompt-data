To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is the number of iterations the loop has executed
- `m` remains an integer read from the input
- `k` is `k - n * s`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `t` is `n * s`
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration
- `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`

The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. The value of `int(input())` is determined by user input and cannot be adjusted within the loop itself.

2. **Adjusting `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes `n`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `i` is less than `int(input())`. Since `i` is now `n`, the loop will execute if `n` is less than `int(input())`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the number of iterations the loop has executed
- `m` remains an integer read from the input
- `k` is `k - n * s`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `t` is `n * s`
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration
- `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `m` remains an integer read from the input, `k` is `k - n * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`**
