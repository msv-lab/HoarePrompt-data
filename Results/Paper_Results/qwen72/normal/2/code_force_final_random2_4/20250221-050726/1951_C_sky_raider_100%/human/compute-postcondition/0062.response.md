Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t)`**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `c` is `s * l[0]`.
- The code `c += s * (l[i] + t)` updates `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value.
- Since `i` is 1, `l[i]` is `l[1]`.
- `t` is equal to `s`.
- Therefore, `c` becomes `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t)`, which simplifies to `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + s)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
