Output State: **`i` is `n` (initial value), `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `t` is 0, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `t` to 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `t` was previously `n * s`, but now it is explicitly set to 0.
- The calculation for `c` remains the same, but since `t` is now 0, `c` will be the sum of `s * l[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
