The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0]`**
