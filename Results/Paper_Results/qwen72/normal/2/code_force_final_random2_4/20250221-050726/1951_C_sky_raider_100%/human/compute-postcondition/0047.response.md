To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1` after the loop completes.
   - `n` remains the same as the initial value.
   - `m` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `k` is updated to `k - n * s` where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial `k`.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input.
   - `t` is `n * s`.
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` (which may change with each iteration).
   - `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is a fixed integer.
   - `m` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `k` is initially some value and gets updated to `k - n * s` where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial `k`.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input.
   - `t` is `n * s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
   - `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Calculating `c`:**
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
   - `t` is `n * s`.
   - For each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, the term `s * (l[j] + t)` is computed and summed up to get `c`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Since `t` is `n * s`, the term `l[j] + t` becomes `l[j] + n * s`.
   - Therefore, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + n * s)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

5. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - `c = s * (l[0] + n * s) + s * (l[1] + n * s) + ... + s * (l[n-1] + n * s)`
   - `c = s * (l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1] + n * s + n * s + ... + n * s)`
   - `c = s * (sum(l) + n * s * n)`
   - `c = s * (sum(l) + n^2 * s)`
   - `c = s * sum(l) + s * n^2 * s`
   - `c = s * sum(l) + s^2 * n^2`

6. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `c` is `s * sum(l) + s^2 * n^2`.
   - The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c`.

Output: **int(s * sum(l) + s^2 * n^2) (where s is the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, and n is the initial value of n)**
