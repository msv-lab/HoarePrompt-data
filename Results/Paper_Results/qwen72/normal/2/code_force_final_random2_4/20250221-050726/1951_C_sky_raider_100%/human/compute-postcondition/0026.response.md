Output State: **`i` is `n` (initial value), `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `t` is `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `l`.
- The previous values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input.
