### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - Sorting the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order is a key step. This ensures that the program always considers the cheapest available tickets first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0.
     - `t` keeps track of the total number of tickets purchased so far.
     - `s` represents the number of tickets to purchase on the current day.
     - `c` accumulates the total cost of purchasing tickets.

4. **Ticket Purchase Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices.
   - For each day, the number of tickets to purchase `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and `k` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - The cost `c` is updated by adding the product of `s` and the current day's price plus the total tickets purchased so far `t`.
   - The total tickets purchased `t` is incremented by `s`.
   - The remaining tickets needed `k` is decremented by `s`.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the total cost `c` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The approach of sorting the ticket prices and always buying the cheapest available tickets first is optimal for minimizing the total cost.
  - The constraints are handled correctly, ensuring that the number of tickets purchased per day does not exceed `m` and the total number of tickets purchased equals `k`.
  - The logic for updating the cost and the number of tickets purchased is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
