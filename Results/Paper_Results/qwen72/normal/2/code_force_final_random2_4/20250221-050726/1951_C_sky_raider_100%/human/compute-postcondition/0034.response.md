The value of `t` is incremented by the value of `s`. Since `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, the new value of `t` is `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `t` is `s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0]`**.
