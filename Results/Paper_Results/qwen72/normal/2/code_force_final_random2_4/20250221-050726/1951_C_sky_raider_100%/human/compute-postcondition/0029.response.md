Output State: **`i` is `n` (initial value), `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `t` is 0, `s` is 0, `c` is the sum of `0 * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is set to 0, which overrides its previous value, which was the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration. The value of `c` is now the sum of `0 * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, which simplifies to 0 because multiplying by 0 results in 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
