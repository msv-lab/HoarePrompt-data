To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `m` is an integer read from the input
- `k` is `k - 2 * s`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `t` is `2 * s`
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
- `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t)`
- `s` is updated to the minimum of `m` and `k`

### Code Snippet:
```python
c += s * (l[i] + t)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the variables involved:**
   - `c` is the variable being updated.
   - `s` is the value used in the calculation.
   - `l` is the list of integers.
   - `i` is the index used to access the list.
   - `t` is a constant value.

2. **Calculate the new value of `c`:**
   - The current value of `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t)`.
   - The new value of `c` will be `c + s * (l[i] + t)`.
   - Since `i` is 2, the expression becomes `c + s * (l[2] + t)`.

3. **Update the value of `c`:**
   - The new value of `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`.

### Output State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `m` is an integer read from the input
- `k` is `k - 2 * s`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `t` is `2 * s`
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
- `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer read from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `2 * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`**.
