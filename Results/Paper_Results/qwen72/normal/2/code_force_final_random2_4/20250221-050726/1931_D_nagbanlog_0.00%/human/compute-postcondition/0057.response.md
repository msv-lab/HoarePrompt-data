To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary.
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases.
   - `case` is the second test case in the `test_cases` list.
   - `results` is a list containing one element, which is `beautiful_count`.
   - `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

2. **Variables to be Printed:**
   - `num`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to infer its value. Since `mod_x` and `mod_y` are derived from `num`, `num` must be a number that is being processed in the context of the test case.
   - `mod_x`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: Calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y`: Equal to `mod_y`.

Given that `num` is not explicitly defined, we can assume it is part of the test case data. For the sake of this example, let's assume `num` is a specific value from the test case. Let's say `num = 10`, `x = 3`, and `y = 4` (these values are hypothetical and should be replaced with actual values from the test case).

3. **Calculations:**
   - `mod_x = num % x = 10 % 3 = 1`
   - `mod_y = num % y = 10 % 4 = 2`
   - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x = (3 - 1) % 3 = 2 % 3 = 2`
   - `required_mod_y = mod_y = 2`

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`.

Since the exact values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are not provided in the initial state, we will use the hypothetical values to illustrate the output. If you provide the actual values from the test case, the output can be more precise.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y] (where [num] is the value of num, [mod_x] is the remainder of num divided by x, [mod_y] is the remainder of num divided by y, [required_mod_x] is (x - mod_x) % x, and [required_mod_y] is mod_y)**

For the hypothetical values:
Output: **Number: 10, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 2, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 2**
