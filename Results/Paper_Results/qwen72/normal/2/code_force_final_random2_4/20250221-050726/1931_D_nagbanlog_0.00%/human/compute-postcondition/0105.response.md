Postcondition: **`freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in `freq`. `results` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`, `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. Additionally, the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not a key in the dictionary `freq`.**
