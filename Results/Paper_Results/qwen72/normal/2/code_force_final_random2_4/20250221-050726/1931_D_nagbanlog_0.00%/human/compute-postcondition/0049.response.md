Output State: **`freq` is an empty dictionary, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is now equal to `case['array']`, `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number by adding a non-negative integer less than `x` such that the resulting number is divisible by both `x` and `y`.**
