You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, x, and y (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), where n is the size of the array and x and y are Polycarp's favorite integers; the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), which are the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `freq` dictionary for each test case will contain the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array `a` of that test case. The `beautiful_count` for each test case represents the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged as they were before the loop started.
    return results
    #The program returns the list `results` which contains `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. Each `beautiful_count` represents the total count of numbers in the array `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case includes a tuple `(n, x, y)` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of pairs in the corresponding array `a` whose sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `results` which contains `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. Each `beautiful_count` represents the total count of numbers in the array `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
