The code snippet calculates the value of `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. Let's break down the impact:

- `required_mod_x` is calculated using the formula `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `x` and `mod_x` are already defined in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case
- `case` is the first test case in the list
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`
- `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`
- `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`
- `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element
- `freq` is an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0
- `num` is the first element of `a`
- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`
- `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`

After executing the code:
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**
