The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases, where each test case is a dictionary containing a tuple `(n, x, y)` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case to count the number of pairs in the array `a` such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of such pairs for the corresponding test case. All input variables remain unchanged after the function execution.
