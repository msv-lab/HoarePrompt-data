Output State: **`freq` is an empty dictionary, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates the value of `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `required_mod_x` is now specifically defined as the result of the expression `(x - mod_x) % x`.
