The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already specified as an input integer between 1 and 100, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
