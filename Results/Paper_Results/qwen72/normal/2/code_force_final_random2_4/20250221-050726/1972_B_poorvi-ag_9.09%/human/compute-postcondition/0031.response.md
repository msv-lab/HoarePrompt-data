The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, but since `i` is being used as an iterator over `results`, the actual state that affects the loop's execution is the state of `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is not empty.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100,
- `i` is `t-1`,
- `n` is the last input integer,
- `arr` is the last input string,
- `results` is a list of length `t`.

For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. Since `results` is defined as a list of length `t` and `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `results` will always have at least one element (since the minimum value of `t` is 1).

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as `results` is already guaranteed to have elements based on the given conditions.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list of length `t` and contains at least one element**
