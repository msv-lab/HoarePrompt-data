Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `arr`. Since the input is taken from the user, it is treated as a string. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
