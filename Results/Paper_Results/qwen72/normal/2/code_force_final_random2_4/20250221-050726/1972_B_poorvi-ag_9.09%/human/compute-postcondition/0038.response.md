The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins. Additionally, the function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.

For each test case, the function processes the initial state of the coins and returns the result of the processing. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.
