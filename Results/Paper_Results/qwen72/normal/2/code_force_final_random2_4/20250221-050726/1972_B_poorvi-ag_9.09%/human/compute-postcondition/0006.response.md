The code appends the string 'no' to the list `results`. This changes the state of the `results` list from being empty to containing one element, which is the string 'no'. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing ['no'], `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is even, `arr` is an input string.**
