Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is an input string. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing ['no']. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing ['yes'] if the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters; otherwise, `results` is a list containing ['no'].***
