The code appends the string 'yes' to the list `results`. This impacts the `results` list, which now includes one additional element.

- If `n` is even, `results` initially contains ['no', 'no'], and after appending 'yes', it becomes ['no', 'no', 'yes'].
- If `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, `results` initially contains ['yes', 'no'] if `n` is even, or ['yes', 'yes'] if `n` is odd. After appending 'yes', it becomes ['yes', 'no', 'yes'] if `n` is even, or ['yes', 'yes', 'yes'] if `n` is odd.
- Otherwise, `results` initially contains ['no', 'no'] if `n` is even, or ['yes', 'no'] if `n` is odd. After appending 'yes', it becomes ['no', 'no', 'yes'] if `n` is even, or ['yes', 'no', 'yes'] if `n` is odd.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `arr` is a new input string, and `results` is a list containing one additional 'yes' at the end.**
