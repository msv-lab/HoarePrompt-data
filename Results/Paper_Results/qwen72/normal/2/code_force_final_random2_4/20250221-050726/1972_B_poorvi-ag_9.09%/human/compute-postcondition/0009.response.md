The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. This changes the state of the `results` list from being empty to containing one element, which is the string `'yes'`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing ['yes'], `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is odd, `arr` is an input string, and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters in `arr`.**
