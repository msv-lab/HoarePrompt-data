The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If there are elements left in `results`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, and `results` is a list of length `t` and contains at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain elements. Since `i` is being iterated over the elements of `results`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `results`.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is the next element in `results`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list of length `t` and contains at least two elements**
