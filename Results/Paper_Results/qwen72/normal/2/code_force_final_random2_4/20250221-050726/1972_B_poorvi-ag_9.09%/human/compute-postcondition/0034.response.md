To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is the next element in `results`.
   - `n` is the last input integer.
   - `arr` is the last input string.
   - `results` is a list of length `t` and contains at least two elements.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is the length of the `results` list.
   - `i` is the next element in the `results` list. This means `i` is the element at the current index being processed in the `results` list.
   - `n` and `arr` are mentioned but not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.

3. **Execution of the Code:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is the next element in the `results` list.

Since `i` is the next element in the `results` list, and the `results` list contains at least two elements, the value of `i` will be one of the elements in the `results` list. Without knowing the specific values in the `results` list, we can only describe `i` as the next element in the list.

Output: **i (where i is the next element in the results list)**
