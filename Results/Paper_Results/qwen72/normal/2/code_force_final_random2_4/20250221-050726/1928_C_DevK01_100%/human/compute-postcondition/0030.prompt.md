Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: q and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, M is an empty list or contains the integer value of w if w is an integer and w is greater than or equal to x - 1, w is the square root of q, i is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < w:
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 2, and `M` is `[1, q]` if `i` was greater than or equal to `x - 1` (which is always true since `i` is 1), otherwise `M` is `[q]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 3, and `M` is either `[1, q, 2]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2]` depending on the conditions.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 4, and `M` remains as `[1, q, 2, 3]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2, 3]` or `[1, q, 2, 3, q // 3]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2, 3, q // 3]` depending on the initial conditions.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
