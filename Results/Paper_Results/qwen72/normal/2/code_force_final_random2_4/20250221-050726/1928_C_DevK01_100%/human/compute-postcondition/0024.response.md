Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 3, and `M` is either `[1, q, 2, 3]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2, 3]` depending on the conditions.**

Explanation:
- The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `M`.
- The initial state specifies that `M` can be either `[1, q, 2]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2]` depending on certain conditions.
- After appending `3` to `M`, the new list `M` will be `[1, q, 2, 3]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2, 3]` depending on the original condition.
- All other variables (`q`, `x`, `w`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
