Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 2, and `M` is `[1, q, 2]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `M`. Initially, `M` is `[1, q]` because `i` (which is 2) is greater than or equal to `x - 1` (since `i` is 2 and `x` is at least 1). After appending `i` to `M`, the new value of `M` is `[1, q, 2]`. The values of `q`, `x`, and `w` remain unchanged.
