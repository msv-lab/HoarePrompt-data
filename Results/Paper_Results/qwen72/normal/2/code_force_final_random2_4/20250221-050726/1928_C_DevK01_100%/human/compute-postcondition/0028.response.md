Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, and `i` is 3. If `q % i == 0`, and if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is either `[1, q, 2, 3, q // 3]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2, 3, q // 3]` depending on the initial conditions. Otherwise, `M` remains as `[1, q, 2, 3]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2, 3]` depending on the initial conditions. If `q % i != 0`, `M` remains as `[1, q, 2]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2]` depending on the initial conditions.***
