The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where `q` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) and `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < q\). It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, including both the divisor and its corresponding quotient if the quotient is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is also included in the list `M`.
