The code snippet `M += [q // i]` appends the integer division result of `q` by `i` to the list `M`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).
- `M` is a list containing the integer value `[1]` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- `w` is the square root of `q`.
- `i` is 1.
- `q` is divisible by `i` (which is 1).
- The quotient of `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- If `i` is less than `x - 1`, `M` remains an empty list.

Since `i` is 1, `q // i` is simply `q`. The list `M` will be updated to include this value.

If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` initially contains `[1]`. After appending `q`, `M` becomes `[1, q]`.

If `i` is less than `x - 1`, `M` is initially an empty list. After appending `q`, `M` becomes `[q]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 1, `q` is divisible by `i`, the quotient of `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is `[1, q]`. If `i` is less than `x - 1`, `M` is `[q]`.**
