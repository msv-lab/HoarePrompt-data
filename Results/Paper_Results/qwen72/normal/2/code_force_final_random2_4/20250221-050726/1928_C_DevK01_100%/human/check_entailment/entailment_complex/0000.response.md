### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves determining the number of possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position (`n`) and the number he received (`x`).
   - The pattern of numbering repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the sequence alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of length `k`.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` because no valid `k` can satisfy the conditions.
   - If `y` is even, it calls `func_1` with arguments `(y - 2) // 2` and `x` to find potential values of `k`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and calls `func_1` again with arguments `(n - x) // 2` and `x` to find additional potential values of `k`.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` takes two parameters `q` and `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `M` to store potential values of `k`.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds it to `M`.
   - It iterates through all integers `i` from `1` to `w` (the square root of `q`), checking if `i` is a divisor of `q`. If `i` is a divisor and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `i` to `M`. It also adds the corresponding quotient `q // i` if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the condition where `y` is odd by printing `0`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, including both the divisor and its corresponding quotient.
   - The combination of results from both calls to `func_1` and the removal of duplicates ensures that all unique valid values of `k` are counted.
   - The logic for determining the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints is sound and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
