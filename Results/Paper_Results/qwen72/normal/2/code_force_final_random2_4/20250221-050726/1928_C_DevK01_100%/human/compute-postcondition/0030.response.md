Output State: **After all iterations, `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is equal to `w`, and `M` contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, including both the divisor and its corresponding quotient if the quotient is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`q` and `x`**: These values remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`w`**: This is the square root of `q` and remains constant.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `w` because the loop increments `i` by 1 until it reaches `w`.
- **`M`**: The list `M` will contain all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. For each divisor `i` that meets this condition, both `i` and `q // i` (if `q // i` is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`) will be added to `M`.

This means that `M` will include all pairs of factors of `q` where both factors are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If `q` is a perfect square, the square root of `q` will be included in `M` only once.
