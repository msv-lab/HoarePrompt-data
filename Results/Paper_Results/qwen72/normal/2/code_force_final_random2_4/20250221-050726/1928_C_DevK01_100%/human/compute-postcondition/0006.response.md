To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).
- `M` is an empty list or contains the integer value of `w` if `w` is an integer and \(w \geq x - 1\).
- `w` is the square root of `q`.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Condition:
```
while i < w:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `i` is less than `w`.
- Currently, `i` is 1.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- We need to ensure that `w` is greater than 1.
- Since `w` is the square root of `q`, `w` will be greater than 1 if `q` is greater than 1.
- Given the constraints \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `q` is already greater than 1 (since \(x\) is at least 1 and \(x < q\)).

### Conclusion:
- The current state already ensures that `w` is greater than 1 because `q` is greater than 1.
- No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is an empty list or contains the integer value of `w` if `w` is an integer and \(w \geq x - 1\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 1**.
