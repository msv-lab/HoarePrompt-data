Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
    a = a[::-1]
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` has `n` elements and the elements of `a` are reversed as described, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `[(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1]), (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` results in an error, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same, `a` is `[(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-2], ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `0`, `line` is the new input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `line` and converting each element to an integer.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
