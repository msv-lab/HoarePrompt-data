To determine what will be printed when the `print(result)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `line` is an input string.
   - `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer.
   - `a` is a list constructed as follows:
     - The last element of `a` is `1000`.
     - The second-to-last element of `a` is `1000 - T[0]`.
     - The third-to-last element of `a` is `1000 - T[0] - T[1]`.
     - And so on, until the first element of `a` which is `1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]`.
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
   - `t` results in an error (this is not relevant to the `print(result)` statement).

2. **Constructing the List `a`:**
   - The list `a` is constructed by starting with `1000` and subtracting the cumulative sum of elements from `T` in reverse order.
   - For example, if `T = [100, 200, 300]` and `n = 4`, then:
     - `a[0] = 1000 - 100 - 200 - 300 = 400`
     - `a[1] = 1000 - 100 - 200 = 700`
     - `a[2] = 1000 - 100 = 900`
     - `a[3] = 1000`

3. **Constructing the String `result`:**
   - The string `result` is created by joining the elements of `a` with spaces.
   - For the example above, `result` would be `"400 700 900 1000"`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`.

Given the initial state and the construction of `a` and `result`, the output will be:

Output: **"1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2] 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-3] ... 1000 - T[0] 1000" (where each term is the result of the corresponding subtraction as described)**

For a concrete example, if `T = [100, 200, 300]` and `n = 4`, the output would be:

Output: **"400 700 900 1000"**
