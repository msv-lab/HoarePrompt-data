Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2])`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` results in an error, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer that determines the number of iterations.
- **`a`**: The list `a` starts with `[1000]`. For each iteration `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the loop appends the value `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to the list `a`. This means that after `n-1` iterations, `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`.
- **`result`**: The variable `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces. Since `a` has been updated, `result` will reflect these changes.
- **`t`**: The variable `t` still results in an error, as it was not modified by the loop.
- **`line`**: The variable `line` remains unchanged as it is the input string used to initialize `T`.
- **`T`**: The list `T` remains unchanged as it is derived from the input string `line` and is not modified by the loop.
