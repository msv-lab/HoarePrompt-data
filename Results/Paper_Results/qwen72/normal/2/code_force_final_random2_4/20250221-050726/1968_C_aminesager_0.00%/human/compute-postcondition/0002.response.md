The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, representing the number of remaining test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
