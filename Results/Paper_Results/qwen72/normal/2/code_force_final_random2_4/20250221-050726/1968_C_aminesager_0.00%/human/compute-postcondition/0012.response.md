Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` has four elements: `a[0]`, `a[1]` which is `a[0] - T[0]`, `a[2]` which is `(a[0] - T[0]) - T[1]`, and `a[3]` which is `((a[0] - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`, which is `(a[0] - T[0]) - T[1]`. Therefore, the new element `a[3]` is `((a[0] - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
