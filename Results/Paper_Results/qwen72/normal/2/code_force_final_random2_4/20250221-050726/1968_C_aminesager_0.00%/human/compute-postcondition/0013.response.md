Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, and `a` has `n` elements. The elements of `a` are calculated as follows: `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 - T[0]`, `a[2]` is `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`, and so on, up to `a[n-1]` which is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`.**

This means that after the loop completes, the list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element is derived by starting with 1000 and subtracting the cumulative sum of the elements from the list `T` up to the current index. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
