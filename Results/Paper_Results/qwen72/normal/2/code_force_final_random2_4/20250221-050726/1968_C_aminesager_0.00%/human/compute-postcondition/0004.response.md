The line of code `line = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, representing the number of remaining test cases. `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. For each test case, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `line` is a string containing the input provided by the user.**
