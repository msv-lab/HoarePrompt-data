#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The total number of test cases t is also provided, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `results` contains `t` elements, each being 'YES' if the corresponding `num_up_coins` was odd, or 'NO' if it was even. The variable `t` is 0, and the loop has completed its execution.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is greater than 0, `results` contains exactly `t` elements, each being 'YES' if the corresponding `num_up_coins` was odd, or 'NO' if it was even. The loop has printed each element in `results` exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`. If the count is odd, it appends "YES" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "NO". After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in the results list. The final state of the program is that the results list contains exactly `t` elements, each being "YES" if the corresponding count of "U" was odd, or "NO" if it was even, and these results have been printed to the standard output.
