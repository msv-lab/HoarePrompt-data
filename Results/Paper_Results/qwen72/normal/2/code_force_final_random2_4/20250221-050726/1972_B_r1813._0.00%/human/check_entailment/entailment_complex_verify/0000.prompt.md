You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The total number of test cases t is also provided, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `results` contains `t` elements, each being 'YES' if the corresponding `num_up_coins` was odd, or 'NO' if it was even. The variable `t` is 0, and the loop has completed its execution.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is greater than 0, `results` contains exactly `t` elements, each being 'YES' if the corresponding `num_up_coins` was odd, or 'NO' if it was even. The loop has printed each element in `results` exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`. If the count is odd, it appends "YES" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "NO". After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in the results list. The final state of the program is that the results list contains exactly `t` elements, each being "YES" if the corresponding count of "U" was odd, or "NO" if it was even, and these results have been printed to the standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s`.
   - If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins (since she goes first and can always make a move that leaves an even number of 'U' coins for Bob).
   - If the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob wins (since Alice will eventually leave an even number of 'U' coins for Bob, and Bob can always make a move that leaves an odd number of 'U' coins for Alice).

3. **Output**: The program appends the result ('YES' or 'NO') to a list and prints each result after processing all test cases.

The logic is sound because the game's outcome is determined by the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Since the game is guaranteed to end in a finite number of moves and one player will always win, the program correctly determines the winner based on the initial state of the coins. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
