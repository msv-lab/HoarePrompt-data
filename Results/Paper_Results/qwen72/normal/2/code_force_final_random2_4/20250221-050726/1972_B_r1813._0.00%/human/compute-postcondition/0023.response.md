Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is the value of `data[4]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`, if `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing two elements ['YES', 'YES'], if `num_up_coins` is even, `results` is a list containing two elements ['NO', 'YES'].** 

Explanation: The code appends 'YES' to the `results` list. The initial state specifies that `results` contains either ['YES'] or ['NO'] depending on whether `num_up_coins` is odd or even. After appending 'YES', the `results` list now contains two elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
