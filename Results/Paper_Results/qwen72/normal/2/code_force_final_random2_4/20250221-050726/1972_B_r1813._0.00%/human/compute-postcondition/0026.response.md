The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is the value of `data[4]`, and `num_up_coins` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is the value of `data[4]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing two elements ['YES', 'YES'] or ['YES', 'NO']. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` is a list containing two elements ['NO', 'YES'] or ['NO', 'NO']**.
