Reasoning:  
The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases as required. It counts the number of "U" (up-facing) coins in each test case and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. According to the problem statement, if the number of up-facing coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make the first move and force Bob into a losing position. Conversely, if the number of up-facing coins is even, Bob will win because Alice will eventually be forced into a position where she cannot make a move.

The logic implemented in the program aligns with this reasoning:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins and the string representing their states.
- It counts the number of "U" coins.
- It appends "YES" to the results list if the count is odd, indicating Alice wins.
- It appends "NO" to the results list if the count is even, indicating Bob wins.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem's constraints and the provided execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
