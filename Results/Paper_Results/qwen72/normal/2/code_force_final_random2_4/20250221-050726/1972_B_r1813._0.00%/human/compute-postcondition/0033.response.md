The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This means that the `results` list, which initially contained either `['YES', 'YES']`, `['YES', 'NO']`, `['NO', 'YES']`, or `['NO', 'NO']`, now has an additional element `'NO'` appended to it.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `index` is 7, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `s` is the value of `data[6]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s` (which is the value of `data[6]`), if `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing three elements ['YES', 'YES', 'NO'] or ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'], if `num_up_coins` is even, `results` is a list containing three elements ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'] or ['NO', 'NO', 'NO']**.
