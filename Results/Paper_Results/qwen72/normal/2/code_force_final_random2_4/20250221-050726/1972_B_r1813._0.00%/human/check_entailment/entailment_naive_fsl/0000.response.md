Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s`.
   - If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins (since she goes first and can always make a move that leaves an even number of 'U' coins for Bob).
   - If the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob wins (since Alice will eventually leave an even number of 'U' coins for Bob, and Bob can always make a move that leaves an odd number of 'U' coins for Alice).

3. **Output**: The program appends the result ('YES' or 'NO') to a list and prints each result after processing all test cases.

The logic is sound because the game's outcome is determined by the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Since the game is guaranteed to end in a finite number of moves and one player will always win, the program correctly determines the winner based on the initial state of the coins. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
