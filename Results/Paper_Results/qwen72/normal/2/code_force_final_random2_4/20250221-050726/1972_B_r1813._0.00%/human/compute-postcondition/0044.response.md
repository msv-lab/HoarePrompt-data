The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The total number of test cases `t` is also provided, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.

For each test case, the function processes the input and returns the result based on the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The function processes each test case and returns the result for each case.**
