Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `results` is a list that contains at least one element, which can be either 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `result`**: The code snippet uses a variable named `result`, but this variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, given the context, it is reasonable to assume that `result` is intended to be an element from the `results` list.
2. **List `results`**: The list `results` contains at least one element, which can be either 'YES' or 'NO'. Since the code snippet does not specify which element of `results` is being printed, we can only conclude that `result` will be one of these two values.

### Conclusion:
The `print(result)` statement will print either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the value of `result` at the time of execution. Since the exact value of `result` is not specified, we can only describe the possible outputs.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where result is an element from the results list)**
