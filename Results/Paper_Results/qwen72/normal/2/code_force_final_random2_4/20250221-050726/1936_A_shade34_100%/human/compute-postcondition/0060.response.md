The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `pans`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `pans`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `pans` must have at least 3 elements (since `i` starts from 1 and the loop condition is `i < len(pans)`).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n`, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n`, `mak` is `n-1` if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 3 elements.**
