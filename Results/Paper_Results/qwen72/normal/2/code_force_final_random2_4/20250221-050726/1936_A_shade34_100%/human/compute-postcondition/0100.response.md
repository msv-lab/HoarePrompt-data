Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 0, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is `<`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `mak` is now 0, while the rest of the variables retain their original values.
