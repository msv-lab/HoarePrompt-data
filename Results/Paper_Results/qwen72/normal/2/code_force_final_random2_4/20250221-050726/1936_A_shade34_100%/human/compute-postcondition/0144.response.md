Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is a new input positive integer greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `pans`.
   - `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`.
   - `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
   - `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `'!'`, followed by the value of `mak2`, and then the value of `pans[mak]`.
   - `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
   - `pans[mak]` is the value at the index `mak` in the list `pans`, where `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
- The exclamation mark `'!'`.
- The value of `mak2`, which is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- The value of `pans[mak]`, which is the value at the index `mak` in the list `pans`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! [mak2] [pans[mak]] (where mak2 is the highest value of i for which the user input was <, and pans[mak] is the value at the index mak in the list pans, where mak is the index of the last element in pans for which the user input was >)**
