Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is either 0 or 3 depending on the user input, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called to ensure that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 3. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
