Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - If the user input is a string that equals `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `mak`:**
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input.
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 1.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, then `mak` remains 0.

4. **Determine the Values of Other Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will print the following:
     - A question mark (`?`)
     - The value of `mak` twice
     - The value of `i` twice

6. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is 1.
     - Output: **? 1 1 3 3**
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, then `mak` is 0.
     - Output: **? 0 0 3 3**

Since the user input is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both cases:

- If the user input is `<`:
  Output: **? 1 1 3 3**

- If the user input is anything other than `<`:
  Output: **? 0 0 3 3**

Given the task, we should provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition. Since the user input is not specified, we must consider both possibilities.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 1 if the user input is `<` and 0 otherwise)**
