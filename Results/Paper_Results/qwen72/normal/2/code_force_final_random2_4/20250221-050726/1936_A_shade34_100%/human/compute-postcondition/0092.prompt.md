Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the output buffer has been flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is updated to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is updated to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is either 0 or 3 depending on the user input, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called to ensure that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 3. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
