Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak` is 1 if `s` is `<`, otherwise `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is 0.
   - `s` is the string input by the user.
   - If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[1]`.
   - If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`.
   - If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `pans` is `[1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mak` depends on the value of `s`:
     - If `s` is `<`, then `mak` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is always 0.
   - `i` is always 2.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `s` is `<`:
     - `mak` is 1.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - `i` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 0 2 0`.
   - If `s` is `=` or any other value:
     - `mak` is 0.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - `i` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 0`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the output will be one of the two possible results based on the value of `s`.

Output: **? [mak] 0 2 0 (where [mak] is 1 if s is `<`, otherwise [mak] is 0)**
