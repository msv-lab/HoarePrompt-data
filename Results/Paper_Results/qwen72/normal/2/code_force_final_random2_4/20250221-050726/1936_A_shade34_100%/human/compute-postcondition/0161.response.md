Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
- `n` is a new input positive integer greater than 1 (This variable is also not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
- `i` is 3.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.
- If the user input is `<`, `mak` is updated to 2.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print a string with the following components:
  - The string `'?'`.
  - The value of `mak` (which is 0 unless the user input was `<`, in which case it would be 2).
  - The value of `mak` again.
  - The value of `i` (which is 3).
  - The value of `i` again.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If the user input was not `<`:**
   - `mak` remains 0.
   - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 3 3`.

2. **If the user input was `<`:**
   - `mak` is updated to 2.
   - The print statement will output: `? 2 2 3 3`.

### Conclusion:
Since the initial state does not specify the user input, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the most precise and general answer based on the given initial state is:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 0 if the user input was not `<`, and 2 if the user input was `<`)**
