Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 2, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the new input string. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1, 2]`. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[1, 2]` if it was initially `[1]`, or `[0, 2]` if it was initially `[0]`. For any other value of `s`, `pans` remains `[0]` if it was initially `[0]`, or becomes `[2]` if it was initially an empty list.***
