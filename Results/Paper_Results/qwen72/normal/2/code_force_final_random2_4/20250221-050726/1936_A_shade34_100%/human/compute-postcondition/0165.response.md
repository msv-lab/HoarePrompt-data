Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variable `mak` is updated to the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- The variable `mak2` is also the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.
- The variables `_` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
