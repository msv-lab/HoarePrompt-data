The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `pans`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `pans`. The loop iterates over the indices of `pans` starting from 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, the list `pans` must have at least 4 elements to ensure that the loop can iterate over the index 3.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 3, `mak` is 1 if the user input is not `>`, otherwise `mak` is 2, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**
