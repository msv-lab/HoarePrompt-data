Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` is 2.
- `mak` is 1 if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`pans` List**: 
   - `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.
   - Since `i` is 2, `pans[2]` will be one of these values.

2. **`mak` Variable**:
   - `mak` is 1 if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` is 0.
   - This means `pans[mak]` will either be `pans[0]` or `pans[1]` depending on the value of `mak`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - It will then print `pans[mak]` twice.
   - It will then print `pans[i]` twice, where `i` is 2.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `mak` is 0 (user input was not `>`):
  - The print statement will be: `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[2] pans[2]`
- If `mak` is 1 (user input was `>`):
  - The print statement will be: `? pans[1] pans[1] pans[2] pans[2]`

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, and `pans[2]` are not provided, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]` if `mak` is 0, and `pans[1]` if `mak` is 1, and `pans[2]` is the third value in the `pans` list)**
