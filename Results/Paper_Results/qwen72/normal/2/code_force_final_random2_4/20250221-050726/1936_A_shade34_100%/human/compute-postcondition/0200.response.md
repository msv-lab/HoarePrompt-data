To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0) (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `i` is `n-1` (This variable is used in the loop head, but it will be reassigned by the loop, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `mak` is 0 (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute, `len(pans)` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `pans`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `pans` must have at least 2 elements.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements**.
