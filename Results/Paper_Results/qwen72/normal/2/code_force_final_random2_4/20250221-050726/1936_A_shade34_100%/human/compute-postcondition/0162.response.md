Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 3, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, ensuring that any buffered output is flushed to the console, but no variables have been modified.**
