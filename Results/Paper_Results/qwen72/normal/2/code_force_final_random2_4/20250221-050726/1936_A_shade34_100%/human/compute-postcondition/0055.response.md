Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**:
   - `mak` is 0.
   - Therefore, `pans[mak]` is the first element of the list `pans`.

2. **`pans[mak]` (second occurrence)**:
   - Since `mak` is still 0, this is also the first element of the list `pans`.

3. **`pans[i]`**:
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `pans[i]` is the element at index `n-1` of the list `pans`.

4. **`pans[i]` (second occurrence)**:
   - Since `i` is still `n-1`, this is also the element at index `n-1` of the list `pans`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- A question mark (`?`).
- The first element of the list `pans` twice.
- The last element of the list `pans` twice.

Given that `pans` must have at least 2 elements, we can denote the first element as `pans[0]` and the last element as `pans[n-1]`.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the list pans and pans[n-1] is the last element of the list pans)**
