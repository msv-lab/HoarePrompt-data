Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**:
   - `mak` is 0.
   - Therefore, `pans[mak]` is the first element of the list `pans`.

2. **`pans[mak]` (second occurrence)**:
   - This is the same as the first occurrence, so it is also the first element of the list `pans`.

3. **`pans[i]`**:
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `pans[i]` is the element at index `n-1` of the list `pans`.

4. **`pans[i]` (second occurrence)**:
   - This is the same as the first occurrence, so it is also the element at index `n-1` of the list `pans`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- The string `'?'`.
- The first element of the list `pans` twice.
- The element at index `n-1` of the list `pans` twice.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the list `pans` and [pans[n-1]] is the element at index n-1 of the list `pans`)**
