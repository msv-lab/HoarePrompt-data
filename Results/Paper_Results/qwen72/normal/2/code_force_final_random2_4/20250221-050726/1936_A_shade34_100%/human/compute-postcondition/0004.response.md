Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
- `mak` is 0
- `i` is 1

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:
- The first element is the string `'?'`.
- The second and third elements are both the value of `mak`, which is 0.
- The fourth and fifth elements are both the value of `i`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
