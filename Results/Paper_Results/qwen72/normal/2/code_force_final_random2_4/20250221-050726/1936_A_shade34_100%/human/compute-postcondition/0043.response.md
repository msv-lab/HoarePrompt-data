The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if `s` is `<`, otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `pans` is `[1]`.**
