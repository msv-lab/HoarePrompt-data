Output State: **_ is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**

### Explanation:
- **_**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **n**: Remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- **i**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `len(pans) - 1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.
- **mak**: This variable tracks the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`. If no such input was provided, `mak` will remain 0.
- **mak2**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **pans**: This list contains all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`. The length of `pans` determines the number of iterations the loop will run.
