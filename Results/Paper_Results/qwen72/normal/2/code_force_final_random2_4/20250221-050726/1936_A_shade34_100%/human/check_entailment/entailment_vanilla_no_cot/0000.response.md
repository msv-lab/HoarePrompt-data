Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The program starts by finding an index `mak` such that `p_mak` is the maximum element in the permutation. This is done by comparing each element with the current maximum using the query `? mak mak i i`. If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

3. **Finding Potential Pairs**:
   - After identifying `mak`, the program tries to find another index `mak2` that could potentially maximize the XOR value with `mak`. It does this by comparing each element with `mak` using the query `? mak mak2 i mak2`. If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and resets `pans` to `[i]`. If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`.

4. **Maximizing the XOR Value**:
   - From the list of potential pairs `pans`, the program finds the index that maximizes the XOR value with `mak2`. This is done by comparing each pair using the query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]`. If the result is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, the program outputs the pair `(mak2, pans[mak])` as the indices that maximize the XOR value.

The program adheres to the constraints and uses the allowed number of queries (at most 3n). Therefore, the program is correct.
