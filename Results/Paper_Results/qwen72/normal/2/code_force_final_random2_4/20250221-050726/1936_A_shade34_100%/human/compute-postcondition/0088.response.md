Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored).
- `n` must be greater than 3 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored).
- `i` is 3.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<` (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored).
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<` (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored).
- If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is updated to 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
- `mak` is initially 0, and it will only be updated to 2 if the user input is `<`. Since the initial state does not specify any user input, we assume `mak` remains 0.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.

### Output:
The print statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.

Output: **? 0 0 3 3**
