Output State: **_ is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the same as `mak`.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Since `mak` retains its value from the initial state, `mak2` also holds the same value. All other variables (`_`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
