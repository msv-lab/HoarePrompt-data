Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, which remains true after the code is executed.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `p`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
