The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop's continuation depends on whether `_` is within the range defined by `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.**
