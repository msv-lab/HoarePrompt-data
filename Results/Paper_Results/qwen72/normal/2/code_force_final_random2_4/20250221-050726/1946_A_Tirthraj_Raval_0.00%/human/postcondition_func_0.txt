The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it sorts the list `a`, finds the median element (or the middle element if `n` is odd), and prints the count of how many times this median element appears in the list. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the count for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
