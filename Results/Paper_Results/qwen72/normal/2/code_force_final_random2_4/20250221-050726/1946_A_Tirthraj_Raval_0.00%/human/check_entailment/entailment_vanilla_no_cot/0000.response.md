Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution is incorrect because it counts the occurrences of the current median instead of calculating the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the smallest value greater than the current median and calculate how many operations are needed to make the current median equal to this next value. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[p]
        next_value = current_median + 1
        while next_value not in a:
            next_value += 1
        operations = 0
        for i in range(p, n):
            if a[i] < next_value:
                operations += next_value - a[i]
            else:
                break
        print(operations)
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median by finding the next value greater than the current median and then determining the number of operations needed to make the current median reach this next value.
