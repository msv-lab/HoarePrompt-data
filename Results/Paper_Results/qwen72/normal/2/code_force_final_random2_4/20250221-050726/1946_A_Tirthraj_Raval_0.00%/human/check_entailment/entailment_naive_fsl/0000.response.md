Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in how the program calculates the result. Specifically, the line `res = a.count(a[p])` is incorrect. This line counts the occurrences of the current median in the array, which does not correspond to the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3
2 2 8
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output from the provided program:
```
2
```

The program incorrectly outputs `2` because it counts the occurrences of the current median (`2`) in the array, which is `2`. However, the correct answer is `1`, as increasing the first element by 1 results in the array `[3, 2, 8]`, and the new median is `3`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
