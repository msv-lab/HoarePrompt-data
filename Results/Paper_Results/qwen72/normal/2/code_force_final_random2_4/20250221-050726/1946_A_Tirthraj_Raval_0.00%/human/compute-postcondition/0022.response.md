Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `res = a.count(a[p])` calculates the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.
- The value of `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, which determines the index in the list `a`.
- The variable `res` is updated to the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
