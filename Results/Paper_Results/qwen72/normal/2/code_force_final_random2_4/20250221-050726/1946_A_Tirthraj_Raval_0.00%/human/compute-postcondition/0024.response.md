Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This remains the same as the initial input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- **`_`**: After all iterations, `_` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`.
- **`n`**: For each iteration, `n` is a new input integer representing the length of the array `a`.
- **`a`**: For each iteration, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- **`p`**: For each iteration, `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, which is the index of the middle element in the sorted list `a`.
- **`res`**: For each iteration, `res` is the count of how many times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
