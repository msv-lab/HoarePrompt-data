Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the initial condition. If `k >= a[l] * 2`, `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is reduced by `a[l-1] * 2`, `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l-1]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4` depending on the initial value of `r`. If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k < a[l] * 2`, and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l` equals `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
