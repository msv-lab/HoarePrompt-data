You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

At this point, `sunks` will be the total number of successful operations performed (either by decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in `a`). The values of `l` and `r` will reflect the indices that were processed during the loop, with `l` potentially being greater than `r` if the loop terminated due to `l` exceeding `r`. The value of `k` will be the remaining amount after all possible operations, which could be 0 if all operations were successful. The array `a` will be modified based on the operations performed, with some elements possibly reduced to 0 or removed from consideration by adjusting `l` and `r`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of successful operations (`sunks`) performed, which involves decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in the array `a`. The exact value of `sunks` depends on the initial values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and the elements in `a`, but it represents the count of times the operation was successfully applied before the loop terminated.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the attacks from the Kraken. Specifically, the program does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships, especially when the number of attacks `k` is large. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alternating Attacks**: The program attempts to handle the alternating attacks by checking conditions like `if a[l] <= a[r]` and `if a[r] < a[l]`. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the Kraken's behavior of attacking the first and last ships alternately until they sink or until the number of attacks is exhausted.

2. **Edge Case Failure**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   4 5
   1 2 4 3
   Expected Output:
   2
   Actual Output:
   1
   ```
   In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the number of sunk ships. The expected behavior is:
   - Attack the first ship: `[0, 2, 4, 3]` (ship 1 sinks)
   - Attack the last ship: `[2, 4, 2]`
   - Attack the first ship: `[1, 4, 2]`
   - Attack the last ship: `[1, 4, 1]`
   - Attack the first ship: `[0, 4, 1]` (ship 1 sinks)

   The program fails to correctly simulate this sequence, leading to an incorrect count of sunk ships.

To fix this, the program should correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks by alternating between the first and last ships and updating their durabilities accordingly. The program should also handle the case where a ship's durability reaches zero and it is removed from the list of active ships.
