You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the length of the list `a`), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of positive integers). It returns the total number of successful operations (`sunks`) performed. Each operation involves decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in the array `a`. The function processes the elements of `a` from both ends (using indices `l` and `r`), performing operations until either `k` reaches 0 or the indices `l` and `r` cross each other. The final state of the program includes the updated value of `k` (which could be 0 if all operations were successful), the modified array `a` (with some elements possibly reduced to 0), and the total count of successful operations (`sunks`).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of each ship `a`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. It takes three parameters: `n` (number of ships), `k` (number of attacks), and `a` (list of ship durabilities).

3. **Initialization**: The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the first and last ship indices, respectively, and a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

4. **Main Loop**: The main loop runs as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. This ensures that there are still ships left to be attacked.

5. **Single Ship Case**: If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. The program checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink this ship. If so, it increments the `sunks` counter and breaks the loop.

6. **Multiple Ships Case**:
   - If the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`) is less than or equal to the durability of the last ship (`a[r]`), the program checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink both the first and last ships. If so, it updates the durabilities and counters accordingly.
   - If the durability of the last ship (`a[r]`) is less than the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`), the program performs similar checks but in reverse order.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `k` is exactly enough to sink a ship or where `k` is not enough to sink any more ships.
   - It also handles cases where all ships are sunk before the total number of attacks `k` is exhausted.

8. **Output**: The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for simulating the Kraken's attacks on the ships and counting the number of sunk ships. The logic is sound and handles various edge cases appropriately.
