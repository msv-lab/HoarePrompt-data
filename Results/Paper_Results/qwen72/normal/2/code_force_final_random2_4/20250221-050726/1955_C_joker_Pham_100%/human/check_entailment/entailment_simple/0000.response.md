### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the durability of each ship in the list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate arguments `n`, `k`, and `a`.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively. It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.
   - **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`, meaning there are still ships to be attacked.
   - **Termination Conditions**:
     - If `k` reaches 0, the loop breaks because no more attacks can be made.
     - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. The function checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink this ship. If so, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
   - **Attack Logic**:
     - The function checks if the durability of the leftmost ship `a[l]` is less than or equal to the rightmost ship `a[r]`. If so, it calculates the number of attacks needed to reduce `a[l]` to 0 and updates `k` and `a[r]` accordingly. It then increments `sunks` and adjusts the pointers `l` and `r`.
     - If the durability of the rightmost ship `a[r]` is less than the leftmost ship `a[l]`, it performs similar calculations and updates for the rightmost ship.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The function handles cases where `k` is exactly enough to sink a ship or just one less than enough to sink a ship.

4. **Output**: The function returns the total number of ships that have sunk, which is stored in `sunks`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as expected, and the loop and conditional statements are designed to simulate the Kraken's attacks accurately.

Correctness: **True**
