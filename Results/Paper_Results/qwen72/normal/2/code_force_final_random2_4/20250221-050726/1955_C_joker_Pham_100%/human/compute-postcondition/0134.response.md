The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`.
- `k` is a positive integer representing an initial value.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.

The function returns the total number of successful operations (`sunks`) performed. Each operation involves decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in the array `a`. The exact value of `sunks` depends on the initial values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and the elements in `a`, but it represents the count of times the operation was successfully applied before the loop terminated.
