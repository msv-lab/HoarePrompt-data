Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` - 2 * `a[l]` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition, `sunks` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`. If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
