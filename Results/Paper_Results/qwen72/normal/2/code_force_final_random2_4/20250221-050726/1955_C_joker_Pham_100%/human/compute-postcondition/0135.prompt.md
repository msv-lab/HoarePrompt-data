You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and a is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
                break
            break
        
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            if k >= a[l] * 2:
                k -= a[l] * 2
                a[r] -= a[l]
                if a[r] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    r -= 1
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
                continue
            elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
                sunks += 1
                break
            else:
                break
        
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if a[r] < a[l]:
            if k >= a[r] * 2:
                k -= a[r] * 2
                a[l] -= a[r]
                if a[l] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    l += 1
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
                continue
            elif a[r] * 2 == k:
                sunks += 1
                break
            else:
                break
        
    #State: The loop will terminate when `l > r` or `k == 0`. At this point, `sunks` will be the total number of successful operations performed (either by decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in `a`). The values of `l` and `r` will reflect the indices that were processed during the loop, with `l` potentially being greater than `r` if the loop terminated due to `l` exceeding `r`. The value of `k` will be the remaining amount after all possible operations, which could be 0 if all operations were successful. The array `a` will be modified based on the operations performed, with some elements possibly reduced to 0 or removed from consideration by adjusting `l` and `r`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of successful operations (`sunks`) performed, which involves decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in the array `a`. The exact value of `sunks` depends on the initial values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and the elements in `a`, but it represents the count of times the operation was successfully applied before the loop terminated.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. It returns the total number of successful operations (`sunks`) performed, where each operation decrements `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updates the corresponding elements in the array `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of successful operations (`sunks`) performed, which involves decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in the array `a`. The exact value of `sunks` depends on the initial values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and the elements in `a`, but it represents the count of times the operation was successfully applied before the loop terminated.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
