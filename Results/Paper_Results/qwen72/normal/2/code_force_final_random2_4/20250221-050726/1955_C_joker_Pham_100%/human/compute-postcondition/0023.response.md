The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables during this iteration, and the program simply proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition, `sunks` is 2, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` (if applicable), `k` is `k - 2 * a[l-1]`, and `a[r]` is 0 if `a[r]` was initially greater than or equal to `a[l-1]`.**
