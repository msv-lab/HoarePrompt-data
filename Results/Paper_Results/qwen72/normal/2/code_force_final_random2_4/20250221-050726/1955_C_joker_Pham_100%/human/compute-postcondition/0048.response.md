Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition. `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `k` is 0, the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `a[r]` is less than the value of `a[l]`. Additionally, `k` is equal to `a[r] * 2`, and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` which implies `k` is exactly `a[r] * 2`.**
