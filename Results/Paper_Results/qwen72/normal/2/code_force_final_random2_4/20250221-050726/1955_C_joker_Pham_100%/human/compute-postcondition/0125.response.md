Output State: **`sunks` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4` depending on the initial condition, `k` is updated to `k - a[r+1] * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r+1]`. If `a[l]` is 0, `sunks` is set to 1. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
