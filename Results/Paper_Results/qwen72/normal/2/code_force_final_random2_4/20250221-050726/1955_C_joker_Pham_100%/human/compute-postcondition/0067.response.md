The value of `r` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Since `r` was initially either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, after decrementing, `r` will be either `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` - 2 * `a[l]` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is now `r - 1` (which means `r` is either `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`), `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`. If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
