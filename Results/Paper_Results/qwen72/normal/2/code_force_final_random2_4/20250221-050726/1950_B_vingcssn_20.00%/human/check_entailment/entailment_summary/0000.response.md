Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the specific cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \) by printing the appropriate checkerboard patterns. However, the problem description specifies that \( n \) can be any integer between 1 and 20, inclusive. The program fails to handle cases where \( n > 4 \), instead printing "No esta en el rango" for such values. This is incorrect because the program should generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid \( n \) within the specified range.

Additionally, the program does not follow the requirement to handle up to 20 test cases efficiently. It should generate the checkerboard pattern dynamically for any \( n \) within the range, rather than hardcoding specific cases.

Correctness: **False**
