Postcondition: ***`c` is 0, `casos` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 1. If `n` is 2, the current value of `n` is 2. If `n` is not 2, `n` is not equal to 1, and if `n` is 3, the current value of `n` is 3. If `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.***
