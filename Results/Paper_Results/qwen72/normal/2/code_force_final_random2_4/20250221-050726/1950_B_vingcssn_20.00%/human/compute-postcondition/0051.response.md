The given Python code snippet is:
```python
print('##..##..')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides information about the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints a fixed string `'##..##..'`.

### Explanation:
- The string `'##..##..'` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.
- Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will always be the same, regardless of the values of `c`, `casos`, or `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **##..##..**
