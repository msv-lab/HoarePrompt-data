Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to 1.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- The current value of `n` is 3.

The print statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('##..##')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'##..##'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, it will print the string as it is.

Output: **##..##**
