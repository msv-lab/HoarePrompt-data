Reasoning:

The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Range Handling**: The program only handles specific values of `n` (1, 2, 3, 4) explicitly. However, the problem description specifies that `n` can be any integer between 1 and 20. The program will fail for any `n` outside the range of 1 to 4, printing "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern.

2. **Pattern Generation**: The program uses hardcoded strings for the checkerboard patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`. This approach is not scalable and does not generalize to other values of `n`. The problem requires a dynamic solution that can generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid `n`.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the general case of generating the checkerboard pattern dynamically, which is essential for the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
