Output State: **`c` is `casos - 1`, `casos` is the number of test cases provided by the user, and `n` is the last input integer provided by the user. If the last input `n` is 1, the current value of `n` is 1. If the last input `n` is 2, the current value of `n` is 2. If the last input `n` is 3, the current value of `n` is 3. If the last input `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4. If the last input `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, the value of `n` remains unchanged.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `c` will be one less than the total number of test cases (`casos - 1`), and the value of `n` will be the last input integer provided by the user. The value of `casos` remains unchanged as it was initially set by the user.
