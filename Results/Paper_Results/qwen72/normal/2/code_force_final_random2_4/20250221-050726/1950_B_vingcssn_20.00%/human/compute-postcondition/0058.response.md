To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `c` is 1.
- `casos` is greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer with specific conditions:
  - If `n` is 1, the current value of `n` is 1.
  - If `n` is 2, the current value of `n` is 2.
  - If `n` is 3, the current value of `n` is 3.
  - If `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4.
  - Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('No esta en el rango')
```

This statement will only execute if `n` does not meet any of the specified conditions (i.e., `n` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4). Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No esta en el rango** (where `n` is an integer not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4)
