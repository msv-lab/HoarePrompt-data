#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, which determines the size of the checkerboard to be generated. The function should read the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) from the input, followed by `t` lines, each containing a single integer `n`.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: `c` is `casos - 1`, `casos` is the number of test cases provided by the user, and `n` is the last input integer provided by the user. If the last input `n` is 1, the current value of `n` is 1. If the last input `n` is 2, the current value of `n` is 2. If the last input `n` is 3, the current value of `n` is 3. If the last input `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4. If the last input `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, the value of `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 4). For each test case, it prints a checkerboard pattern of size `n x n` using `#` and `.` characters. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program is that all specified checkerboard patterns have been printed to the console.
