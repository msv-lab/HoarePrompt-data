The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `casos`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `c` and `casos`. If `c` is less than `casos`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0 and `casos` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `c` becomes 1), and `casos` must still be greater than `c`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`c` is 1, `casos` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the current value of `n` is 1. If `n` is 2, the current value of `n` is 2. If `n` is 3, the current value of `n` is 3. If `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.**
