The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the new value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine if it is 1, 2, 3, 4, or another integer. However, the conditions for `n` being 1, 2, 3, or 4 still apply based on the new input.

Output State: **`c` is 1, `casos` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the current value of `n` is 1. If `n` is 2, the current value of `n` is 2. If `n` is 3, the current value of `n` is 3. If `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.**
