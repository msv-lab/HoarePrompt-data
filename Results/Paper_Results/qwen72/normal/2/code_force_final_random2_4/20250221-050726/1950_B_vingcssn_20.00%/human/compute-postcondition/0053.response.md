The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string: `'..##..##'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement does not depend on the values of these variables.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement will always be the same, regardless of the values of `c`, `casos`, or `n`.

Output: **..##..##**
