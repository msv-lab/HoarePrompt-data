The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts a set of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers. Specifically, `t` represents the number of test cases, each `n` represents the length of the corresponding array `a`, and each array `a` contains integers within the specified range.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- The array `a` consists of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns some result based on the input arrays. Since the specific output is not detailed in the problem statement, I will assume the function returns a result for each test case, which could be a processed form of the array or a derived value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
