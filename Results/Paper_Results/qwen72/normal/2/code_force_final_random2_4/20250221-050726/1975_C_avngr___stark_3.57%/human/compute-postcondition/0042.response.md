To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `t` is `t - 2`
  - `n` is greater than 1
  - `a` is a new list of integers input by the user
  - `i` is 1
  - If the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is greater than the initial `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop condition is `i < n`.

### Adjusting the State:
- **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- **`n`**: The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains `t - 2` (unchanged from the previous iteration).
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
- `a` remains the same list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is now 2.
- `max` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (either updated or unchanged based on the previous comparison).

### Final State:
State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `max` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**
