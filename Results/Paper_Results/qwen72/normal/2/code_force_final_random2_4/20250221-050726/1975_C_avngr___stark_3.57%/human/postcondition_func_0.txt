The function `func` reads a series of test cases from the input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function finds the maximum value among the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the array `a`. The function prints this maximum value for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. The final state of the program includes the processed test cases, with the last processed values of `n`, `a`, and the maximum value found for the last test case.
