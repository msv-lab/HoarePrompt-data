The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 each time).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `max`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `max` is the maximum value among the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.**
