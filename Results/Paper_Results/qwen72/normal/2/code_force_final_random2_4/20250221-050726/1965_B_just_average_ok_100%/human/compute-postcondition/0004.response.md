The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `idx` is -1, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly. For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least one element, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is -1, `i` is 0**
