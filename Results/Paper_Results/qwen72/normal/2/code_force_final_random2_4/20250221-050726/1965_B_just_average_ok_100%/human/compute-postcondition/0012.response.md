Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If `nums[1]` > `k`, then `idx` is set to 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1.***
