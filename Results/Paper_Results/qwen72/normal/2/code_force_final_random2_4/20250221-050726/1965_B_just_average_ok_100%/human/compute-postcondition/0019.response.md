The code snippet `nums.append(k + 1)` adds the value `k + 1` to the end of the list `nums`. Let's analyze the impact on the program:

- `_` remains a placeholder.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `k` remains a positive integer.
- `nums` originally contains integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended. After the code execution, `k + 1` is appended to the end of `nums`.
- `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists. Since `k + 1` is added to the end of `nums`, `i` might change if `k + 1` is greater than `k` and there was no element in `nums` greater than `k` before.
- `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1. If `i` changes due to the addition of `k + 1`, `idx` will also be updated accordingly.

Given that `k + 1` is added to the end of `nums`, the new length of `nums` is `len(nums) + 1`. If `k + 1` is greater than `k` and there was no element in `nums` greater than `k` before, `i` will now be `len(nums) - 1` (the index of the newly added element), and `idx` will be `i - 1`.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1` appended, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists, `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.**
