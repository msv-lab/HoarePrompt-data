Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `n` and `k` are input positive integers.
- `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
- `k - nums[idx]` is appended to the end of `nums`.
- `k + 1` is appended to the end of `nums`.
- `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to the end of `nums`.
- The value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from the list.
- `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`.
- `idx` is `i - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `nums` Construction:**
   - Initially, `nums` contains the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\):
     \[
     \text{nums} = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]
     \]

2. **Appending Values:**
   - `k - nums[idx]` is appended to the end of `nums`.
   - `k + 1` is appended to the end of `nums`.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to the end of `nums`.

3. **Removing Value:**
   - The value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from the list.

4. **Index Calculation:**
   - `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`.
   - `idx` is `i - 1`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `k = 10` for simplicity:
- `nums` initially: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`
- `k - nums[idx]` where `idx` is determined later.
- `k + 1` is 11.
- `k + nums[idx] + 1` where `idx` is determined later.

### Determining `idx`:
- `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`, which is 11.
- `idx` is `i - 1`, which is 10.

### Appending and Removing:
- `k - nums[idx]` is `10 - 1024 = -1014`.
- `k + 1` is 11.
- `k + nums[idx] + 1` is `10 + 1024 + 1 = 1035`.
- Remove \(2^{10} = 1024\) from the list.

### Final `nums` List:
- Initial list: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`
- After appending and removing: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, -1014, 11, 1035]`

### Print Statement:
```
print(*nums)
```

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the elements of the `nums` list separated by spaces.
Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 -1014 11 1035**
