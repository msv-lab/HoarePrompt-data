The code `nums.remove(1 << idx)` removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `nums` initially contains integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), followed by `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`.
- `idx` is `i - 1`.

The value `1 << idx` is equivalent to \(2^{\text{idx}}\). Since `idx` is `i - 1`, and `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`, `1 << idx` corresponds to the value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) in the list `nums`.

After removing `1 << idx` from `nums`, the list `nums` will no longer contain the value \(2^{\text{idx}}\).

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with the value `k - nums[idx]` appended at the end, followed by `k + 1`, and now `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended at the end, but without the value \(2^{\text{idx}}\), `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`, `idx` is `i - 1`.**
