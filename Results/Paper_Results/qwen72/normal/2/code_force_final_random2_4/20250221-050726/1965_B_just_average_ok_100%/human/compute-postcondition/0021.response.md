Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1` appended, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1` at the end, but without the element `1 << idx`. `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists, `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums.remove(1 << idx)` removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`.
- The value of `1 << idx` is a power of 2, specifically \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
- The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), plus the elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- After removing `1 << idx`, the list `nums` no longer contains this specific power of 2.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` and `idx` remain the same because they are determined based on the position of elements in `nums` relative to `k`, and the removal of `1 << idx` does not affect these positions unless `1 << idx` was the element at index `i` or `idx`. However, since `i` and `idx` are defined based on the first element greater than `k` or the length of `nums`, their values remain valid.
