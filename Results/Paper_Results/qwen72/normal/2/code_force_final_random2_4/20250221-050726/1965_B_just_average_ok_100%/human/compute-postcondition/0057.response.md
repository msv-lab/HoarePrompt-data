The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `idx` is -1, and the list `nums` contains integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and the length of `nums` remains the same.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 1, `idx` is -1, and the number of iterations remaining is one less than before.**
