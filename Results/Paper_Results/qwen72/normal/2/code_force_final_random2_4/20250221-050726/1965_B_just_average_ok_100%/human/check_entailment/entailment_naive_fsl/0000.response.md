Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program constructs a sequence `nums` that includes powers of 2, and then modifies this sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`. However, the way it constructs and modifies the sequence can lead to issues:

1. **Handling of `k` and `k+1`**: The program appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the sequence. This approach may not always ensure that there is no subsequence summing to `k`, especially when `k` is close to the largest power of 2 in the sequence.

2. **Removing `1 << idx`**: The program removes `1 << idx` from the sequence, which might not always result in a valid sequence that meets the problem's requirements.

3. **Sequence Size**: The program does not guarantee that the sequence will have at most 25 elements, as required by the problem statement. The sequence can potentially grow larger than 25 elements due to the way it is constructed and modified.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
10 7
```
The program constructs the sequence as follows:
- Initial sequence: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]`
- Finds the index where `1 << i > 7`, which is `i = 3` (since `8 > 7`).
- Removes `1 << 3` (which is `8`), and appends `7 - 4`, `7 + 1`, and `7 + 4 + 1` to the sequence.
- Final sequence: `[1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 3, 8, 12]`

This sequence has more than 25 elements, which violates the problem's requirement that the sequence should have at most 25 elements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
