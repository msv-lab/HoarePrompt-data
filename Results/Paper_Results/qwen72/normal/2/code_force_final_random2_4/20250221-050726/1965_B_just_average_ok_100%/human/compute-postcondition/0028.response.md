To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not relevant to the loop).
- `n` is an input positive integer (not relevant to the loop).
- `k` is an input positive integer (not relevant to the loop).
- `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
- `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists.
- `idx` is -1 (not relevant to the loop).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the `nums` list.
- The loop will execute if `len(nums)` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is used as the loop index, starting from 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be greater than 0.
- The initial value of `i` should be 0.

### Final State:
- `i` must be 0.
- `len(nums)` must be greater than 0.

### State:
**`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 0, `idx` is -1, `len(nums)` must be greater than 0**
