The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as input. It then constructs a list `nums` initially containing powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). The function modifies this list by adding three specific elements (`k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`) and removing one element (`1 << idx`). Finally, it prints the length of the modified list followed by the elements of the list. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to print the results for each test case.
