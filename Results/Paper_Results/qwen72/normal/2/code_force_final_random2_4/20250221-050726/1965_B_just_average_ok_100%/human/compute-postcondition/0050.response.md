Initial State: `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with the value `k - nums[idx]` appended at the end, followed by `k + 1`, and now `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended at the end, but without the value \(2^{\text{idx}}\), `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`, `idx` is `i - 1`, the number of iterations remaining is one less than before.

Code:
```python
nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. The list comprehension `[(1 << i) for i in range(21)]` generates a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
2. This list replaces the current value of `nums`.

The initial state specifies that `nums` already contains a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), plus additional elements. However, the code overwrites `nums` with a new list of just the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).

Therefore, the output state is:
- `nums` is now a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
- The additional elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are no longer in `nums`.
- The index `i` of `k + 1` in `nums` is no longer valid because `k + 1` is not in the new `nums`.
- The value of `idx` which was `i - 1` is also no longer valid.
- The number of iterations remaining is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is undefined, `idx` is undefined, the number of iterations remaining is one less than before.**
