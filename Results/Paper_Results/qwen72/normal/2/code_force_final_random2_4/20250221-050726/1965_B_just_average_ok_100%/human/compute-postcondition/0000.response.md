To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `_`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a placeholder used in the loop. The actual control of the loop is determined by the result of `int(input())`.
2. **Input Requirement**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. This means the input must be a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0.
3. **Initial State**: The initial state provided includes `t` being an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. However, these details are not directly relevant to the loop head.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must return a positive integer (greater than 0)**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
