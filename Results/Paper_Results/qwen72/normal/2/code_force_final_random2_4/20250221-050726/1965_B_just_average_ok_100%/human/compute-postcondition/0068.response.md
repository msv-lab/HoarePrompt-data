Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, followed by `k + 1`, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`, `i` is 21, and `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. If no such power of 2 exists, `idx` remains -1.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`.
- The initial state specifies that `nums` already contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), plus an additional element `k - nums[idx]`, followed by `k + 1`.
- After appending `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the list `nums` now includes this new element.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `idx`) remain unchanged.
