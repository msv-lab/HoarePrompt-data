To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(nums))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the `nums` list:

1. **Initial State of `nums`:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
   - This means `nums` initially contains the following elements: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 1048576]`.

2. **Modifications to `nums`:**
   - An additional element `k - nums[idx]` is appended to `nums`.
   - Another element `k + 1` is appended to `nums`.
   - Yet another element `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to `nums`.
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is \(2^{\text{idx}}\)) is removed from `nums`.

3. **Determine `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If no such power of 2 exists, `idx` remains -1.

4. **Calculate the length of `nums` after modifications:**
   - Initially, `nums` has 21 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
   - Three new elements are added: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - One element is removed: \(2^{\text{idx}}\).

   Therefore, the net change in the length of `nums` is:
   \[
   \text{Initial length} + 3 - 1 = 21 + 3 - 1 = 23
   \]

So, the final length of `nums` is 23.

Output: **23**
