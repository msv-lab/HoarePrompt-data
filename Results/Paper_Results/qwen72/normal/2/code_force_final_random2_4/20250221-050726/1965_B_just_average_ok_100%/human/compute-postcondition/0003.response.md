Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `idx` is -1.**

The code initializes the variable `idx` to -1. This does not affect the other variables, so their initial states remain unchanged. The variable `idx` is now set to -1.
