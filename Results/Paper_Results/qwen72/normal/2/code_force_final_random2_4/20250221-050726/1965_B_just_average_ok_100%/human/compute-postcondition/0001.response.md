The code snippet takes an input from the user, which is expected to be two integers separated by a space. These integers are then split and converted into integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second to `k`. Since `int(input())` must return a positive integer, and the input is now being split into two parts, both `n` and `k` are expected to be positive integers.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer**
