Postcondition: ***`t` is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd; `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer (converted from its original string value); `b` is an integer (converted from its original string value). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t1` retains its value as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is updated based on the divisibility of `t2` by 15. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. In both cases, `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is recalculated as `a - t1`.***
