### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` for each case.

2. **Initial Calculation of `t`**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to the number of 2x2 icons (`b`).
   - If `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2`.
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is set to `b // 2 + 1`.
   - This calculation ensures that `t` represents the minimum number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons, considering that each screen can hold up to 3 such icons (since 15 cells / 4 cells per icon = 3.75, rounded down to 3).

3. **Calculation of Remaining Space**:
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there is enough space to fit all 1x1 icons, so `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, it means additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.

4. **Adjustment for Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, representing the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
   - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`.
   - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1` to account for the partial screen needed.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the final value of `t` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to fit all the icons based on the given constraints and input. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
