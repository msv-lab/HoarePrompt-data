Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `t` will hold the final computed value for each iteration, which is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `t` starts as `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. If `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains the same. Otherwise, `t` is adjusted based on the difference `t2` (calculated as `a - t1`). If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`. The variables `a` and `b` are updated with each iteration to the next pair of integers read from the input. The loop will have processed `n` pairs of integers (`a`, `b`), and the final state of `t` will reflect the last computation performed in the loop.**

This means that after the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `t` will contain the final result of the computation for the last pair of inputs (`a`, `b`). The values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and the loop will have processed all `n` pairs of integers as specified.
