The value of `t` is updated to `t // 2 + 1`. Since `t` was initially equal to `b`, the new value of `t` is `(b // 2) + 1`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `t` is `(b // 2) + 1`.**
