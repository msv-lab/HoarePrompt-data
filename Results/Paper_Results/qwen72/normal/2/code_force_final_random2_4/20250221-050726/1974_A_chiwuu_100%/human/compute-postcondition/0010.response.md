Postcondition: ***`t` is equal to `b`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (converted from its original string value). If `t` is even, `t` is now `b // 2`. If `t` is odd, `t` is now `(b // 2) + 1`.***
