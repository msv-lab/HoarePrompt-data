Output State: **`a` and `b` are now integers converted from their original string values, while the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, converting them to integers.
- The values of `a` and `b` are now integers, but the specific values depend on the input provided.
- The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial state, as no operations have been performed on them yet.
