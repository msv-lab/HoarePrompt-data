Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Initially, `sum_f` was 0, so after executing the code, `sum_f` becomes `f`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` remain as they were in the initial state.
