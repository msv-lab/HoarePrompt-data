Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `j` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * (f + f) + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by `f`. Initially, `sum_f` was `0 + f`, which simplifies to `f`. After the increment, `sum_f` becomes `f + f`. All other variables remain unchanged, so their initial states are still valid. The expressions for `p` and `q` are updated to reflect the new value of `sum_f`.
