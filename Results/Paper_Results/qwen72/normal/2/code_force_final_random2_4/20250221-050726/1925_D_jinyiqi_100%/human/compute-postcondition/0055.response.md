Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` must be greater than 2:** This condition remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state.
- **`i` is 2:** This value remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` is an input integer:** This value remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m` is an input integer:** This value remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k` is an input integer:** This value remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop:** The variable `sum_f` accumulates the sum of all `f` values provided as input during each iteration of the loop.
- **`j` is `m - 1`:** After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `m - 1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `m - 1`.
- **`a` is an input integer:** This value is updated with each iteration but is not retained after the loop.
- **`b` is an input integer:** This value is updated with each iteration but is not retained after the loop.
- **`f` is an input integer:** This value is updated with each iteration but is not retained after the loop.
- **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`:** This value remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`:** This value is calculated based on the final value of `sum_f` and the other constants.
- **`q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`:** This value remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`:** This value is calculated based on the final values of `p` and `q`.
