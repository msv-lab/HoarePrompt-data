The code snippet `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f` after converting them to integers.

- `a`, `b`, and `f` are now assigned the integer values provided by the user.
- The initial state variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `sum_f`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `sum_f` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers provided by the user.**
