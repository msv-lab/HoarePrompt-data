The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**
