Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations, `j` is `m - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with the values provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `sum_f`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` remain unchanged from their initial state.
