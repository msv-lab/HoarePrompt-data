You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, `j` is `m - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of nodes (`n`), the number of edges (`m`), and the number of queries (`k`). For each test case, it reads a list of edges, where each edge is represented by two nodes (`a_i`, `b_i`) and a value (`f_i`). It calculates a result based on these inputs and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case, and the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` are updated accordingly for each iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the formula used in the program to calculate `p` and `q` is incorrect. The program calculates `p` and `q` as follows:

```python
p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
```

However, the correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values should be:

\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

Where:
- \( f_i \) is the initial friendship value of the i-th pair.
- \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of n, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

The expected value for each pair is the initial friendship value plus the expected increase in friendship value over k excursions. The expected increase in friendship value for each pair is \( \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) because each pair has a probability of \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) of being chosen in each excursion, and this happens k times.

The program's formula does not correctly reflect this expected value calculation, leading to incorrect results for many test cases. For example, consider the following test case:

```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```

The correct output should be 3, but the program will produce a different result due to the incorrect formula. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
