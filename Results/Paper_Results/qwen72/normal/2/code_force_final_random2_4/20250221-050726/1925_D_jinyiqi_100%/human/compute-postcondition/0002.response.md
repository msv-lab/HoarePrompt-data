To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

- `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.
- `t` is the number of test cases, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, and it must be positive for the loop to run.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
