Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions, given the constraints and the nature of the problem. Let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, the number of friend pairs, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Calculation of Total Friendship Value**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs (`sum_f`).

3. **Combination Calculation**:
   - It calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` (`cn2`), which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplification**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction `p/q` by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).

6. **Modular Inverse and Result**:
   - The program computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then multiplies `p` by the modular inverse of `q` and takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input as specified.
- **Sum of Friendship Values**: The sum of initial friendship values is correctly calculated.
- **Combination Calculation**: The combination `cn2` is correctly calculated.
- **Expected Value Calculation**: The formula used for the expected value is derived from the problem statement and is correct.
- **Simplification and Modular Inverse**: The program correctly simplifies the fraction and computes the modular inverse.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
