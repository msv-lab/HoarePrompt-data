The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
