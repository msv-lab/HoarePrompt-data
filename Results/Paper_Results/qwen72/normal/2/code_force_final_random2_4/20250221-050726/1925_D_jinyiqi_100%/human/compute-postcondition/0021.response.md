To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user.
- `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations.
- `m` is the number of iterations completed.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers.
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `cn2`:**
   \[
   \text{cn2} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Calculate `p`:**
   \[
   p = \frac{2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{\text{gcd}}
   \]

3. **Calculate `q`:**
   \[
   q = \frac{2 \times \text{cn2}}{\text{gcd}}
   \]

4. **Calculate the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`:**
   \[
   \text{mod\_inv\_q} = \text{pow}(q, -1, M)
   \]

5. **Calculate the final result:**
   \[
   \text{result} = (p \times \text{mod\_inv\_q}) \% M
   \]

### Explanation of the Output:
- The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.
- The value of `p` and `q` are computed based on the given formulas and the greatest common divisor `gcd`.
- The modular inverse of `q` modulo `M` is computed using the `pow` function with the third argument as `M`.
- The final result is the product of `p` and the modular inverse of `q`, taken modulo `M`.

### Final Output:
Output: **(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) (where p is (2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd, q is (2 * cn2) // gcd, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, gcd is the greatest common divisor of p and q, and M is a predefined constant)**

This output provides a precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the computation steps.
