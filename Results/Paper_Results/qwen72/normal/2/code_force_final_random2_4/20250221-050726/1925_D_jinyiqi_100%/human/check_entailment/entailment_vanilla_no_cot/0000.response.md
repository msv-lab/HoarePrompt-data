Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of friend pairs `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values**: It calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: It computes the number of ways to choose 2 children from `n` children using the combination formula \( C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions. The formula used is derived from the problem statement and correctly accounts for the increase in friendship values over the excursions.

5. **Modular Inverse**: The program uses the modular inverse to compute the final result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is necessary for handling large numbers and ensuring the result fits within the required constraints.

6. **GCD and Simplification**: The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD) before computing the modular inverse.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
