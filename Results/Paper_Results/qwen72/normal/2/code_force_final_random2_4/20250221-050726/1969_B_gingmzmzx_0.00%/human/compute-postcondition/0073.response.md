Output State: **If `c` is 0: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0], `ans` is `zeroes - 3`. If `c` is 1: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 3], `ans` is `2 * zeroes - 1 + (zeroes - 0)`.**
