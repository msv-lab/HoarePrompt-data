To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`.
   - `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the number of ones before each zero in `s` plus the number of zeros after each one in `s`.

2. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - For each zero in `s`, count the number of ones that appear before it.
   - For each one in `s`, count the number of zeros that appear after it.
   - Sum these counts to get `ans`.

Given this information, let's consider the steps to compute `ans`:

- **Counting Ones Before Each Zero:**
  - Traverse the list `s` from left to right.
  - Maintain a running count of ones encountered so far.
  - For each zero, add the current count of ones to `ans`.

- **Counting Zeros After Each One:**
  - Traverse the list `s` from right to left.
  - Maintain a running count of zeros encountered so far.
  - For each one, add the current count of zeros to `ans`.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

Suppose `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`:
- Count of zeros (`zeroes`): 2
- Count of ones (`ones`): 3
- `cnt` will be `[2, 3]`

**Step-by-step calculation:**
- **Counting ones before each zero:**
  - First zero at index 1: 1 one before it.
  - Second zero at index 3: 2 ones before it.
  - Total: 1 + 2 = 3

- **Counting zeros after each one:**
  - First one at index 0: 2 zeros after it.
  - Second one at index 2: 1 zero after it.
  - Third one at index 4: 0 zeros after it.
  - Total: 2 + 1 + 0 = 3

- **Summing both counts:**
  - `ans = 3 (ones before zeros) + 3 (zeros after ones) = 6`

Therefore, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the number of ones before each zero in s plus the number of zeros after each one in s)**

In the specific example provided, the output would be:
Output: **6**
