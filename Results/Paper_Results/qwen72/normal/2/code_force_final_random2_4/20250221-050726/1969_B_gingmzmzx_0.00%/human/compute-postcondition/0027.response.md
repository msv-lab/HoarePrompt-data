The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts each character to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in `s`.

- `s` is updated to be a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [number of zeros in `s`, number of ones in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of ones before each zero in `s` plus the number of zeros after each one in `s`, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string.**
