Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. The logic implemented in the function is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
3. It counts the number of zeros in the string and initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
4. It iterates through each character in the string:
   - If the character is 0, it increments the count of 0s and adds 1 to `ans` if there have been any 1s encountered before.
   - If the character is 1, it increments the count of 1s and adds the number of remaining 0s (i.e., total 0s minus the 0s encountered so far) to `ans`.
5. Finally, it prints the calculated `ans` for each test case.

The logic correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering the cost of moving each 1 past the 0s that come after it in the string. This ensures that the string can be made sorted with the minimum number of cyclic shifts.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation: the variable `n` is used to read the number of test cases but is not used in the loop condition. Instead, the loop uses `_` which is a common practice in Python for unused variables. This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the algorithm.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **True**
