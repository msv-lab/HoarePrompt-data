Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [count of 0s in `s`, count of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each 1 in `s` plus the sum of 1 for each 0 in `s` when there is at least one 1 before it.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: The list of integers representing the digits of the binary string remains unchanged.
- **`n`**: Initially greater than 0, it is decremented by 1 for each iteration. After all iterations, `n` will be 0.
- **`zeroes`**: The count of zeros in the list `s` remains unchanged.
- **`cnt`**: This list keeps track of the counts of 0s and 1s in `s`. After the loop completes, `cnt[0]` will be the total number of 0s in `s`, and `cnt[1]` will be the total number of 1s in `s`.
- **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the result based on the conditions inside the loop. For each 0 in `s`, `ans` increases by 1 if there is at least one 1 before it. For each 1 in `s`, `ans` increases by the number of zeros minus the number of 0s encountered so far. Therefore, `ans` is the sum of these contributions for all elements in `s`.
