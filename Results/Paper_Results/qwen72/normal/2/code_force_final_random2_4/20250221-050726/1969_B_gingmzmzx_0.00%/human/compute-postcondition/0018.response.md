Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is the second element of the list `s`, and `cnt` is [2, 0] if the second element of `s` is 0 or [0, 2] if the second element of `s` is 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 0 if the first element of `s` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes` if the first element of `s` is 0 and the second element is 1, or `ans` is `zeroes + 1` if the first element of `s` is 1 and the second element is 1. If `c` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - 2)` if the second element of `s` is 0, or `ans + zeroes` if the second element of `s` is 1.***
