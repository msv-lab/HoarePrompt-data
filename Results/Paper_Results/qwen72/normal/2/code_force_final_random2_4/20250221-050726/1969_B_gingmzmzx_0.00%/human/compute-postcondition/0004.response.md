The code initializes a list `cnt` with two elements, both set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, or `zeroes`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0]**.
