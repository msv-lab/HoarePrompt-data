Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [number of zeros in `s`, number of ones in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of ones before each zero in `s` plus the number of zeros after each one in `s`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: The list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string. It remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the list itself.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`zeroes`**: The count of zeros in the list `s`. This value remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the list `s`.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt` will contain the counts of zeros and ones in the list `s`. Specifically, `cnt[0]` will be the number of zeros, and `cnt[1]` will be the number of ones.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of the number of ones before each zero in `s` and the number of zeros after each one in `s`. This is because:
  - For each zero (`c == 0`), `ans` is incremented by 1 if there are any ones before it (`cnt[1] > 0`).
  - For each one (`c == 1`), `ans` is incremented by the number of zeros that come after it (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).

Thus, the final value of `ans` represents the total count of such pairs in the list `s`.
