The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `cnt` is initially `[1, 0]` if the second element of `s` is 0, or `[0, 1]` if the second element of `s` is 1.
- `c` is the second element of the list `s`.

If `c` is 0:
- `cnt[0]` is initially 1, so `cnt[0]` becomes 2.
- `cnt[1]` remains 0.

If `c` is 1:
- `cnt[1]` is initially 1, so `cnt[1]` becomes 2.
- `cnt[0]` remains 0.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `ans` is 0 if the first element of `s` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes`, `c` is the second element of the list `s`, and `cnt` is [2, 0] if the second element of `s` is 0 or [0, 2] if the second element of `s` is 1.**
