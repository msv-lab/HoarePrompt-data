Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `arr`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `n` in the list `arr`.
- For each `n`, the loop updates the dictionary `freq` by incrementing the count of `n` by 1.
- After the loop completes, `freq` will contain each unique integer from `arr` as a key, and the corresponding value will be the number of times that integer appears in `arr`.
- The length and range constraints on `arr` remain unchanged, as they are part of the initial state and are not modified by the loop.
