Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks. A regular polygon requires at least 3 sides, but since the program divides the count of each stick length by 4, it is implicitly assuming that the polygons being constructed are squares (which is a specific type of regular polygon). However, this assumption is not aligned with the problem statement, which asks for the maximum number of regular polygons, not just squares. Therefore, the logic in `func_1` is flawed because it only considers squares and ignores other possible regular polygons like equilateral triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider all possible regular polygons and not just squares. For example, if there are 3 sticks of the same length, they can form an equilateral triangle, which would contribute to the total count of regular polygons.

Given the current implementation, the program will fail to produce the correct output for test cases where non-square regular polygons can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
