Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be formed from the sticks, but it does not account for other types of regular polygons (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.). For example, consider the following input:

```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

The correct output should be `2`, as you can form two equilateral triangles (each using 3 sticks of length 2). However, the program will output `1`, because it only counts the number of squares that can be formed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
