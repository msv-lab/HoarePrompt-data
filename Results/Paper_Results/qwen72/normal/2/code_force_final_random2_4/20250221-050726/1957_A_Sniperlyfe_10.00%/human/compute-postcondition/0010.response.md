Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` (where the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100, and each element is between 1 and 100) and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in `arr` by 4. The function does not modify the input list `arr`. After the function concludes, the input list remains unchanged, and the returned value is the computed sum. **
