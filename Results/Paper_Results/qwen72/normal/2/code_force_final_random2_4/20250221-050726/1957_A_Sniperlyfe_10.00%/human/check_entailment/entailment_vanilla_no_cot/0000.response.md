Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be formed from the sticks, but it does not account for other possible regular polygons (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.). The problem statement requires finding the maximum number of any type of regular polygon, not just squares.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider all possible regular polygons and choose the combination that maximizes the total number of polygons formed. This involves checking the frequency of each stick length and determining how many polygons of different sides (from 3 to the number of sticks available) can be formed using those frequencies.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(arr)
    max_polygons = 0
    for length, count in freq.items():
        for sides in range(3, count + 1):
            max_polygons += count // sides
    return max_polygons

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))
```

This version correctly counts the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed, considering all possible side lengths.
