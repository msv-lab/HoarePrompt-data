The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers with the constraint that the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and 100. The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the frequency of occurrence of each integer in the list `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each integer in `arr` by 4.**
