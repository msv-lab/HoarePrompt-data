Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `x` is an input integer where \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5)\), `y` is an input integer, `_` is 2, `T` must be greater than 0, `list0` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`. If `num` is 1, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` (from index 0 to `x-2`) is exactly 1 plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` (from index 0 to `x-2`) is exactly 1.***
