The value of `prod` is updated by multiplying its current value with the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `prod` becomes `a[0] * a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is `a[0] * a[1]`, `i` is 1**
