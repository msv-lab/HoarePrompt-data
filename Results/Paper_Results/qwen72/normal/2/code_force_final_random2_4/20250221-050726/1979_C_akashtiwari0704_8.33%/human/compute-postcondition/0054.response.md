Output State: **`sumo` is now `sumo + int(a[1])`, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is now equal to `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is now equal to `prod // a[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[1]` to `sumo`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
