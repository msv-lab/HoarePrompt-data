You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of outcomes. k_1, k_2, ..., k_n are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `t - 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the modified elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, and each element in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[index]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further action is taken. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string representation of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, each followed by a space.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the number of outcomes `n` for each test case, and a list of multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` for each outcome. It processes each test case and returns the calculated results based on the provided multipliers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
