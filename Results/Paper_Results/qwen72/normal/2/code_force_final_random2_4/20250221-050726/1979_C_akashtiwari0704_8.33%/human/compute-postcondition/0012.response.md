Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sumo` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `i`) retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code snippet.
