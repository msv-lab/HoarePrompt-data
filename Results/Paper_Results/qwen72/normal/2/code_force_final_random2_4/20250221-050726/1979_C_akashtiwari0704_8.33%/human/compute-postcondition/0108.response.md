The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the described parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of outcomes for each test case.
- `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`: Integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.

Given these parameters, the function processes each test case and calculates the result based on the provided multipliers. However, the specific output is not detailed in the problem statement, so I'll describe the general functionality based on the typical behavior of such functions.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the number of outcomes `n` for each test case, and a list of multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` for each outcome. It processes each test case and returns the calculated results based on the provided multipliers.**
