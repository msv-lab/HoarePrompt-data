Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` contains `[b, b, b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a, a]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contained `[a, a]`, so after appending `a`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a, a]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
