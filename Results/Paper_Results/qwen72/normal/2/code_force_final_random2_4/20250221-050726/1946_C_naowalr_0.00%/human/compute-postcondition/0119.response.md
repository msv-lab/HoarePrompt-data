Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variables `t`, `z`, `L`, and `R` are updated based on the condition: if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is set to 50001 and `R` remains 100001; otherwise, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to 50001. The variable `numCuts` is either greater than `k`, equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to 50001, or less than or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than 50001. The variable `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = (L + R) // 2` updates the value of `x` to the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `x` is now calculated based on the current values of `L` and `R`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, so `x` becomes `(50001 + 100001) // 2 = 75001`.
- If `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than 50001, then `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, so `x` becomes `(1 + 50001) // 2 = 25001`.
