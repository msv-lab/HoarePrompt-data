Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. `t`, `z`, `L` is now `(L + R) // 2`, `R` remains unchanged, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**
