To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the expression `range(n - 1)` depends on `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `i` should start at 0 (the default starting value for `range`).
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged as it is not part of the loop head).
- `z` is 0 (unchanged as it is not part of the loop head).
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` (unchanged as it is not part of the loop head).

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 0**
