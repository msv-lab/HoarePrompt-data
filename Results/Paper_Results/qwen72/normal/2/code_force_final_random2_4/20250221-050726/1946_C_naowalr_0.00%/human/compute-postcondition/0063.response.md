Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each element `a` and `b` read from the input during the loop has been appended to `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001.**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to 100001 (which is `int(100000.0 + 1)`).
- All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, `L`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
