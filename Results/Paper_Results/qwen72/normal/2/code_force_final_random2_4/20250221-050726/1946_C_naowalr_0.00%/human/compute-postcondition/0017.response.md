Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `L` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `L = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `L`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `L`.
