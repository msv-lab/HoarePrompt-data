To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `R - L > 1`.

Given the current state:
- `R - L <= 1`
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

The condition `R - L > 1` must be true for the loop to execute. However, the current state indicates that `R - L <= 1`, which means the loop will not execute as it stands.

To make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust the values of `L` and `R` such that `R - L > 1`. Since `R` is already set to 100001, we can adjust `L` to be a value that ensures `R - L > 1`.

Let's set `L` to a value that satisfies this condition. For example, setting `L` to 99998 would make `R - L = 100001 - 99998 = 3`, which is greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each element `a` and `b` read from the input during the loop has been appended to `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1`, `L` is 99998, `R` is 100001**
