Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variables `t`, `z`, `L` is now 1, `R` is now 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. Additionally, either `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
