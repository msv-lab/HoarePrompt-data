The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the parameter `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n - 1`, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the specific integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`**
