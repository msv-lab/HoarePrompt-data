Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `adj[a]` is updated to include an additional `b`, making it `[b, b]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
- The structure of `adj` remains a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, except for the specific changes to `adj[a]` and `adj[b]`.
