The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` adds the integer `b` to the list located at index `a` in the `adj` list. This modifies the `adj` list.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the specific integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`.**
