The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by appending the integer `b` to the list located at index `a` in `adj`. This means that the list `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `z` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input
- `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates
- `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function
- `numCuts` is 0
- `R - L <= 1`

After executing the code snippet, the only change is in the `adj` list. Specifically, `adj[a]` now contains both `b` and the previously added elements (if any).

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`.**

Note: The repetition of `b` in `adj[a]` might be a typo in the description, but based on the given code, `adj[a]` will indeed contain `b` twice if it was already there. If `b` was not already in `adj[a]`, it will be added once.
