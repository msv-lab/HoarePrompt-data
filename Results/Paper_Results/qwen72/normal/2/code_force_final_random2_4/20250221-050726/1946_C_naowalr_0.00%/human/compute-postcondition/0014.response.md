Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input.** 

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` adds the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contained `[b, b]`, so after appending `b`, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, b]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
