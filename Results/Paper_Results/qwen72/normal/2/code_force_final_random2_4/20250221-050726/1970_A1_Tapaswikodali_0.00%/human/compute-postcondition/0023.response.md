To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last character in `s`.
   - `char` is the last character in `s`.
   - `balance` is 0.
   - `details` is a sorted list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`.

2. **Understanding the `details` List:**
   - For each character in `s`, a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` is created.
   - `balance` is the balance of parentheses up to the current character.
   - `-i` is the negative index of the current character, ensuring that the list is sorted in reverse order of indices.
   - `char` is the current character in `s`.

3. **Sorting the `details` List:**
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the tuples `(balance, -i, char)`.
   - Since `balance` is the primary key, the list is first sorted by the balance.
   - If two tuples have the same balance, they are then sorted by `-i`, which ensures that characters with the same balance are ordered from the end of the string to the beginning.
   - Finally, if two tuples have the same balance and index, they are sorted by `char`.

4. **Constructing the `result` String:**
   - The `result` string is constructed by concatenating the `char` values from the sorted `details` list.
   - This means the characters in `s` are reordered based on the sorting criteria described above.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Given that `s` is a string of balanced parentheses, the `balance` will always return to 0 at the end of the string.
   - The sorting criteria ensure that the characters are rearranged in a way that maintains the balance but may change the order of matching parentheses pairs.

Since the exact content of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact string `result` will contain. However, based on the sorting criteria, the `result` string will be a valid string of balanced parentheses, potentially in a different order from the original `s`.

Output: **result (where result is a string of balanced parentheses, potentially in a different order from the original s)**
