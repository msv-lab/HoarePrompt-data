Functionality: ** The function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", which forms a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It processes this string to maintain a balance count and records details about each character. After processing, it sorts these details and constructs a new string `result` that is also a valid balanced parentheses sequence, potentially in a different order from the original `s`. The function then prints this new string `result`. The final state of the program is that the original string `s` remains unchanged, and the new string `result` is printed to the console. **
