The value of `balance` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `balance` depends on the value of `char`. If `char` is '(', `balance` is initially 3, and if `char` is ')', `balance` is initially -3. After decrementing `balance` by 1, the new value of `balance` will be 2 if `char` is '(', and -4 if `char` is ')'. The `details` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character in `s`. If `char` is '(', `balance` is 2. If `char` is ')', `balance` is -4. `details` is a list containing the tuples `(balance + 1, 0, char)`, `(balance + 1, -1, char)`, and `(balance + 1, -2, char)`**
