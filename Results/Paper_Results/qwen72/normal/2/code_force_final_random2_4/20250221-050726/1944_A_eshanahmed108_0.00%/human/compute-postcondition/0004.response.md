The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input, while `_` remains a placeholder and `t` retains its original value.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
