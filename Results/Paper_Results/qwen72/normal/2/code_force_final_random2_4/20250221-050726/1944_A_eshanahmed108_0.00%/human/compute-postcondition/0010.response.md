The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. `n` represents the number of islands, and `k` represents the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed.

The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but typically, such a function would return a result for each test case, possibly indicating the maximum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying up to `k` bridges, or some other relevant metric based on the problem context.

Given the lack of specific output details, I will describe the functionality based on the most likely scenario:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of islands, and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the input parameters `n` and `k`.**
