The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the length of the list `c`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
  - `q`: An integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
  - `c`: A list of `n` integers, where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
  - `queries`: A list of `q` queries, each query consisting of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

The function processes each test case and returns the results for each query. The exact nature of the result for each query is not specified in the given information, but it is implied that the function performs some operation on the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]` for each query and returns the result.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of list `c`), `q` (number of queries), a list `c` of integers, and a list of `q` queries. For each query, the function processes the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]` and returns the result of this processing for each query.**
