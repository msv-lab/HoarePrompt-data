The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is used as a placeholder and is set to `m + 1` before the loop starts, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0.

State: **`_` is `m + 1`, `m` must be greater than 0**
