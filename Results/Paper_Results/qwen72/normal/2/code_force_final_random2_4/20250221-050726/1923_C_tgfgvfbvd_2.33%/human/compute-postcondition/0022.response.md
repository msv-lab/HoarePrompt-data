Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is set to 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, with `m` being greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers based on user input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers based on user input.
- If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0 (i.e., `a` is at least 2), then `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`.
- Additionally, `b - a + 1` is greater than 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2 times `(b - a + 1)`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Explanation:
- The conditions specified ensure that `s` is calculated correctly based on the values of `a` and `b`.
- The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the range between `a` and `b` is valid and contains at least two elements.
- The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that the sum `s` meets a specific threshold relative to the number of elements in the range.

Since all these conditions are met, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
