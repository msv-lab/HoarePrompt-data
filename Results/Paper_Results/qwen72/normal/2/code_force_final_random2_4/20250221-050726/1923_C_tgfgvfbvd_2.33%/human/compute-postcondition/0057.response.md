Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers with any number of elements, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**

### Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `_` remains `m + 1`.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain as input integers.
- The list `l` can have any number of elements (it must have at least one element for the loop to execute).
- The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `p` will be `[1, 3, 6, 10]` after the loop completes.
- The variable `c` will be the sum of all elements in `l`. For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `c` will be `10` after the loop completes.
