Postcondition: ***`_` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains the value of `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, if `(b - a + 1) > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition holds. Otherwise, either `(b - a + 1) <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`.***
