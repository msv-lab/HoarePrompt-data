Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. `_` is `m + 1`, where `m` is greater than 0.
2. `a` and `b` are input integers.
3. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
4. Otherwise, `s` remains the value of `p[b - 1]`.
5. The difference `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1.
6. `s` is at least twice the value of `(b - a + 1)`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

- The `print` statement is simply `print('YES')`.
- This means the output will always be the string `'YES'`.

However, we need to ensure that the conditions leading up to this `print` statement are met. Let's verify:

1. `m` is greater than 0, so `_` is a positive integer.
2. `a` and `b` are input integers.
3. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
4. If `a` is less than 2, `s` is simply `p[b - 1]`.
5. The difference `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1, meaning `b` is at least `a + 1`.
6. `s` is at least twice the value of `(b - a + 1)`.

Since the conditions are met, the `print` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
