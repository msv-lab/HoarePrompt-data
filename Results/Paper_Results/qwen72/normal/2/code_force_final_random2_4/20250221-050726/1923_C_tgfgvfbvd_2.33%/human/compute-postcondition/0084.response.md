Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, then `s` is updated according to the conditions: if `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. If these conditions are not met, `s` is still updated in the same way: if `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.***
