The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the current value of `i` and the length of `num`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, and `num` has at least 2 characters. The loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`. Since `i` is currently `len(num) - 2`, it will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, making it `len(num) - 3`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be non-negative, meaning `len(num) - 3` must be greater than or equal to `0`. This implies that `len(num)` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is a string representation of the original integer value of `num` and has at least 3 characters, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, `tot` is 2**.
