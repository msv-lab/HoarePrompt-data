Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to verify that it meets the requirements of the problem statement and that the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` is sound.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns modifying a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen integer.
   - Sasha concatenates two integers and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move (i.e., when there is only one number left).
   - Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**:
     - This function calculates the total length of the string representations of the numbers in `nums` and subtracts the sum of every second element in a sorted list of zero counts of each number in `nums`.
     - The idea is to simulate the effect of Anna's and Sasha's moves on the total length of the numbers.
     - The function returns 'Sasha' if the resulting total is greater than or equal to `m + 1`; otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
   - **`zerocnts(num)`**:
     - This function counts the trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.
     - It is used to help `func_1` determine the impact of reversing digits on the total length.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - **Total Length Calculation**:
     - The total length of the string representations of the numbers is calculated using `sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))`.
     - This correctly represents the initial total length of the numbers.
   - **Trailing Zeros Count**:
     - The function `zerocnts` correctly counts the trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.
     - This is used to adjust the total length in `func_1` to account for the effect of reversing digits.
   - **Subtracting Every Second Element**:
     - The loop `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2): tot -= cntvals[i]` subtracts the count of trailing zeros for every second element in the sorted list of zero counts.
     - This simulates the effect of Sasha's moves, where he concatenates two numbers, reducing the total length by the count of trailing zeros of one of the numbers.
   - **Winning Condition**:
     - The condition `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'` correctly determines the winner based on whether the final number is at least \(10^m\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as single-element lists and large values of `m` correctly.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program should work efficiently within the given limits.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
