### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - **Anna's Move:** Anna reverses the digits of a single number in the list. This operation does not change the total number of digits in the list.
   - **Sasha's Move:** Sasha concatenates two numbers and replaces them with the concatenated result. This reduces the number of elements in the list by one but increases the total number of digits in the list.
   - The game ends when there is only one number left in the list. Sasha wins if this number has at least \(10^m\) digits; otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of digits in the list remains constant after Anna's move because reversing a number does not change its length.
   - Sasha's move reduces the number of elements but increases the total number of digits. The key is to track the total number of digits and how it changes over the game.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**:
     - `tot` is initialized as the total number of digits in the list.
     - `cntvals` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in each number, sorted in descending order.
     - The loop iterates over `cntvals` in steps of 2, subtracting the number of trailing zeros from `tot`. This simulates Sasha's optimal strategy of concatenating numbers with the most trailing zeros first.
     - Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the total number of digits is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\); otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.

   - **`zerocnts(num)`**:
     - Converts the number to a string and counts the number of trailing zeros.
     - This function is used to determine the number of trailing zeros in each number, which helps in the optimal strategy for Sasha.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game dynamics by tracking the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros.
   - The use of trailing zeros is crucial because concatenating numbers with trailing zeros can significantly increase the total number of digits.
   - The condition `tot >= m + 1` correctly determines if the final number has at least \(10^m\) digits.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
