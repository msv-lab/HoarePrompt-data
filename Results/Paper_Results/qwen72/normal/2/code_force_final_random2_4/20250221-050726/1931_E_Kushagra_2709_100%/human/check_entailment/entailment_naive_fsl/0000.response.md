Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the total number of digits in the list and then subtracts the counts of trailing zeros in a way that does not accurately reflect the game's rules. The game involves reversing digits and concatenating numbers, but the solution only considers the total number of digits and trailing zeros, which is insufficient to determine the winner correctly.

A specific case where the program fails is:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 2`, `nums = [14, 2]`
- Expected Output: `Sasha`
- Actual Output: `Anna`

In this case, Anna can reverse the number 2 to get 2, and then Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha should win, but the program incorrectly outputs `Anna`. This indicates that the program does not correctly simulate the game's rules and outcomes.
