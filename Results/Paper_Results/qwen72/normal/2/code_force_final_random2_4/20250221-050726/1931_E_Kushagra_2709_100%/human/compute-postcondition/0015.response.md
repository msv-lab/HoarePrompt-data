Output State: **`num` remains as the string representation of the original integer value of `num`. The variable `i` is the index of the first non-zero digit from the right (or -1 if all digits are zero). The variable `tot` is the count of trailing zeros in `num`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from the last character of `num` to the first character, checking each character.
- If a character is not '0', the loop breaks, and `i` is set to the index of this character.
- The variable `tot` counts the number of trailing zeros (from the end of the string to the first non-zero character).
- If all characters in `num` are '0', the loop will iterate through all characters, and `i` will be -1 after the loop ends.
- The variable `num` itself does not change during the loop execution.
