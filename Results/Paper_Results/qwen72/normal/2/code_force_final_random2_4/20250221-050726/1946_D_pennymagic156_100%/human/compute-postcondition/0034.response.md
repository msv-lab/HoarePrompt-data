Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the XOR of all elements in the original `a` that contributed to making `op` 0 at some point during the loop, `val` is the last element of the original `a`, `op` is the XOR of the bits at position 29 of all elements in the original `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in the original `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is 0, and `t` is an empty list.**
