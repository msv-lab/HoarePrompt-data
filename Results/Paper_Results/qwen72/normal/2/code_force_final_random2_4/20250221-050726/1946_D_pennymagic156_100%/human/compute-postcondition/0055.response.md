Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (-1) and `cnt`, `i` is 29, `u` is 1, `v` is even, `op` is the XOR of the 30th bits of all elements in `a`, and `cnt` is the number of elements in `a` whose 30th bit contributes to making `op` equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value (`-1`) and the value of `cnt`.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `op`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
