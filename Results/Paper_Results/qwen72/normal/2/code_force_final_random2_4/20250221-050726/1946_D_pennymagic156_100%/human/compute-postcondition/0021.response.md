The value of `op` is updated by performing an XOR operation with the result of `val >> i & 1`. This means the least significant bit of `op` is toggled based on the result of the bitwise operation `val >> i & 1`.

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `a` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers with the first element being 0.
- `val` remains the second element of `a`.
- `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`.
- If `op` was 0 before the operation, it will now be 1 if `val >> i & 1` is 1, or it will remain 0 if `val >> i & 1` is 0.
- `t` remains a list containing [0].
- `ai` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with the first element being 0, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`, `t` is a list containing [0], `ai` is 0.**
