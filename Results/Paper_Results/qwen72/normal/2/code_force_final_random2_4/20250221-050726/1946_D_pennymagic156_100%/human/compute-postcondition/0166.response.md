Postcondition: ***`u` is 1, `v` is either 0 or even and non-zero, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `i` is 27. If `v` is even and non-zero, `ans` is the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit (from the right) is 0, `op` is the result of XORing the 28th bit (from the right) of each element in `a`, and `cnt` is the count of times `op` was 0 during the loop iterations. If `v` is 0, `ans` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
