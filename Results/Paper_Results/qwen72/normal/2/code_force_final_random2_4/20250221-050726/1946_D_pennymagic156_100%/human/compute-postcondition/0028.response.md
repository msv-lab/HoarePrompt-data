The operation `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR between `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with the first element being 0
- `val` is the third element of `a`
- `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`
- If `op` is False, `t` is a list containing [0, `val`] and `ai` is 0
- Otherwise, `t` remains a list containing [0] and `ai` is equal to `val`

After executing `ai ^= val`:
- If `op` is False, `ai` was initially 0, so `ai` becomes `val` (since 0 XOR val = val).
- If `op` is True, `ai` was initially `val`, so `ai` becomes 0 (since val XOR val = 0).

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with the first element being 0
- `val` is the third element of `a`
- `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`
- If `op` is False, `t` is a list containing [0, `val`] and `ai` is `val`
- If `op` is True, `t` remains a list containing [0] and `ai` is 0

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with the first element being 0, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`, if `op` is False, `t` is a list containing [0, `val`] and `ai` is `val`, otherwise, `t` remains a list containing [0] and `ai` is 0.**
