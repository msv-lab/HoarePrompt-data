The code snippet `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`. Given the initial state:

- `u` is the 28th bit of `x`
- `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 3 elements
- `t` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is a list containing the second element of `a`
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 27
- `op` is 0
- `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is `val`
- `val` is the third element in the list `a`

Since `op` is 0, `ai` is initially 0. The value of `val` is the third element in the list `a`.

After executing `ai ^= val`, the new value of `ai` is the result of the bitwise XOR between 0 and `val`, which is simply `val`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 3 elements, `t` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `ai` is `val`, and `val` is the third element in the list `a`.**
