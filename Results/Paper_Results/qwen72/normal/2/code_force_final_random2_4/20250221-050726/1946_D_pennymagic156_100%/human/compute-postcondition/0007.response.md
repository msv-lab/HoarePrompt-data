Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29. If `u` (the bit at position 29 in `x`) and `v` (the sum of the bits at position 29 in each element of `a`) are both 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
