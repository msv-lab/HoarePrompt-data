Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `val` is the last element processed in the loop.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 2 elements, `t` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is a list containing the second element of `a`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is the 28th bit of `val`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is `val`, and `val` is the second element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 3 elements, `t` is a list containing the first and third elements of `a`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, and `val` is the third element in the list `a`. If `op` is not 0, the state remains unchanged as per the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
