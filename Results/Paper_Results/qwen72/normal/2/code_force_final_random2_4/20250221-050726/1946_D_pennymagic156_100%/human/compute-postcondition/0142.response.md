Output State: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is now a list containing the elements from `t` where the 28th bit (bit 27) is 0, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is the XOR of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is 0, and `val` is the last element processed in the loop.**

Explanation:
- The line `a, t = t, []` swaps the values of `a` and `t`. After this operation, `a` now contains the elements from `t` where the 28th bit (bit 27) is 0, and `t` is an empty list.
- All other variables (`u`, `v`, `n`, `x`, `ans`, `i`, `op`, `ai`, and `val`) remain unchanged.
