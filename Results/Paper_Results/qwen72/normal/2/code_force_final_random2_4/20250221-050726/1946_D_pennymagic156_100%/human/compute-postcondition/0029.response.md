The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Based on the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with the first element being 0.
- `val` is the third element of `a`.
- `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`.
- If `op` is False, `t` is a list containing `[0, val]` and `ai` is `val`.
- Otherwise, `t` remains a list containing `[0]` and `ai` is 0.

After executing `t.append(ai)`:

- If `op` is False, `t` will be `[0, val, val]` and `ai` remains `val`.
- If `op` is True, `t` will be `[0, 0]` and `ai` remains 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with the first element being 0, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`, if `op` is False, `t` is `[0, val, val]` and `ai` is `val`, otherwise, `t` is `[0, 0]` and `ai` is 0.**
