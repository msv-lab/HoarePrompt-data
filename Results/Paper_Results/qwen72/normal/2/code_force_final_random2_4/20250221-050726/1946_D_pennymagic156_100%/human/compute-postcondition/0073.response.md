Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element. `val` is the first element in `a`. If `op` is 0, `val` is 0, and `t` is a list that now contains the value of `ai`. `ai` is 0. If `op` is not 0, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the `i`-th bit of `val`, and the element `ai` in the list `a` is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of `ai` and `val`. If `ai` is the first element, it is now 0.***
