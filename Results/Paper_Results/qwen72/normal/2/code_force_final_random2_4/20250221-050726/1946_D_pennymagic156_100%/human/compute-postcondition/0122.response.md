The code snippet `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`. Given the initial state:

- `ai` is 0
- `val` is the first element in the list `a`

After executing the code, `ai` will be updated to the result of `0 ^ val`, which simplifies to just `val`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is `0 ^ (val >> 27 & 1)`, `ai` is `val`, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**
