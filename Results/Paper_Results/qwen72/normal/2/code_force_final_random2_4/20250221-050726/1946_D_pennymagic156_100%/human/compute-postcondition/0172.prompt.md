You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, x is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\), and a is a list of n non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).
def func_5():
    n, x = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    t, ans = [], -1
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
        
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                a, t = t, []
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` whose bits contributed to making `op` 0 at some point during the loop, and `i` is -1.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a`. Here, `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` whose bits contributed to making `op` 0 at some point during the loop, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). The function returns `-1` in multiple cases, including when `v` is 0 or odd. If `v` is even and non-zero, it returns the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit is 0. In another case, it returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`, where `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` whose bits contributed to making `op` 0 during the loop.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1.

Case_2: The program returns -1.

Case_3: The program returns -1 if `v` is 0, or the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit (from the right) is 0 if `v` is even and non-zero. If `v` is odd, the program returns -1.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a`. Here, `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` whose bits contributed to making `op` 0 at some point during the loop, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
