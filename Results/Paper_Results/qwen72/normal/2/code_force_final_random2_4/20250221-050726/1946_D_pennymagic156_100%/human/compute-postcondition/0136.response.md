The given code snippet updates the value of `op` using the XOR operation with the 28th bit of `val`. Let's break down the impact:

- `op` is initially the 28th bit of `val`.
- `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by 27 bits (since `i` is 27) and then applies a bitwise AND with 1, effectively extracting the 28th bit of `val`.
- `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs an XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the 28th bit of `val`.

Since `op` is already the 28th bit of `val`, performing an XOR with itself results in `op` becoming 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 3 elements, `t` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is a list containing the second element of `a`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is `val`, and `val` is the third element in the list `a`.**
