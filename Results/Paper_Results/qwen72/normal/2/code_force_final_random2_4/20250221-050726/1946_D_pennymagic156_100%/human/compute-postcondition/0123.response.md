The code snippet `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `ai` and `val`, and then assigns the result back to `ai`.

Given the initial state:
- `u` is the 28th bit of `x`
- `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 27
- `op` is `0 ^ (val >> 27 & 1)`
- `ai` is 0
- `val` is the first element in the list `a`

After executing `ai ^= val`:
- `ai` is now equal to `0 ^ val`, which simplifies to `val` because `0 ^ val` is just `val`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `u` is the 28th bit of `x`
- `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 27
- `op` is `0 ^ (val >> 27 & 1)`
- `ai` is `val`
- `val` is the first element in the list `a`

Output State: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is `0 ^ (val >> 27 & 1)`, `ai` is `val`, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**
