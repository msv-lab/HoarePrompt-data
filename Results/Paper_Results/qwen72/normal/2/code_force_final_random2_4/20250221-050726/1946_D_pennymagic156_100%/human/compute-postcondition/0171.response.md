The function `func_5` accepts parameters `n`, `x`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, `x` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).

- **Case_1**: The program returns `-1`.
- **Case_2**: The program returns `-1`.
- **Case_3**: The program returns `-1` if `v` is 0, or the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit (from the right) is 0 if `v` is even and non-zero. If `v` is odd, the program returns `-1`.
- **Case_4**: The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a`. Here, `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` whose bits contributed to making `op` 0 at some point during the loop.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). The function returns `-1` in multiple cases, including when `v` is 0 or odd. If `v` is even and non-zero, it returns the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit is 0. In another case, it returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`, where `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` whose bits contributed to making `op` 0 during the loop.**
