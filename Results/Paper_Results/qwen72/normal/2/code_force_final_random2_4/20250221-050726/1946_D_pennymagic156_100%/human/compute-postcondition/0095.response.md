The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation. It shifts the value of `val` right by `i` positions, then applies a bitwise AND with 1 to get the least significant bit of the shifted value, and finally XORs this result with `op`.

Given the initial state:
- `u` is 1
- `v` is even and non-zero
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 28
- `op` is 0
- `cnt` is 0

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `val >> i` shifts `val` right by 28 positions.
2. `val >> i & 1` extracts the least significant bit of the shifted value.
3. `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates `op` by performing an XOR with the extracted bit.

Since `op` is initially 0, the result of the XOR operation will be the value of the least significant bit of `val` after shifting it right by 28 positions.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `u` is 1
- `v` is even and non-zero
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 28
- `op` is the least significant bit of `val` after shifting it right by 28 positions
- `cnt` is 0

Output State: **`u` is 1, `v` is even and non-zero, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `op` is the least significant bit of `val` after shifting it right by 28 positions, `cnt` is 0**
