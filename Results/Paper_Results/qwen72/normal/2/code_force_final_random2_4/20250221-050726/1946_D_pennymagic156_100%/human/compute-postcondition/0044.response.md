Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 1, `v` is even, `op` is the 30th bit of `val` and its current value is 0, `cnt` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial value of `cnt` was 0, so after the increment, `cnt` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
