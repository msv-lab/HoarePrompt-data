The given code snippet updates the value of `op` using the XOR operation with the result of shifting `val` right by `i` positions and then taking the bitwise AND with 1. Let's break down the impact:

- `op ^= val >> i & 1`: This line modifies `op` by performing an XOR operation with the least significant bit of `val` after shifting it right by `i` positions (which is 28).

Given the initial state:
- `u` is 1
- `v` is even and non-zero
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 28
- `op` is the least significant bit of `val` after shifting it right by 28 positions
- If `op` is 0, `cnt` is increased by 1

After executing the code:
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)`

The output state is:
- `u` is 1
- `v` is even and non-zero
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 28
- `op` is `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)`
- If `op` was 0 before the operation and `val >> 28 & 1` is 1, `op` becomes 1. If `op` was 1 before the operation and `val >> 28 & 1` is 1, `op` becomes 0. If `op` was 0 before the operation and `val >> 28 & 1` is 0, `op` remains 0. If `op` was 1 before the operation and `val >> 28 & 1` is 0, `op` remains 1.

Output State: **`u` is 1, `v` is even and non-zero, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `op` is `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)`**
