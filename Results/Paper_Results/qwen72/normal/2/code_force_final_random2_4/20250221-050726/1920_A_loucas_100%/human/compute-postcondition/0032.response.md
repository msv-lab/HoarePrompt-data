Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input. `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 2, and `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 3.**

Explanation:
- The variable `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1` after the loop completes, as it increments from 0 to `innerLoop - 1`.
- The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain the values of `a` based on the corresponding values of `x` from the input. Specifically:
  - `big` will contain all values of `a` where `x` was 1.
  - `less` will contain all values of `a` where `x` was 2.
  - `no` will contain all values of `a` where `x` was 3.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, and `innerLoop` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
