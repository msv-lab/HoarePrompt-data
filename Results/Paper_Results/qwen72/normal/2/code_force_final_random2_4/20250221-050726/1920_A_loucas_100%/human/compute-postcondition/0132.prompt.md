Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `num` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the second integer from the input, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, if `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the second integer from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `num` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two instances of the new `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing one instance of the new `a`, `less` is a list containing one instance of the new `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is a list containing one instance of the new `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing one instance of the new `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 1, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, and `num` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing three instances of `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing two instances of `a`, `less` is a list containing one instance of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is a list containing two instances of `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing one instance of `a`. If `x` is not 1, and the else part is executed, `big` is a list containing two instances of `a`, `less` is a list containing one instance of `a`, and `no` is a list containing one instance of `a`. If `x` is 2, and the else part is executed, `big` is a list containing one instance of `a`, `less` is a list containing two instances of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, and the else part is executed, `big` is a list containing one instance of `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing two instances of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
