The code `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `big`. The value of `a` is the second integer from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and its current value is 1, `a` is the second integer from the input, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0.**
