The code snippet `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. The value of `num` was initially defined as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. After decrementing, the new value of `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `no`, and `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.**
