Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `num` is 0. `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 2, and `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 3.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `innerLoop` times, with `iterable2` ranging from 0 to `innerLoop - 1`.
- For each iteration, the values of `x` and `a` are read from the input.
- Depending on the value of `x`:
  - If `x` is 1, `a` is appended to the list `big`.
  - If `x` is 2, `a` is appended to the list `less`.
  - If `x` is 3, `a` is appended to the list `no`.
- After all iterations, `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain the respective values of `a` based on the conditions described above.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `loop`, `iterable`, and `num` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
