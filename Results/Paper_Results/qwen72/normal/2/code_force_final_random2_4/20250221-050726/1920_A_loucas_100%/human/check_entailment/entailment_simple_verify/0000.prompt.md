You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is equal to the initial value of `loop`, `iterable` is `loop - 1`, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` contains elements that were not 1 or 2, and `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - k`, where `k` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`. If `num` is less than 1, the loop skips the current iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Handling Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it appends the value to the appropriate list (`big`, `less`, or `no`) based on the type of constraint.
3. **Calculating Range**:
   - It calculates the range of valid values for `k` using `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This ensures that `k` is within the bounds specified by the constraints of type 1 and type 2.
4. **Excluding Specific Values**:
   - It iterates through the list of values that `k` must not be equal to (`no`) and subtracts 1 from the count if the value falls within the calculated range.
5. **Output**:
   - It prints the final count of valid values for `k`.

The program correctly handles edge cases such as when the range is invalid (i.e., `min(less) < max(big)`) by printing 0. It also correctly excludes specific values that fall within the valid range.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
