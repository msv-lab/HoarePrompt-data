You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        print(num)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints and then processes each constraint to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. Specifically, it calculates the range of valid `k` values based on the minimum of "less than" constraints and the maximum of "greater than" constraints. It then subtracts the count of "not equal" constraints that fall within this range. The function prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case. If no valid `k` exists, it prints 0. The function does not return any values; it only prints results to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).

2. **Constraint Collection:**
   - It initializes three lists: `less`, `big`, and `no` to store the constraints of type 2, type 1, and type 3, respectively.
   - It iterates through the constraints and appends them to the appropriate list based on their type.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - It calculates the minimum value from the `less` list and the maximum value from the `big` list.
   - The potential range of valid `k` values is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

4. **Invalid Range Check:**
   - If the calculated range is less than 1, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.

5. **Exclusion of Forbidden Values:**
   - It iterates through the `no` list and checks if any of these values fall within the calculated range.
   - If a forbidden value is found within the range, it decrements the count of valid `k` values.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the number of valid `k` values for the current test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the constraints and calculates the range of valid `k` values.
- It correctly excludes the forbidden values from the range.
- The edge cases, such as when the range is invalid (i.e., `min(less) - max(big) + 1 < 1`), are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
