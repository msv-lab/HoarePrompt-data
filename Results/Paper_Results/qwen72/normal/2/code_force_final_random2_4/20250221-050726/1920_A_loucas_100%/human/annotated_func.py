#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. a denotes the type of constraint: if a=1, k must be ≥ x; if a=2, k must be ≤ x; if a=3, k must be ≠ x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the exact same.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is equal to the initial value of `loop`, `iterable` is `loop - 1`, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` contains elements that were not 1 or 2, and `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - k`, where `k` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`. If `num` is less than 1, the loop skips the current iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints and then processes each constraint to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. Specifically, it calculates the range of valid `k` values based on the minimum of "less than" constraints and the maximum of "greater than" constraints. It then subtracts the count of "not equal" constraints that fall within this range. The function prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case. If no valid `k` exists, it prints 0. The function does not return any values; it only prints results to the console.
