To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- Each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- `loop` is an input integer.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for iterable in range(loop):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `range(loop)` generates a sequence of numbers. This means `loop` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `iterable` is the loop counter, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `loop` must be greater than 0.
- The initial value of `iterable` is 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0**
