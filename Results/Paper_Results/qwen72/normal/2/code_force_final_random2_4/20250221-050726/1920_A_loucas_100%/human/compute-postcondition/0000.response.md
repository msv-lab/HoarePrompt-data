The code snippet `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. This does not affect the initial state of `t`, `n`, or the constraints, but it introduces a new variable `loop` with a specific value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` is an input integer.**
