Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - count`, where `count` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`**

Explanation:
- The line `no = []` reassigns `no` to an empty list, overriding its previous value.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, `a`, `big`, `less`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
