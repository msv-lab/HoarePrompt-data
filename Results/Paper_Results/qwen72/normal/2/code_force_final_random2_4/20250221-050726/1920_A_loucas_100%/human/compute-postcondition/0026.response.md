Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `big`, `less`, and `no` are empty lists.**

Explanation:
- The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `a` respectively.
- The initial state specifies that `x` and `a` are derived from the input, so their values are updated accordingly.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`) remain unchanged.
- The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are initially empty and remain empty since no operations modify them in this code snippet.
