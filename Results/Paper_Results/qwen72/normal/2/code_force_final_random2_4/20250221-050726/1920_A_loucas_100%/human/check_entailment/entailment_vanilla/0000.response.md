### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).

2. **Constraint Collection:**
   - It initializes three lists: `less`, `big`, and `no` to store the constraints of type 2, type 1, and type 3, respectively.
   - It iterates through the constraints and appends them to the appropriate list based on their type.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - It calculates the minimum value from the `less` list and the maximum value from the `big` list.
   - The potential range of valid `k` values is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

4. **Invalid Range Check:**
   - If the calculated range is less than 1, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.

5. **Exclusion of Forbidden Values:**
   - It iterates through the `no` list and checks if any of these values fall within the calculated range.
   - If a forbidden value is found within the range, it decrements the count of valid `k` values.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the number of valid `k` values for the current test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the constraints and calculates the range of valid `k` values.
- It correctly excludes the forbidden values from the range.
- The edge cases, such as when the range is invalid (i.e., `min(less) - max(big) + 1 < 1`), are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description.
