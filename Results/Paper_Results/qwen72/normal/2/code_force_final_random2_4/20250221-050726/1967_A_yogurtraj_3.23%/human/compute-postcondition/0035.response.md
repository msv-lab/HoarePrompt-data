Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[2]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 3`, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is `a[3]`, and the conditions for `rem` and `y` remain the same as they depend on the updated value of `k`.***
