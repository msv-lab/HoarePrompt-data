Postcondition: ***`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `r` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `i` is 0, and `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[1]`, and `y` is 0.***
