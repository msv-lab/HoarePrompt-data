The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `y` is `n - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.

Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 1, `rem` is `k % 2`, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, and `k` is `k - (a[1] - a[0])`.**
