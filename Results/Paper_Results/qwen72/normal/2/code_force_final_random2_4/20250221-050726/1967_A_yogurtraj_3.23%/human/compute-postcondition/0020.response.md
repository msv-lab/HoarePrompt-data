Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `i` is 1, and `k` is either 0 or `k - (a[1] - a[0])`.**

Explanation:
- The code `rem = k % (i + 1)` updates the value of `rem` to `k % 2` because `i` is 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
