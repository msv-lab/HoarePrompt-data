The value of `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `r` is now assigned the value of `a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[2]`, `rem` is either `k % 1` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `i` is 1, and `k` is either 0 or `k - (a[1] - a[0]) - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.**
