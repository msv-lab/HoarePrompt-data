The function `func` accepts no direct parameters but operates under the constraints provided for multiple test cases. Each test case includes three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is the number of distinct types of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `k` is the number of coins available to buy new cards (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). Additionally, for each test case, there is a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12) representing the initial number of cards of each type. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns the result for each case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct card types (`n`), the number of coins available (`k`), and a list of initial card counts (`a`). It returns the result for each test case.**
