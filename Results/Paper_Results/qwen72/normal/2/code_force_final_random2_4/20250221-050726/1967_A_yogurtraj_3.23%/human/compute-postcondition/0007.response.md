The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` should start at 0, as specified in the loop range.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 0. The other variables (`ii`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, `y`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`ii` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0**
