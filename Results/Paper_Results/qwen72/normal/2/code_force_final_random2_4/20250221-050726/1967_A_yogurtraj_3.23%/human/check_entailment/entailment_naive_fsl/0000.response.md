Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, reads the inputs, sorts the array of card counts, and calculates the maximum score by determining how many additional cards can be bought to maximize the number of valid permutations of length `n` within the rearranged sequence. The logic for distributing the coins to buy additional cards and calculating the resulting score seems to align with the problem requirements. No obvious edge cases or logical errors are present that would cause the program to fail for any valid input within the specified constraints.
