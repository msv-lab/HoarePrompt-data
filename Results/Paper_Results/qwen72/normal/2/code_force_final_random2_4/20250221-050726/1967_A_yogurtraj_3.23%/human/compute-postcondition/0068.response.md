Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `r` is `a[2]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, and `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `r` is now `a[2]`.
- All other variables (`ii`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
