Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a new input string, `a` is determined based on the count of '1' in the new `s`: If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is 'TRIANGLE'; if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, then `a` is 0; if the count of '1' in `s` is 0, then `a` is 0. `b` is 'SQUARE'.**
