You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0

                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `j` is `n-1`. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it means that at least one input string `s` had exactly one '1' in the last iteration. If `a` is 0, it means no input string `s` had exactly one '1' in the last iteration. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` had more than one '1' in the last iteration; otherwise, `b` is an empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a grid of characters ('0' or '1'). For each test case, it determines and prints whether the grid represents a "TRIANGLE" or a "SQUARE" based on the pattern of '1's. A "TRIANGLE" is identified if any row in the grid has exactly one '1', while a "SQUARE" is identified if any row has more than one '1'. If no row has exactly one '1', the function defaults to printing "SQUARE". After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid.

2. **Shape Detection Logic**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row in the grid, it counts the number of '1's in the row.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE', it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

4. **Flaws in Logic**:
   - The logic for detecting a triangle is flawed. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially as it grows larger. The current logic only checks if a row has exactly one '1', which is not sufficient to identify a triangle.
   - The logic for detecting a square is also flawed. A square can have rows with exactly one '1' if it is a very small square (e.g., 2x2). The current logic assumes that any row with more than one '1' is part of a square, which is not always true.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify a triangle, we need to check if the number of '1's in each row forms a pattern of increasing or decreasing odd numbers centered around a column.
   - To correctly identify a square, we need to check if each row has the same number of consecutive '1's starting from the same column.

Given the flaws in the logic, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
