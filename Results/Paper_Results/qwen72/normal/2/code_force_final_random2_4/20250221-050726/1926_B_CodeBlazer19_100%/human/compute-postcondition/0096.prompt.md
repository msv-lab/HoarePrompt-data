Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by `n` lines of `n` characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'TRIANGLE'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'SQUARE'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, and `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', then `a` remains 'TRIANGLE'. If `a` is 0, then `a` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it indicates that at least one input string `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop. If `a` is 0, it indicates that no input string `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop. In both cases, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1' character during the loop; otherwise, `b` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `j` is `n-1`. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it means an input string `s` had exactly one '1'. If `a` is 0, it means no input string `s` had exactly one '1'. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` had more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
