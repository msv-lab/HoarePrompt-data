The code snippet `b = 'SQUARE'` assigns the string `'SQUARE'` to the variable `b`. This overrides any previous value of `b` that was determined based on the count of '1' in the string `s`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a new input string, `a` is determined based on the count of '1' in `s` (if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is 'TRIANGLE'; if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, then `a` is 0; if the count of '1' in `s` is 0, then `a` is 0), and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**
