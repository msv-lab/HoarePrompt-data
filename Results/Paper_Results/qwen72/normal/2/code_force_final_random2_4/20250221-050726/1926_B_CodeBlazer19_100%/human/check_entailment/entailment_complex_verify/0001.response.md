Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid. This part of the code is correct.

2. **Shape Detection Logic**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row in the grid, it counts the number of '1's in the row.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE', it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

4. **Flaws in Logic**:
   - The logic for detecting a triangle is indeed flawed. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially as it grows larger. The current logic only checks if a row has exactly one '1', which is not sufficient to identify a triangle. For example, a triangle with `k=3` would have rows with 1, 3, and 5 '1's respectively.
   - The logic for detecting a square is also flawed. A square can have rows with exactly one '1' if it is a very small square (e.g., 2x2). The current logic assumes that any row with more than one '1' is part of a square, which is not always true. For example, a 2x2 square would have rows with 2 '1's each.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify a triangle, we need to check if the number of '1's in each row forms a pattern of increasing or decreasing odd numbers centered around a column.
   - To correctly identify a square, we need to check if each row has the same number of consecutive '1's starting from the same column.

Given the flaws in the logic, the provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
