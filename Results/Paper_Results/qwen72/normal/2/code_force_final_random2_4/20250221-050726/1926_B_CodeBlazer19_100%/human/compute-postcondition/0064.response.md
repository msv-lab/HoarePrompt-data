The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it indicates that at least one input string `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop. If `a` is 0, it indicates that no input string `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop. In both cases, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1' character during the loop; otherwise, `b` is an empty string.**
