The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is an input string. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the count of '1' in `s` is 0, then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**
