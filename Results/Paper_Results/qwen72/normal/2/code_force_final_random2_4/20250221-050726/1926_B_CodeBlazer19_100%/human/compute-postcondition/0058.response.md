Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any input string `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop; otherwise, `a` is 0. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1' character during the loop; otherwise, `b` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains the same as it is the input integer that determines the number of iterations.
- The variable `j` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, as the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop. Otherwise, `a` will remain 0.
- The variable `b` will be 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1' character during the loop. Otherwise, `b` will remain an empty string.
