Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is `(n, s)`, where `n` is an integer read from the corresponding line of input, and `s` is a string read from the corresponding line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. `_` is `t-1`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` remains the same as it was initially read from the input. The list `cases` now contains `t` tuples, each representing a pair of values read from the input during each iteration of the loop. The variable `_` is incremented with each iteration and will be equal to `t-1` after the final iteration. Each tuple in `cases` consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`, both of which are read from the input and processed (stripped of leading and trailing whitespace) during each iteration.
