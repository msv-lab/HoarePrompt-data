Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer read from the next line of input, `s` is a string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())` reads an integer from the next line of input and assigns it to the variable `n`.
- The initial state already mentions that `n` is an integer read from the next line of input, so this part remains unchanged.
- The rest of the initial state (`t`, `cases`, `_`, and `s`) remains the same as they are not affected by the code snippet.
