Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(n, s)` and the second tuple is also `(n, s)`, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer read from the next line of input, `s` is a string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `s` is now a new string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is now the integer value read from the next line of input.**
