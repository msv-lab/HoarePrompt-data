Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity of the number of facing-up coins ('U') at the start of the game. The game's rules and the nature of the moves imply that the parity of the number of facing-up coins remains invariant throughout the game. This means that if the number of facing-up coins is initially even, it will remain even; if it is initially odd, it will remain odd.

Given this insight, we can determine the winner based on the initial parity of the number of facing-up coins:
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice (the first player) will win because she can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Bob, and vice versa.
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob (the second player) will win because he can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that the number of facing-up coins remains odd until Alice is forced to lose.

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **func_1**: This function correctly reads the input and constructs the test cases as required. It ensures that the input format is adhered to and prepares the data for further processing. The function returns a list of tuples, each containing the number of coins and the string representation of their states.

2. **func_2**: This function takes a test case and determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string and returns 'YES' if the count is even, and 'NO' if the count is odd. This logic aligns with the reasoning above and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Since both functions work as intended and the logic in `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the initial parity of the number of facing-up coins, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
