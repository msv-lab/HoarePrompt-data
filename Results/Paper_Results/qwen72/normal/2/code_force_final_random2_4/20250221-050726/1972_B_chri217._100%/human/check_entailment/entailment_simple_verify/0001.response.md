### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the number of coins `n` and the string `s` for each test case.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`.
   - The function correctly handles the input format as specified in the problem description.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and each `(n, s)` in `cases` is a tuple where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only 'U' and 'D'. This matches the expected input format.

2. **Game Logic (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` takes a tuple `case` as input, where `case[0]` is the number of coins and `case[1]` is the string representing the state of the coins.
   - It counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s`.
   - It returns `'YES'` if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and `'NO'` if it is even.
   - **Key Insight:** The game's outcome indeed depends on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Each move changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, the player whose turn it is can always make a move, ensuring they can force a win. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, the player whose turn it is will eventually be unable to make a move and will lose.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that `case[0]` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `case[1]` is a string of length `case[0]` containing only 'U' and 'D'. The function correctly counts the number of 'U' characters and returns the appropriate result based on the parity.

3. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The solution correctly identifies the winning condition based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The implementation is straightforward and matches the problem's requirements.
   - **Test Cases:** The provided test cases in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. For example:
     - For the input `5 UUDUD`, the number of 'U' coins is 3 (odd), so the output is `'YES'`.
     - For the input `5 UDDUD`, the number of 'U' coins is 2 (even), so the output is `'NO'`.
     - For the input `2 UU`, the number of 'U' coins is 2 (even), so the output is `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.

Final: **True**
