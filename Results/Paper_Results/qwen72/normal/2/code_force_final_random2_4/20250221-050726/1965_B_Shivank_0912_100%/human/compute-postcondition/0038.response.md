The value `1 << j` is appended to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 19, the value `1 << 19` (which is 524288) is added to the end of the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `tc` is 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `j` is 19, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least \( 2^i \), `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288]`, and `j` is not equal to `i`.**
