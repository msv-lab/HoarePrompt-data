Let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `ans` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is at least 2.
   - `tc` is 2.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\).
   - `j` is 19.
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `k` is the second input integer.
   - The list `ans` is constructed as follows:
     - It starts with the elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
     - It then includes the powers of 2 from `1 << 1` to `1 << 19`.
     - Finally, it includes all powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, except for `1 << i`.

2. **Constructing the List `ans`:**
   - The initial elements are `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. This adds 3 elements to the list.
   - The powers of 2 from `1 << 1` to `1 << 19` add 19 elements to the list.
   - The powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` add 20 elements to the list, but we exclude `1 << i`, so this adds 19 elements to the list.

3. **Total Number of Elements in `ans`:**
   - Initial elements: 3
   - Powers of 2 from `1 << 1` to `1 << 19`: 19
   - Powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` (excluding `1 << i`): 19

   Therefore, the total number of elements in `ans` is:
   \[
   3 + 19 + 19 = 41
   \]

4. **Output:**
   The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the list `ans`, which is 41.

Output: **41**
