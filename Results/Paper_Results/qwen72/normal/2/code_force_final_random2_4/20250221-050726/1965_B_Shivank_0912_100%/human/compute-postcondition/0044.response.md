The value `1 << j` is calculated and appended to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 20, `1 << j` equals \( 2^{20} \), which is 1048576. Therefore, the list `ans` will have this value appended to it.

If `j` is not equal to `i`, the initial `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288, 1048576]`, and after appending `1048576`, it becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288, 1048576, 1048576]`.

If `j` is equal to `i`, the initial `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1048576]`, and after appending `1048576`, it becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1048576, 1048576]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `j` is 20, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least \( 2^i \). If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288, 1048576, 1048576]`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1048576, 1048576]`.**
