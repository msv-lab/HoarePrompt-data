The code snippet `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given the initial conditions, let's determine the output state:

- `t` must be at least 1 (unchanged).
- `tc` is 0 (unchanged).
- `n` and `k` are input integers (unchanged).
- `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \) (unchanged).
- `j` is 1 (unchanged).

Depending on whether `j` is equal to `i` or not, the initial state of `ans` is different:
- If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`.
- If `j` is equal to `i`, `ans` is initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.

Since `j` is 1, the value `1 << j` is `1 << 1`, which equals 2.

Thus, the updated `ans` list will be:
- If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`.
- If `j` is equal to `i`, `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `j` is 1, and `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]` if `j` is not equal to `i`, otherwise `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]`.**
