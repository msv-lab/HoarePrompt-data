Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), and `j` is 1. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]`.***
