### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` excluding `k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Approach in the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` using a loop.
   - It constructs the sequence `ans` with three specific elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - It appends all powers of 2 (except `1 << i`) up to `2^19` to the sequence `ans`.

3. **Analysis of the Sequence Construction**:
   - **Avoiding Subsequences Summing to `k`**:
     - The element `k - (1 << i)` is included to ensure that no subsequence can sum to `k`. Since `1 << i` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, `k - (1 << i)` is less than `k` and cannot be combined with other elements to form `k`.
     - The elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are included to ensure that the sequence can form sums greater than `k`, but they do not contribute to forming `k` directly.
   - **Forming Sums in the Range `[1, n]`**:
     - The powers of 2 (excluding `1 << i`) are included to ensure that the sequence can form any sum in the range `[1, n]` except `k`. This is because any number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2.
     - The specific elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` help in forming sums greater than `k` and ensure that the sequence can cover the entire range `[1, n]` except `k`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed to have at most 25 elements, which satisfies the problem's constraint.
   - The sequence avoids forming a subsequence that sums to `k` by carefully choosing the elements.
   - The sequence can form any sum in the range `[1, n]` except `k` due to the inclusion of powers of 2 and the specific elements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements.
