The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This operation updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the user's input.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `tc` is 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `j` is 19, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19` except for `1 << i`.**
