The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit, which is 20, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than 20. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), `j` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, and the list `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by the powers of 2 from `1 << 1` to `1 << 19`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, the list `ans` additionally includes the element `2`.**
