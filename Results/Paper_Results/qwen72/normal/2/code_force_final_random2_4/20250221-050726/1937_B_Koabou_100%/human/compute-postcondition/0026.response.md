Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is now `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is 1, `i` is 1, `y` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
