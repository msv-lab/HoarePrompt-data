Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and a_{11}a_{12}...a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}...a_{2n} are binary strings of length n, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or a concatenated string formed from parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met, or `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, `y` is the last index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was met, or 0 if the condition was never met, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, or the last value of `i` before the loop broke.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:

            break
        
    #State: `t` is either 1 or `x - i + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or a concatenated string formed from parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is at least 1, `y` is 0, `i` is `x - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, or the last value of `i` before the loop broke. If the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` was met during any iteration, `t` is set to `x - i + 1` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `t` remains 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the concatenated string formed from parts of a[0] and a[1] based on the conditions in the loop)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is 1 if the condition a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1] is never met, or x - i + 1 if the condition is met for some i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It then searches for a specific pattern within these strings and constructs a new string `s` based on certain conditions. If a valid pattern is found, it calculates a value `t` based on the positions of the pattern. Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the calculated value `t`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.
