The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop is set to iterate 2 times, as specified by `range(2)`. This means the loop will always execute exactly twice, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or the contents of the `a` list. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

However, if we consider the context provided (the description of `t`, `n`, and the binary strings), we should ensure that the loop can operate within the given constraints. Since the loop itself does not depend on these variables, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is an empty list, `_` is 0 (loop counter)**

Note: The loop counter `_` is implicitly managed by the `range(2)` function and does not need to be explicitly stated in the state, but it is included here for completeness.
