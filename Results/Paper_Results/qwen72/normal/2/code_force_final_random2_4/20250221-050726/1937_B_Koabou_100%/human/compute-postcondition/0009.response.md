Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list `s`, while the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged.
