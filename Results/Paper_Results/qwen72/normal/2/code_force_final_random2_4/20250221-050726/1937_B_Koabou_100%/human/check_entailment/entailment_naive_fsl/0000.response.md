Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. One specific issue is in the logic used to determine the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
0101
0000
```

Expected Output:
```
00000
2
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
01000
1
```

The program fails to correctly identify the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. The issue lies in the logic for determining the point at which the grasshopper should switch rows to achieve the smallest string. The current implementation does not correctly handle cases where the optimal path involves switching rows multiple times to minimize the resulting string.
