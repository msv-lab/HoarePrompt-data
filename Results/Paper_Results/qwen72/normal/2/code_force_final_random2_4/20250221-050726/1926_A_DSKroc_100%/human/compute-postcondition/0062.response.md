Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, and `s` is a new input string with at least 2 characters. If `i` is 'A', `ac` is incremented by 1 and `bc` remains 0. If `i` is not 'A', `ac` remains 0 and `bc` is incremented by 1. After the if-else block, if `ac` is greater than `bc`, the number of 'A' characters in `s` is greater than the number of non-'A' characters. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.***
