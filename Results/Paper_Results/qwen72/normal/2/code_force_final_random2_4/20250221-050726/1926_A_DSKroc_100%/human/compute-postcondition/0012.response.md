The value of `ac` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that if `i` is 'A', `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 0. Otherwise, `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 1. After incrementing `ac` by 1, the new value of `ac` will be 2 if `i` is 'A', and 1 if `i` is not 'A'. The values of `t`, `q`, `s`, and `bc` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `s` is an input string with at least two characters, `i` is the second character of `s`, `ac` is 2 if `i` is 'A' and 1 otherwise, `bc` is 0 if `i` is 'A' and 1 otherwise.**
