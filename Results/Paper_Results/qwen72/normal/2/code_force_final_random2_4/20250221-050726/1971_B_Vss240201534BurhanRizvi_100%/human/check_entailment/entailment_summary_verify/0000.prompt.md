You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of inputs where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each `s`, if the string has a length of 1 or all characters are the same, the function prints 'No'. Otherwise, it generates a shuffled version of `s` (`s2`). If the shuffled version is identical to `s`, it modifies `s2` by moving the first character to the end. The function then prints 'Yes' followed by the modified or shuffled string `s2`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical issue in how it handles the output of "No" and "Yes" responses. Specifically, the program uses `print('No')` instead of `print('NO')` and `print('Yes')` instead of `print('YES')`. According to the problem description, the output should be "NO" and "YES" (in uppercase), but the program outputs these in lowercase, which does not meet the requirements.

Additionally, the program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the string, which could potentially result in the original string being generated again, even though the program attempts to handle this by appending the first character to the end of the rest of the string. However, this approach is not guaranteed to always produce a different string, especially for strings with many repeated characters. For example, if the input string is "aaaab", the program might still generate "aaaab" after shuffling, leading to incorrect output.

To fix these issues, the program should ensure that the output is always in uppercase and that the shuffled string is guaranteed to be different from the original string.
