The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the number 2. The initial state provides several conditions about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Here's a breakdown of the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
- `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` holds true.

However, none of these conditions influence the `print` statement, which simply prints the integer 2.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **2**
