The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then checks if `n` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO". If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES", followed by "1" and the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints "YES", followed by "2" and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value; it only prints the results based on the conditions.
