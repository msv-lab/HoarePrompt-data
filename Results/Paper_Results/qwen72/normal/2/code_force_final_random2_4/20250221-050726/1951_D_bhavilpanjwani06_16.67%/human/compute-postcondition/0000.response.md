The code reads two values from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values, while the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.**
