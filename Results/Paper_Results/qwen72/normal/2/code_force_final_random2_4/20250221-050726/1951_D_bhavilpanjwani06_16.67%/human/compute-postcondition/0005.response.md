Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
- `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
