The function `func_1` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such functions, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
