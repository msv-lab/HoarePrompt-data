To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
```

### Initial State:
- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `left` is 0.
- `cost` is 0.
- `right` is 1.

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **`left <= right`**: 
   - `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, so this condition is already satisfied.

2. **`right < len(s)`**:
   - `right` is 1, and `len(s)` is the length of `sChar`, which is at least 2. Therefore, this condition is also satisfied.

3. **`left < len(s)`**:
   - `left` is 0, and `len(s)` is at least 2. This condition is also satisfied.

Since all the conditions in the `while` loop are already satisfied with the given initial state, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
