Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, but with the characters at indices `left` and `right` swapped, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `cost` is 2, and the character at index `right` in `s` is now '1' while the character at index `left` in `s` is now '0'.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `cost` is 0.
- The code `cost += right - left + 1` updates the value of `cost`.
- `right` is 1 and `left` is 0, so `right - left + 1` evaluates to `1 - 0 + 1`, which is 2.
- Therefore, `cost` is updated to 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
