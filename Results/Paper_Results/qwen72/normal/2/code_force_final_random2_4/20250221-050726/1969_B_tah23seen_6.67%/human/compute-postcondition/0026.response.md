Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, `left` is 2, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, `cost` is 2, and `s[1]` must not be '1'.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
