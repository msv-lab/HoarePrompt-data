Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is 1, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables (`sChar`, `s`, and `right`) remain unchanged.
