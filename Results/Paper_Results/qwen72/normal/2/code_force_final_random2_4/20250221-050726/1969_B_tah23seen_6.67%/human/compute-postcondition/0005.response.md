The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `sChar`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `sChar`. If there are more characters in `sChar`, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second character of `sChar`, and `s` is a list containing the first and second characters of `sChar`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sChar` must have at least 3 characters, and `i` will be the third character of `sChar`.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 3 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the third character of `sChar`, `s` is a list containing the first and second characters of `sChar`.**
