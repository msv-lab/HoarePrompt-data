To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `right < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that `right` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
   - Given that `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), and `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `len(s)` is at least 2.
   - Therefore, `right` must be less than `len(s)` for the loop to execute.

2. **Condition 2: `s[right] != '0'`**
   - This condition ensures that the character at index `right` in `s` is not '0'.
   - Given that `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, this condition will be true if `right` is not `len(s)` and the character at `right` is not '0'.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`right`**: For the loop to execute, `right` must be less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` must not be '0'.
- **`s[right]`**: Since `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, if `right` is not `len(s)`, then `s[right]` should be '0'. However, for the loop to execute, `s[right]` must not be '0'. This implies that `right` must be adjusted to an index where `s[right]` is not '0'.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `right` must be set to an index where `s[right]` is not '0'. If no such index exists, the loop will not execute. However, since the problem states that `sChar` is a binary string with at least one '1' and one '0', there must be at least one index where `s[right]` is not '0'.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `right` points to an index where `s[right]` is not '0'.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\). `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order. `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, and `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found. `right` must be an index where `s[right]` is not '0'.**
