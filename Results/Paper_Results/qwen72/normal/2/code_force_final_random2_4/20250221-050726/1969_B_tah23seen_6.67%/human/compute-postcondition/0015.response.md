Postcondition: ***`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the characters at indices `left` and `right` in `s` are swapped, `left` remains 0, `right` remains 1, `cost` is 2, and the character at index `right` in `s` is now '1' while the character at index `left` in `s` is now '0'. Otherwise, `s`, `left`, `right`, and `cost` remain unchanged.***
