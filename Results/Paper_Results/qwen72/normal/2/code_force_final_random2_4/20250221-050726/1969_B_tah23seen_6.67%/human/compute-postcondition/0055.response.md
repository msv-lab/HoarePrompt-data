Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is an index where a '1' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`, `right` is updated to an index where a '1' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)` plus 2, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `cost` is increased by `right - left + 1`.**
