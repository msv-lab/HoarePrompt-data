Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `s` will contain all the characters from the binary string `sChar` in the same order they appear in `sChar`. The length of `sChar` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
