Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case, reading the binary string `s` for each case. This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function Definition and Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the binary string `s` for each test case. This is also correct.

3. **String Conversion to List**: Inside `func_1`, the binary string `sChar` is converted to a list `s`. This is a valid approach to manipulate individual characters in the string.

4. **Initialization**: The variables `left`, `cost`, and `right` are initialized correctly. `left` starts at 0, `cost` starts at 0, and `right` starts at 1.

5. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop condition `while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s))` ensures that the indices stay within bounds.
   - The condition `if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1'` checks if a swap is needed to move a '0' to the left of a '1'.
   - The swap operation `s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]` is correct and updates the cost accordingly.
   - The inner loops `while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0': right += 1` and `while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1': left += 1` correctly advance the indices to the next positions where a swap might be needed.

6. **Cost Calculation**: The cost is calculated as `right - left + 1` for each swap, which is the length of the substring being shifted.

7. **Return Value**: The function returns the total cost, which is the sum of the costs of all swaps performed.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - For strings like "10", the function correctly calculates the cost of 2.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
