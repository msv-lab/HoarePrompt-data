The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `sChar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `sChar`. If there are more characters in `sChar`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first character of `sChar`, and `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the next character in `sChar`, and `sChar` must still have characters remaining. Since `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, after the first iteration, `sChar` must have at least 1 character left for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is the second character of `sChar`.
- `sChar` must have at least 1 character left.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the second character of `sChar`, `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`**
