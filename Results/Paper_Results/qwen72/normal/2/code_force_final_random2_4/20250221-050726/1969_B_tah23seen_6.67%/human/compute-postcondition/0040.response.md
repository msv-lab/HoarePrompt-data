Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\). The list `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order. The variable `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found. The variable `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found. The loop has incremented `right` until it either points to the first '0' in `s` or reaches the end of the list `s`.**
