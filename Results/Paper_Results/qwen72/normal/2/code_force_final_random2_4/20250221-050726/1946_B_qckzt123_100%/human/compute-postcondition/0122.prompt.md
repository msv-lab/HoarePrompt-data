Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `T` is assigned the value of `t`. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array `a` and the number of operations, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array `a`. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `MOD` is 1000000007.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    s = sum(a)
    t, tmp = 0, 0
    for x in a:
        tmp += x
        if tmp < 0:
            tmp = 0
        t = max(tmp, t)
    ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
    for i in range(k - 1):
        t *= 2
        t %= MOD
        ans += t
        ans %= MOD
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the remainder of `t * (2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `k-2`, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` is `(2^(k-1) * initial_t) % MOD`, and `ans` is the remainder of (`initial_ans` + `sum of (2^j * initial_t) % MOD` for `j` from 1 to `k-1`) divided by `MOD`. The values of `tmp`, `_`, `T`, `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `k-2`, `k` remains the same, `t` is the remainder of `t * (2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
