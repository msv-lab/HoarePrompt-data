The value of `t` is updated to `t * 2`. Given that `t` was initially `2 * t % MOD`, the new value of `t` becomes `(2 * t % MOD) * 2`. This simplifies to `4 * t % MOD`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `t` is `4 * t % MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`**
