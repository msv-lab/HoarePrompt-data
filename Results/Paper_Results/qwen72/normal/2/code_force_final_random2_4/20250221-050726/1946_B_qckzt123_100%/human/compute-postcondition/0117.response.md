The code snippet `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be the remainder when `t` is divided by `MOD`. Given that `t` is already defined as the remainder of `t * 4` divided by `MOD`, applying the modulus operation again does not change the value of `t` because it is already within the range from 0 to `MOD-1`.

Therefore, the value of `t` remains the same, and the values of `i`, `k`, and `ans` are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3, `t` is the remainder of `t * 4` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`**.
