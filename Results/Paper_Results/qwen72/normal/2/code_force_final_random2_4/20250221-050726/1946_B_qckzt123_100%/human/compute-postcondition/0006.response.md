Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is assigned the value of `t` and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now 0, `tmp` is now 0.** 

The initial values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged except for `t` and `tmp`, which are both set to 0.
