Postcondition: ***`t` is the maximum of `0` and the original value of `tmp`. If `tmp` was less than 0, `tmp` is now `0`. `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`. `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line and must have at least two elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`.***
