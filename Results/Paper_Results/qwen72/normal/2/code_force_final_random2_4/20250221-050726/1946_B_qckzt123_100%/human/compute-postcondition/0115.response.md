The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop condition to still hold true, `k` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3, `t` is the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`**
