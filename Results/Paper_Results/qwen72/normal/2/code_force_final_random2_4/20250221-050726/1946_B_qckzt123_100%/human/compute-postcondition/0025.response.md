To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(k - 1):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will execute if `k - 1` is greater than 0. This means `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run at least once.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop and will start at 0.
2. **Variable `k`**: For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 1.

Given these conditions, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `k` is greater than 1 and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in the list `a`, `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the last element processed in the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
