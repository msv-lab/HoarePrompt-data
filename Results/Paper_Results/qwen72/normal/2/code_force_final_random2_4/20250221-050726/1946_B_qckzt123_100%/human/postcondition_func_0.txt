The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of the number of elements `n`, the number of operations `k`, and an array `a` of integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the sum of the array `a` and the maximum subarray sum that is non-negative. This value is then adjusted through a series of operations defined by `k`, and the final result is printed modulo `1000000007`. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without modifying the input parameters.
