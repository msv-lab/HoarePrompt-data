To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `k - 1`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` must be greater than 1.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The condition `i < k - 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `k - 1` must be greater than 1, which means `k` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is `t % MOD`, `tmp` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of `a` that did not drop below zero, `_` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 1**
