The provided Python code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `k` as integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is assigned the value of `t`, and `T` must be greater than 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values read from the input, converted to integers.
- The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is assigned the value of `t` and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input.**
