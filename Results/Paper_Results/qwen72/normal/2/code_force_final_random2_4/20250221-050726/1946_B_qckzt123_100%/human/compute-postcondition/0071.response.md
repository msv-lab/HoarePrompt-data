Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 2, `t` is doubled (or `t` is `2 * t`).** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is multiplied by 2, and the values of `i` and `k` remain as specified in the initial state, with `i` being 1 and `k` needing to be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.
