The value of `ans` is updated to the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `t`) remain unchanged. Since `t` is the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`, and `ans` was previously increased by `t`, the new value of `ans` is the remainder of the previous `ans` value divided by `MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of the previous `ans` value divided by `MOD`.**
