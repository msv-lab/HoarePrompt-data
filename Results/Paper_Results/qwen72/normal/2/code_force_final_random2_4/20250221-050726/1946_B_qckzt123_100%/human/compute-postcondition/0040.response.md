Output State: **`t` is the remainder of `t * (2 ** (k - 1))` divided by `MOD`, `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the last element processed in the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t * ((2 ** (k - 1)) - 1)) % MOD`, `i` is `k - 2`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: After each iteration, `t` is doubled and then taken modulo `MOD`. After `k - 1` iterations, `t` will be `t * (2 ** (k - 1)) % MOD`.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` starts as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. In each iteration, `t` is added to `ans`, and `ans` is taken modulo `MOD`. After `k - 1` iterations, `ans` will be `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t * ((2 ** (k - 1)) - 1)) % MOD`.
- **`i`**: The loop index `i` will be `k - 2` after the last iteration.
- **Other Variables**: The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `tmp` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
