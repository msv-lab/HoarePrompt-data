The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the constant `T`. The loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by `T`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used just to iterate, it does not hold any specific value that needs to be tracked. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the current iteration count (implied by `_`) must be less than `T`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was given as `t` is the remainder of `t * (2`. This suggests an incomplete or truncated statement, but for the purpose of this task, we focus on the loop control variables.

Since the loop is controlled by `T` and the iteration count (implied by `_`), and assuming the loop has not completed its iterations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is the remainder of `t * (2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`**
