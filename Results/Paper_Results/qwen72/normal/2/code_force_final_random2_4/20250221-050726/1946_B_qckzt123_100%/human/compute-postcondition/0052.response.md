Output State: **`t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, `tmp` is either 0 or the first element in the list `a` (if the first element is non-negative), `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line and must have at least one element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the first element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to the maximum value between `tmp` and its initial value (0).
- `tmp` is either 0 or the first element in the list `a` (if the first element is non-negative).
- The other variables (`_`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
