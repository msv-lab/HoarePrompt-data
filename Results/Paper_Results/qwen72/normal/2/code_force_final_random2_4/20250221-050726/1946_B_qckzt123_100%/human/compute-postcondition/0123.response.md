The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, and an array `a`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of operations.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array `a`.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given parameters and the operations specified by `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the number of operations `k`, and an array `a` of integers. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the parameters and the specified number of operations.**
