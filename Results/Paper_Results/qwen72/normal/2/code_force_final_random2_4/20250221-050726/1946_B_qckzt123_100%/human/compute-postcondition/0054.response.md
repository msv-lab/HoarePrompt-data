Output State: **`t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, `tmp` is either 0 or the first element in the list `a` (if the first element is non-negative) plus the second element in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line and must have at least two elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is updated by adding the second element of the list `a` to its current value.
- All other variables remain unchanged or retain their conditions as specified in the initial state.
