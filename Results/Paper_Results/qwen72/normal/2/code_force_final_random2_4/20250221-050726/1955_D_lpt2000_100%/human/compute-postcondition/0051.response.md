Postcondition: ***`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the execution, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` respectively, and both `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one more element each. If `E[out_aa]` > 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.***
