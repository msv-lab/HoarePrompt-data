Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Type Conversion Issue**: The elements of `aa` and `bb` are converted to strings using `[str(i) for i in input().split()]`. This is incorrect because the problem specifies that the elements are integers, and they should be processed as integers, not strings. This conversion will lead to incorrect behavior when comparing elements in the arrays.

2. **Incorrect Window Management**: The logic for managing the sliding window is flawed. Specifically, the way elements are added and removed from the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` is not correctly implemented. The conditions for updating these counters are not accurate, leading to incorrect counts of matching elements.

3. **Incorrect Initial Count**: The initial count of matching elements (`pairs_in_D`) is calculated correctly, but the subsequent updates to this count are not handled properly. The program incorrectly manages the transitions between the sets `D`, `E`, and `C`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        aa = list(map(int, input().split()))
        bb = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        
        # Calculate initial intersection
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        for i in range(m, n):
            in_aa = aa[i]
            out_aa = aa[i - m]
            
            # Remove the outgoing element
            if out_aa in D:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                if D[out_aa] == 0:
                    del D[out_aa]
                pairs_in_D -= 1
            elif out_aa in cnt_aa:
                cnt_aa[out_aa] -= 1
                if cnt_aa[out_aa] == 0:
                    del cnt_aa[out_aa]
            
            # Add the incoming element
            if in_aa in cnt_bb:
                if in_aa in D:
                    D[in_aa] += 1
                else:
                    D[in_aa] = 1
                pairs_in_D += 1
            else:
                if in_aa in cnt_aa:
                    cnt_aa[in_aa] += 1
                else:
                    cnt_aa[in_aa] = 1
            
            # Check if the current window is good
            if pairs_in_D >= k:
                fnd += 1
        
        print(fnd)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the elements are treated as integers, and the sliding window is managed correctly to update the counts of matching elements.
