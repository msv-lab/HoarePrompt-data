The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of these variables are determined by the user input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers with specific constraints. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, while `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `nabors` must be greater than 0.**
