Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the code execution, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. The value of `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1. All other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `E`, `C`) retain their previous values.**
