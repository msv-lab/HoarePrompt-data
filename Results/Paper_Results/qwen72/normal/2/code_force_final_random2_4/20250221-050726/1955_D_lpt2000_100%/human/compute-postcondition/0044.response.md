Postcondition: ***`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the execution, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next pair of elements from `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`, respectively, and both slices must have at least one more element to pair. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, the value of `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.***
