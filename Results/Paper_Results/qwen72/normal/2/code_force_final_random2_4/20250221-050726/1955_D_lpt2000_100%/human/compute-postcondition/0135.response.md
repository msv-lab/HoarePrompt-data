Postcondition: **`nabors` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input, `aa` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input and must have at least `n` elements, `bb` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `m` is less than `n`, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`, and `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0.**
