Output State: **`nabors` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input, `aa` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `bb` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the input.** 

Explanation: The code creates a new list `bb` by splitting the input and converting each element to a string. The values of `nabors`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as the list `aa`, remain unchanged. The new list `bb` is now part of the state.
