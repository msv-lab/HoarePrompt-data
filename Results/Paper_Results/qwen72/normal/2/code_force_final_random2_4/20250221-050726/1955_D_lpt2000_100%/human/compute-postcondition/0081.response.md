Postcondition: ***`D` is updated to contain the intersection (minimum counts) of the elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is updated to contain the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` (i.e., `cnt_aa - D`), `C` is updated to contain the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` (i.e., `cnt_bb - D`), `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `m` is less than `n`, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.***
