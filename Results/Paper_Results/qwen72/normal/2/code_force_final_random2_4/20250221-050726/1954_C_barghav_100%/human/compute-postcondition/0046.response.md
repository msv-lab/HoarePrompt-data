Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is a string representing an integer where \(1 \leq x < 10^{100}\) and consists only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `y` is a string representing an integer where \(1 \leq y < 10^{100}\) and consists only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings.
- `b` must have at least one element.
- `f` is 1.
- `i` is the length of `a` - 1, where `len(a)` is the original length of the input string `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `len(a) - 1`.
   - Since `a` is a list of characters from the input string `x`, `len(a)` is the length of the string `x`.
   - Therefore, `i` is the last index of the list `a`.

2. **Determine the value of `b[i]`:**
   - `b` is a list of characters from the input strings.
   - `b` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is the last index of `a`, so `b[i]` will be the character at the last index of `b`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print the character at the last index of `b` without a newline (`end=''`).

### Conclusion:
The code will print the last character of the list `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the last character of the list b**
