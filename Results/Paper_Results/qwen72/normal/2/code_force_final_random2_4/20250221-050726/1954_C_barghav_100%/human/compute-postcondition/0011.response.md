Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 0, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1.***
