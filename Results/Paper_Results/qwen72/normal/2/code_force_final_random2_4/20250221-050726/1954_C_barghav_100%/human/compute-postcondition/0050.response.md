To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[i], end='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is a string representing an integer where \(1 \leq x < 10^{100}\) and consists only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `y` is a string representing an integer where \(1 \leq y < 10^{100}\) and consists only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings.
- `b` must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements.
- `f` is 1.
- `i` is `len(a) + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Length of `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is a list of characters from the string `x`.
   - `b` is a list of characters from the string `y`.
   - `b` must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements.

2. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is set to `len(a) + 1`.
   - This means `i` is the index just after the last character of `a` in `b`.

3. **Accessing `b[i]`:**
   - Since `b` has at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `b[i]` is a valid index.
   - `b[i]` will be the element at the position `len(a) + 1` in the list `b`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(b[i], end='')` statement will print the character at the position `len(a) + 1` in the list `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[len(a) + 1] (where b is the list of characters from the string y and len(a) is the length of the list a)**
