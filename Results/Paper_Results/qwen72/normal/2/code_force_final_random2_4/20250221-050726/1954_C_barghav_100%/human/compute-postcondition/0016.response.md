Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is not 0, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`, then the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`. Otherwise, the first character of `a` is less than or equal to the first character of `b`.***
