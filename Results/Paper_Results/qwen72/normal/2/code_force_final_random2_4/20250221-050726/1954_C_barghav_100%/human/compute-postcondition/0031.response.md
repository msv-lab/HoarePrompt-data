Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, `i` is 2. If `a[2]` > `b[2]`, then `f` is 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.***
