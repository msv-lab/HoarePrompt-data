Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is a string representing an integer where \(1 \leq x < 10^{100}\) and consists only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `y` is a string representing an integer where \(1 \leq y < 10^{100}\) and consists only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively.
- `f` is 1.
- `i` is the length of `a` - 1, where `len(a)` must be at least 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `len(a) - 1`.
   - Since `a` is a list of characters from the string `x`, `len(a)` is the length of the string `x`.

2. **Determine the value of `a[i]`:**
   - `a[i]` is the character at the last position of the list `a` because `i` is the last index of the list `a`.

3. **What will be printed:**
   - The `print` statement will print the last character of the string `x` without a newline (due to `end=''`).

### Final Output:
Output: **the last character of the string `x`**

This means that the last character of the string `x` will be printed to the console.
