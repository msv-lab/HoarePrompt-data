Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases to process, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship pairs. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. **
