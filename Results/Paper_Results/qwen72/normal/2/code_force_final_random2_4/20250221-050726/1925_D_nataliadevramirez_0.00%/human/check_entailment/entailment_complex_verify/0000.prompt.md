You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are non-negative integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5. `friendships` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers (a, b, f) where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b, and 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9. `result` is the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each friendship tuple (a, b, f) in the `friendships` list. `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, and `a`, `b`, and `f` are the elements at index `m - 1` of the tuple at the last index in the `friendships` list.
    return result % MOD
    #The program returns the result of `result % MOD`, where `result` is the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each friendship tuple (a, b, f) in the `friendships` list, and `MOD` is a constant value not explicitly defined but assumed to be a large integer used for modulo operations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. It processes each friendship tuple `(a, b, f)` in the `friendships` list and computes the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each tuple. The final result is the sum of these computations, taken modulo `MOD`. The function returns this final result. The parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the `friendships` list is not modified.

The loop has executed `t` times, and the final state reflects the results of all `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases to process, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship pairs. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem's requirement to account for the increase in friendship values during subsequent excursions. Specifically, the program calculates the total sum of friendship values as if the friendship values were constant throughout all excursions, which is incorrect.

### Case Analysis:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 1 2
1 2 1
```
- **n = 2**: There are 2 children.
- **m = 1**: There is 1 pair of friends.
- **k = 2**: There are 2 excursions.
- **Friendship**: The pair (1, 2) has an initial friendship value of 1.

### Expected Output:
- For the first excursion, the friendship value of the pair (1, 2) is 1.
- For the second excursion, the friendship value of the pair (1, 2) is 2 (since it was chosen in the first excursion and increased by 1).

Thus, the expected sum of friendship values is \(1 + 2 = 3\).

### Program Output:
The program calculates the total sum as:
\[ 1 \times \left(\frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2}\right) = 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

However, the program does not correctly handle the dynamic increase in friendship values for subsequent excursions. It assumes that the friendship value remains constant throughout all excursions, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the probability of each pair being chosen.
2. Update the friendship values dynamically based on the number of times each pair is chosen.
3. Compute the expected sum of friendship values for all excursions.

The current implementation fails to account for these dynamics, leading to incorrect results for certain test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
