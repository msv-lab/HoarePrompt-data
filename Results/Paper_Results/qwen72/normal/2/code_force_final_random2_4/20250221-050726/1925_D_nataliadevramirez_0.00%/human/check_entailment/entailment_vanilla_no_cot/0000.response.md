Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the formula used in `func_1` to calculate the result is incorrect. The current implementation multiplies the initial friendship value by the sum of the first k natural numbers, which does not account for the probability of selecting each pair and the incremental increase in friendship value over the excursions.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the following:

1. **Probability of Selecting a Pair**: Each pair of children is selected with equal probability, which is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) for any pair of children. For friends, this probability is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value**: For each excursion, if a pair of friends is selected, their friendship value increases by 1. The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair of friends over k excursions is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

3. **Total Expected Value**: The total expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen is the sum of the expected values for each pair of friends, considering their initial friendship value and the expected increase over k excursions.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import comb

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def mod_inverse(x, mod):
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = comb(n, 2)
    result = 0
    for a, b, f in friendships:
        expected_increase = (k * mod_inverse(total_pairs, MOD)) % MOD
        result = (result + (f + expected_increase) * k) % MOD
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

This corrected version calculates the expected value correctly by considering the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in friendship value over the excursions.
