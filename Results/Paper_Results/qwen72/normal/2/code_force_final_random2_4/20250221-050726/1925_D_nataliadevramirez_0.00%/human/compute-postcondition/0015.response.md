To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
   - `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers read from the input.
   - `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is a positive integer, but it is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided as input.
   - `friendships` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing a friendship relationship.
   - `result` is the output of the function `func_1`, which takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as arguments.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact logic or computation it performs.
   - However, the function returns a value, which is stored in `result`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`.

Given the lack of specific details about the function `func_1`, we can only describe the output in general terms based on the information provided.

**Output:**
**result (where result is the value returned by the function func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
