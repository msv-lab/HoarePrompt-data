### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions.
   - Each excursion involves choosing a pair of children randomly.
   - If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The final answer should be the expected sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function calculates the contribution of each friendship to the total expected value.
     - For each friendship `(a, b, f)`, it computes `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
     - The term `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the expected increase in the friendship value over `k` excursions.
     - The function sums these contributions for all friendships and returns the result modulo `MOD`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads `m` lines of friendship data.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Expected Value Calculation**:
     - The formula used in `func_1` correctly calculates the expected increase in the friendship value for each pair over `k` excursions.
     - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is indeed `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
     - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

   - **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
     - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and then handling each test case individually.
     - It correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Both functions work together to handle the input and produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
