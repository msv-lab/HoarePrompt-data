Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, and this remains unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers.
- The variable `friendships` remains a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, as specified in the initial state.
- The variable `result` is still the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`, as no changes have been made to this part of the state.
