The code snippet reads `m` lines of input, each line containing two integers, and stores them as a list of lists in the variable `friendships`. Each inner list represents a friendship between two individuals, identified by the integers.

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as input integers.
- `friendships` is now a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing a friendship.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers.**
