### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summaries step by step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions. The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen again.

#### Program Code:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
       result = 0
       for i in range(m):
           (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
           result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
       return result % MOD
   ```
   - This function iterates over each friendship pair and calculates the contribution of each pair to the total sum of friendship values.
   - The formula used is \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \), which is the sum of the first k natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value \( f \).
   - This formula assumes that the friendship value of each pair increases linearly over the k excursions, which is correct for the given problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   ```python
   def func_2():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
           friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
           result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
           print(result)
   ```
   - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the inputs for each test case and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
- **Function 2 Summary**: The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship pairs. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.

### Evaluation:
1. **Dynamic Increase in Friendship Values**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the dynamic increase in friendship values during subsequent excursions.
   - However, the formula \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \) used in `func_1` correctly accounts for the linear increase in friendship values over the k excursions. This formula sums the friendship values from 1 to k for each pair, which is the correct approach.

2. **Expected Output**:
   - For the test case:
     ```
     1
     2 1 2
     1 2 1
     ```
     - The initial friendship value is 1.
     - For the first excursion, the friendship value is 1.
     - For the second excursion, the friendship value is 2.
     - The expected sum of friendship values is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).
   - The program correctly calculates this as:
     \[
     1 \times \left(\frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2}\right) = 1 \times 3 = 3
     \]

3. **General Case**:
   - The formula \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \) is mathematically sound and correctly handles the dynamic increase in friendship values for any number of excursions \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles the dynamic increase in friendship values and computes the expected sum of friendship values for all excursions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
