The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop variable itself is not used within the loop body. The loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by the value of `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, and the loop variable `_` will be incremented by 1 (though this increment is implicit and not stored in a variable).

Since the loop variable `_` is not used, and the only condition for the loop to continue is that `t` must be greater than 0, the state of `t` does not change in terms of its condition (it must remain greater than 0). However, the loop counter (which is not explicitly named but is implied by the range) is incremented.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
