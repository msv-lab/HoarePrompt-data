Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions. The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen again.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides the number of children (n), pairs of friends (m), and excursions (k).
   - For each pair of friends, the indices of the children and their initial friendship value are given.
   - The output should be the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (func_1)**:
     - This function calculates the expected value for a single test case.
     - It iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution of each friendship to the total expected value.
     - The formula used is \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \mod MOD \), which is the sum of the first k natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value.
     - This formula assumes that each pair of friends is chosen with equal probability and their friendship value increases linearly with each excursion.
   - **Function 2 (func_2)**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
     - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \mod MOD \) correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for a single pair of friends over k excursions.
   - The function `func_1` correctly sums up the contributions of all pairs of friends.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When there are no pairs of friends (m = 0), the expected value is 0, which is correctly handled by the formula.
   - The constraints are respected, and the code should handle large inputs efficiently.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
