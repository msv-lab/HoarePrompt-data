To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `new_median <= median`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `num` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`
- `num2` is less than or equal to 10000
- `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd
- `new_median` is equal to `median`

The only variables in the loop head are `new_median` and `median`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `new_median <= median` must be true.

Since `new_median` is initially equal to `median`, the condition `new_median <= median` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `new_median` is equal to `median`**
