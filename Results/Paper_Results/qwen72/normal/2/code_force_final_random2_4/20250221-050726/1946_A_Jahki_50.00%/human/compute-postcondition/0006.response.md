The given `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides various conditions and values for different variables, but none of these affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same value regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, or `op`.

Output: **1**
