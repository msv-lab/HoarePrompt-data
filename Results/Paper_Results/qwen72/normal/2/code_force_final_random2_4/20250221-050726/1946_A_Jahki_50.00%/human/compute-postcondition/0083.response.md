To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `new_median <= median`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.
- Given the state before the loop, `new_median` is set to the value of `b[ma]`, and `median` is also set to the value of `b[ma]`.

Since both `new_median` and `median` are initially set to the same value (`b[ma]`), the condition `new_median <= median` is already true. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

### Conclusion:
No changes are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of integers extracted from the digit strings in `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]`**
