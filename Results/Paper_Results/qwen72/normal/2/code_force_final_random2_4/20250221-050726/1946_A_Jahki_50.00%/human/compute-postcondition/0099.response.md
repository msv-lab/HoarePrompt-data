Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop continues until `new_median` is greater than `median`.
- After all iterations, `op` will be equal to the number of times the loop executed, which is the minimum number of increments required to make `new_median` greater than `median`.
- The value of `b[ma]` will be `median + 1`.
- `new_median` will be `median + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `b`, `ma`) will retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.

Given this information, the `print(op)` statement will print the value of `op`, which is the number of times the loop executed to make `new_median` greater than `median`.

Output: **op (where op is the minimum number of increments required to make new_median greater than median)**
