Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the array and the array itself.

2. **Median Calculation**: The function correctly identifies the median position based on whether the length of the array is odd or even. However, there is a logical issue in the way the median is updated and checked.

3. **Operation Counting**: The function attempts to increment the median value until it is greater than the current median. This is done by repeatedly incrementing the element at the median position and re-sorting the array. This approach is inefficient and can lead to unnecessary operations.

4. **Early Termination**: The function has a condition to terminate early if the length of the array exceeds 10000. This is not part of the problem statement and seems to be an arbitrary check that could lead to incorrect results for valid inputs.

5. **Output**: The function prints the number of operations required for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

However, the early termination and the inefficient method of updating the median are significant issues that need to be addressed. The early termination condition should be removed, and the median update logic should be optimized.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
