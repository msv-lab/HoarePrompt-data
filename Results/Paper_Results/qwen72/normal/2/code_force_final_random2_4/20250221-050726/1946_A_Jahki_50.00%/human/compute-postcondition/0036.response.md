Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, and `op` is 0. If `num2` is greater than 10000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `op` is the number of iterations required to make `new_median` greater than `median`, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]` which is now greater than `median`, and `b[ma]` is `median + (number of iterations - 1)`.**
