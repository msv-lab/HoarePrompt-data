Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000. If `num2` is even, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. If `num2` is odd, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`.**
