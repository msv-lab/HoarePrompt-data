To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`.
   - The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `num` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `num2` is an input integer.
   - `case` is an input string.
   - `op` is the number of iterations required to make `new_median` greater than `median`.
   - `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`.
   - `num2` is less than or equal to 10000.
   - `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd.
   - `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]` which is now greater than `median`.
   - `b[ma]` is `median + (number of iterations - 1)`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`.
   - `median` is the median of the list `b`.
   - `new_median` is the new median after some number of iterations.
   - `op` is the number of iterations required to make `new_median` greater than `median`.

3. **Logic Explanation:**
   - The median of a sorted list `b` is determined by the middle element(s) of the list.
   - If `num2` is even, `median` is the average of the two middle elements.
   - If `num2` is odd, `median` is the middle element.
   - `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after some number of iterations, and it is described as `median + (number of iterations - 1)`.
   - Therefore, `op` is the number of iterations required to make `new_median` greater than `median`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `new_median` is `median + (number of iterations - 1)`, the number of iterations required to make `new_median` greater than `median` is 1 (because `new_median` becomes `median + 1` after one iteration).

Therefore, the value of `op` is 1.

Output: **1**
