Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `num2` is odd, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)` which is an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ma = int(num2 / 2)` calculates the integer division of `num2` by 2 and assigns the result to `ma`. Since `num2` is an odd integer and less than or equal to 10000, `ma` will be an integer representing half of `num2`, rounded down to the nearest whole number. All other variables remain unchanged.
