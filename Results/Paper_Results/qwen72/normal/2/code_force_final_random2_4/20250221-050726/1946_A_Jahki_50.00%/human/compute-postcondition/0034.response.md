Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is the number of iterations required to make `new_median` greater than `median`, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]` which is now greater than `median`, `b[ma]` is `median + (number of iterations - 1)`.**

In natural language, the loop continues to increment the value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` until the new median (`new_median`) becomes greater than the original median (`median`). The variable `op` keeps track of the number of iterations it took to achieve this. After the loop completes, `b[ma]` will be `median + (number of iterations - 1)`, and `new_median` will be greater than `median`. All other variables remain unchanged.
