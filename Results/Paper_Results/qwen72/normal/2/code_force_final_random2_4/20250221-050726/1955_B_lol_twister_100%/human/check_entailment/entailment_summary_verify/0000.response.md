### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to verify if the given list `l` can form a progressive square with the specified `n`, `c`, and `d`.
- The progressive square is constructed such that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is given by \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)c + (j-1)d \).
- The key is to determine if the elements in `l` can be rearranged to form such a matrix.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
- The function `func_1` starts by finding the minimum value in the list `l` and assumes this minimum value is \( a_{1,1} \).
- It then generates a new list `li` containing all possible values of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) for \( k \) and \( h \) ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \).
- Both `l` and `li` are sorted, and the function checks if they are equal.
- If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it assumes the minimum value in `l` is \( a_{1,1} \), which may not always be true.
- The provided counterexample demonstrates a case where the minimum value in `l` is not \( a_{1,1} \), leading to an incorrect result.

#### Verification:
- Let's verify the counterexample provided in the original assessment:
  - Input: \( n = 3 \), \( c = 2 \), \( d = 3 \), \( l = [1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25] \)
  - The minimum value in `l` is 1.
  - The function generates the list `li` as:
    - \( 1 + 0 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 3 = 1 \)
    - \( 1 + 0 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 3 = 4 \)
    - \( 1 + 0 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 = 7 \)
    - \( 1 + 1 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 3 = 3 \)
    - \( 1 + 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 3 = 6 \)
    - \( 1 + 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 = 9 \)
    - \( 1 + 2 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 3 = 5 \)
    - \( 1 + 2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 3 = 8 \)
    - \( 1 + 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 = 11 \)
  - Sorted `li`: \( [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11] \)
  - Sorted `l`: \( [1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25] \)
  - Clearly, `li` does not match `l`, so the function returns 'no'.

#### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is correct. The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum value in `l` is \( a_{1,1} \), which can lead to incorrect results.
- The provided counterexample effectively demonstrates this issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
