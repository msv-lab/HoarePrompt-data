Reasoning:

The program aims to verify whether a given list of numbers can form a progressive square based on the rules provided. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Function Call**: For each test case, the function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters (`n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`).

3. **Finding the Minimum Value**: Inside `func_1`, the minimum value `a` in the list `l` is determined. This is correct because the progressive square is built starting from the smallest element.

4. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates a list `li` that represents the elements of the progressive square. This is done using nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns, calculating each element as `a + k * c + d * h`. This correctly follows the rule for constructing the progressive square.

5. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both `li` and `l` are sorted, and then they are compared. If they match, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'. Sorting is necessary because the elements in `l` are given in random order, and we need to check if they can be rearranged to match the progressive square.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result of the function call for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is at its minimum (2) or maximum (500), and when `c` and `d` are at their limits (1 and 10^6). The current implementation seems to handle these cases correctly.
- **Performance**: The program has a time complexity of O(n^2 log n) due to the sorting step. Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list of numbers can form a progressive square based on the rules provided. The steps are logically sound and the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
