The only objects in the loop head are the variable `h` and the range defined by `n`. The loop can execute again if `h` is within the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing two elements `[a, a + d]`, `k` is 0, `h` is 2**
