Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `tc` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mexsize`**:
   - `mexsize` is defined as the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize` that is not in the list `a`.

2. **Parity of `mexsize`**:
   - We need to determine whether `mexsize` is even or odd.
   - Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in the list and it is greater than `maxsize`, it must be the next integer after the largest number in the list.
   - If `maxsize` is even, then `mexsize` will be `maxsize + 1`, which is odd.
   - If `maxsize` is odd, then `mexsize` will be `maxsize + 1`, which is even.

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - The print statement checks if `mexsize % 2 == 0` (i.e., if `mexsize` is even).
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Bob'.

### Conclusion:
- Since `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize`, and `maxsize` can be either even or odd, `mexsize` will be odd if `maxsize` is even, and `mexsize` will be even if `maxsize` is odd.
- Therefore, the print statement will print 'Alice' if `mexsize` is even, and 'Bob' if `mexsize` is odd.

Given that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, and without knowing the exact value of `maxsize`, we can only conclude that `mexsize` will be the next integer after `maxsize`.

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is even, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and is greater than `maxsize`)**.
