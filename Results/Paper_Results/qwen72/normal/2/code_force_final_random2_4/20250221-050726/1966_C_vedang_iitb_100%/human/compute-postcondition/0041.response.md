To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `tc` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

2. **Key Points:**
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the largest integer in the list.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in the list `a`, and it is given that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

3. **Condition in the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `mexsize % 2 == 0` (i.e., if `mexsize` is even).
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Bob'.

4. **Determine the Parity of `mexsize`:**
   - Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in the list `a` and it is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` must be the next integer after `maxsize`.
   - For example, if `maxsize` is 5, then `mexsize` would be 6 (the next integer after 5).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize`, and `maxsize` is an integer, `mexsize` will always be an even number because it is the next integer after the largest integer in the list.
   - Therefore, `mexsize % 2 == 0` will always be true.

Based on this analysis, the `print` statement will always print 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
