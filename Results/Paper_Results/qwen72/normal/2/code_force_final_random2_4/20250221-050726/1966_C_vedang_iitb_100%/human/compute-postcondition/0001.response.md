To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `tc` and `t`.

- `t` is the number of test cases, and it is given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.
- `tc` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `tc` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting point of the iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and `tc` is 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
