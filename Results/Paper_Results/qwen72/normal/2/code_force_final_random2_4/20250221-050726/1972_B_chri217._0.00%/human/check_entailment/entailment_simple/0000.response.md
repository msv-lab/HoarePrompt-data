### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The key observation is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`U`) determines the winner.
   - If the number of `U` coins is odd, Alice will always have a move when it's her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no moves left.
   - If the number of `U` coins is even, Bob will always have a move when it's his turn, and he can force Alice into a position where she has no moves left.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it counts the number of `U` coins using `s.count('U')`.
   - It then checks the parity of this count:
     - If the count is odd, it returns 'YES' (Alice wins).
     - If the count is even, it returns 'NO' (Bob wins).

3. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(s)` for each test case, which is either 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The input handling and output are also correct.

### Correctness:
