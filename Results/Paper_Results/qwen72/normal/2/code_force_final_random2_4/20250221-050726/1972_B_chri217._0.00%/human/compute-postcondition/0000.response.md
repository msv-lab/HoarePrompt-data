The code snippet `num_up = s.count('U')` counts the occurrences of the character 'U' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `num_up`. The length of `s` remains `n`, and `s` still contains only the characters "U" and "D".

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) containing only "U" and "D", `num_up` is the number of "U" characters in `s`.**
