Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**:
   - The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The key observation is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have the last move and win. If it is even, Bob will have the last move and win.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the string `s` to determine the winner.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' (facing-up coins) in the string `s`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it returns 'YES' (Alice wins), otherwise, it returns 'NO' (Bob wins).

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the input data.
   - The indices for `n` and `s` are correctly used in the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when there are no facing-up coins (returns 'NO') and when there is only one facing-up coin (returns 'YES').

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

Correctness: **True**
