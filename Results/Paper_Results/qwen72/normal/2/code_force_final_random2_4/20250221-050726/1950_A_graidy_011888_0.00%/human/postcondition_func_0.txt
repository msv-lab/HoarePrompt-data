The function `func` generates 1000 sets of three random integers (`x`, `y`, `z`) between 1 and 9 (inclusive). For each set, it determines a string result (`res`) based on the relationships between these integers: if `x` is less than `y` and `y` is greater than `z`, `res` is 'peak'; if `x` is less than `y` and `y` is less than `z`, `res` is 'stair'; otherwise, `res` is 'none'. The function prints each set of integers followed by the corresponding `res`. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value.
