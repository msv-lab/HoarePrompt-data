You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Annotated Code: 
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all 1000 iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `i` is 1001, `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) for each iteration. For each iteration, if `x` < `y` and `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `x` < `y` and `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'. If `x` < `y` and `y` == `z`, `res` is 'none'. If `x` >= `y`, `res` is 'none'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not read the input as specified in the problem description. It should read the number of test cases `t` and then process each test case individually. Instead, it generates random numbers using `randint`.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints the generated random numbers and the result, but it does not follow the required output format. It should print "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `x == y` or `y == z`.
   - The program incorrectly classifies cases where `x >= y` as "none" without considering other possibilities.
   - The program does not handle the case where `x == y == z`.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
def solve(a, b, c):
    if a < b < c:
        return "STAIR"
    elif a < b > c:
        return "PEAK"
    else:
        return "NONE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        results.append(solve(a, b, c))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version reads the input as specified, processes each test case, and outputs the correct result for each case.
