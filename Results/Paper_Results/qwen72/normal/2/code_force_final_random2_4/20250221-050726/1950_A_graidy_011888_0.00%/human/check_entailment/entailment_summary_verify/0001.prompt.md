You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` generates 1000 sets of three random integers (`x`, `y`, `z`) between 1 and 9 (inclusive). For each set, it determines a string result (`res`) based on the relationships between these integers: if `x` is less than `y` and `y` is greater than `z`, `res` is 'peak'; if `x` is less than `y` and `y` is less than `z`, `res` is 'stair'; otherwise, `res` is 'none'. The function prints each set of integers followed by the corresponding `res`. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The provided program does not read input from the user or standard input, which is required according to the problem statement. The problem specifies that the program should handle multiple test cases, but the given program generates random test cases instead of reading them from input.

2. **Test Case Generation**: The program uses `randint` to generate random digits for each test case. This is not aligned with the problem's requirement to process a fixed set of test cases provided as input.

3. **Logic for Stair and Peak**: The logic inside the `if` statements correctly identifies whether the digits form a stair or a peak:
   - If `x < y` and `y > z`, it correctly identifies a peak.
   - If `x < y` and `y < z`, it correctly identifies a stair.
   - If `x < y` and `y == z`, it correctly identifies none.
   - If `x >= y`, it correctly identifies none.

4. **Output**: The program prints the generated random digits and the result for each test case, but it does not follow the format specified in the problem statement. The problem requires the program to output "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case, without printing the test case digits.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement because it does not read input and does not produce the correct output format.
