Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `i` is 5, `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `res` is determined based on the conditions: if `x` < `y` and `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'; if `x` < `y` and `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'; if `x` < `y` and `y` == `z`, `res` is 'none'; if `x` >= `y`, `res` is 'none'.**
