Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It iterates over each test case, reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and determines the optimal value of `k` to maximize the profit. The key points to consider are:

1. **Choosing `k`**: The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is correct because `k` should not exceed the number of buns `n` or the difference between the promotional price `b` and the usual price `a`.

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it's better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`, so the profit is `a * n`.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, the profit is calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. This formula accounts for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, plus the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `b` is less than or equal to `a` and when `n` is very large (up to \(10^9\)).

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to handle all cases correctly and efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
