Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun). For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost for buying `n` buns. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the total cost is `a * n`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the total cost is calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
