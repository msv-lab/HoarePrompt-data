Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the maximum profit from selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the fixed price `a`.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

3. **Choosing `k`**: The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This choice is based on the idea that if `b` is greater than `a`, it is beneficial to use the promotional pricing for as many buns as possible, up to the point where the promotional price is still higher than the regular price `a`. This is correct because selling buns at a price higher than `a` maximizes profit.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the promotional price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the regular price `a`. The profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as the sum of the promotional prices for the first `k` buns plus the regular price for the remaining `n - k` buns. The formula used is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - `b * k` is the total price if all `k` buns were sold at `b`.
     - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts for the decreasing price, which forms an arithmetic series. This is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the correct adjustment for the decreasing prices.
     - `(n - k) * a` is the profit from the remaining buns sold at the regular price.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `b <= a` correctly by selling all buns at the regular price.
   - The program also handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the constraints (up to \(10^9\)). The arithmetic operations and the formula used ensure that the calculations are efficient and correct for these large values.

6. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
