Based on the initial state:

- `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer, and it is given that `b` is less than or equal to `a`.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement calculates the product of `a` and `n`.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- The value of `k` (which is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`) is not directly relevant to the calculation in the `print` statement.

### Calculation:
- The expression `a * n` multiplies the value of `a` by the value of `n`.

### Output:
Output: **a * n (where a is the input integer and n is the input integer greater than 0)**
