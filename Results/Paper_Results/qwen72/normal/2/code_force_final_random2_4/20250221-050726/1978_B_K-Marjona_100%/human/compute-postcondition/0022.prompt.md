You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the total cost for the buns is `a * n`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the total cost for the buns is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. The loop variable `_` is now equal to `t - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun). It returns the total cost for buying `n` buns, where the first bun is sold at price `b` and the remaining `n-1` buns are sold at price `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
