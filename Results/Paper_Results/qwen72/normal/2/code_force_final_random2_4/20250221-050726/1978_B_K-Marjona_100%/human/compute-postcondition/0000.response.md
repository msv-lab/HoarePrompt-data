The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be at least 1. The other variables (t, n, a, b) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop's execution condition.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
