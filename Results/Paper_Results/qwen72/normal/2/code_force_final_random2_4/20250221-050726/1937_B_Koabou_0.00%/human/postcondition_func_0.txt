The function reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the input. It then processes these strings to form a new string `s` and an integer `t`. The string `s` is constructed by finding the first position where the next character in the first string is '1' and the current character in the second string is '0', and concatenating the prefix of the first string up to this position with the suffix of the second string starting from this position. If no such position is found, `s` is formed by concatenating the entire first string with the last character of the second string. The integer `t` is determined by checking the longest prefix of the first string that matches the corresponding prefix of `s`; if a match is found, `t` is set to the difference between the position where the condition was met and the current index, otherwise, `t` remains 1. The function prints the string `s` and the integer `t`.
