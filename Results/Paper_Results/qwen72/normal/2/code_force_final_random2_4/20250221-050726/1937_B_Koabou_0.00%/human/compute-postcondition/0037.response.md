Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is a string formed based on certain conditions, `x` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` match the first `i + 1` characters of `s`, then `t` is updated to `x`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
