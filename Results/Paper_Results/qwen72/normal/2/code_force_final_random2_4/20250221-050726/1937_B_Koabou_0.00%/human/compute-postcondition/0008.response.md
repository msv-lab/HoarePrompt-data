Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, the loop has completed its execution.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly twice, as specified by the `range(2)` in the loop header.
- After the first iteration, `a` contains one input string.
- After the second iteration, `a` contains two input strings.
- Since the loop runs exactly twice, after both iterations are complete, `a` will contain exactly two input strings.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
