Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is a string formed based on certain conditions, `x` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, then `t` is updated to `x - 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without changing `t`.***
