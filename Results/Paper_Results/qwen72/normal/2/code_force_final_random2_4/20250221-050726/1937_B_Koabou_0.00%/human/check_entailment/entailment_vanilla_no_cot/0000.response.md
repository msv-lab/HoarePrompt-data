Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Path Calculation**: The logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The program attempts to find a point where it should switch from the top row to the bottom row, but it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, it may miss cases where switching earlier would result in a lexicographically smaller string.

2. **Path Count Calculation**: The method for counting the number of paths that yield the smallest string is also incorrect. The variable `t` is used to count the number of paths, but the logic for updating `t` is not correct and does not account for all possible paths that could lead to the same string.

3. **Output Formatting**: The `print(s, sep='')` statement is unnecessary and incorrect. The `sep` parameter is used to specify the separator between items when printing multiple items, but here `s` is a single string. Simply using `print(s)` would suffice.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the grid is entirely composed of zeros or when the optimal path involves staying in the top row until the last column.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Determine the lexicographically smallest string by comparing the top and bottom rows at each step.
- Count the number of paths that yield this string by keeping track of the number of ways to reach each cell in the grid.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = [input() for _ in range(2)]
    
    # Initialize the smallest string and the number of paths
    s = a[0][0]
    paths = 1
    
    # Iterate through the columns
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[0][i] < a[1][i-1]:
            s += a[0][i]
        else:
            s += a[1][i-1]
            paths = 1 if a[0][i] != a[1][i-1] else paths + 1
    
    # Add the last character of the bottom row
    s += a[1][-1]
    
    print(s)
    print(paths)

# Read the number of test cases
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the lexicographically smallest string is found and the number of paths that yield this string is correctly counted.
