Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the string formed by concatenating the substring of `a[0]` up to the position where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met with the rest of `a[1]`, or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` if the condition is never met, `x` is the index where the condition is met or `n-1` if the condition is never met.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is explicitly set to 1.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
