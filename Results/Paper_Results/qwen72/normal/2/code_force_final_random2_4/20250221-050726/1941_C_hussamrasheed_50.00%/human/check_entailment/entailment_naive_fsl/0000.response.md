Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only counts and removes occurrences of the exact substrings "map" and "pie" but does not account for overlapping occurrences or partial matches that could still result in an ugly string after removal.

For example, consider the input string "mappie". The program will count one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie", and it will output 2. However, the correct answer should be 3 because the string "mappie" can be made beautiful by removing 3 characters (for example, removing the 'a' and both 'p's, resulting in "mie").

This shows that the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
