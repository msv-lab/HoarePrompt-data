The code `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. This impacts the value of `s` and also changes the count of 'map' appearances in `s`, which is stored in `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is now 0, `p` remains the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated `s`.**
