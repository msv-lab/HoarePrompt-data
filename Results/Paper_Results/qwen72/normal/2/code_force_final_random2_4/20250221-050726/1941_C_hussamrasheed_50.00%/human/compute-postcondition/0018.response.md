Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code `m = s.count('map')` updates the value of `m` to the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `p`) remain unchanged. The new value of `m` is now the count of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
