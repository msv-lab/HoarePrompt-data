Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
   - `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.
   - `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(m + p)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `m` represents the count of the substring 'map' in the original string `s`.
   - The variable `p` represents the count of the substring 'pie' in the modified string `s` after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed.
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `m` and `p`.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the sum of the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string `s` and the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **m + p (where m is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string s, and p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string s)**
