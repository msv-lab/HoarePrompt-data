Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(m + p)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `m` is explicitly set to 0.
   - `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated string `s`.
   - The updated string `s` is the original input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `m` and `p`.

4. **Determine the Value of `p`:**
   - Since `m` is 0, the output will simply be the value of `p`.
   - `p` is the count of the substring 'pie' in the updated string `s`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated string `s`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **p (where p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated string s after removing all occurrences of 'map')**
