The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
