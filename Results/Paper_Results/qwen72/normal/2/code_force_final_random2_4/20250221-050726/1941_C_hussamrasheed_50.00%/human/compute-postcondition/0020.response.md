Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is 0, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated `s`.**

Explanation: The code `p = s.count('pie')` updates the variable `p` to the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
