Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the string `s2`. Here, `s1` contains all characters from `s` that were present in `alphabet` before being removed, and `s2` contains all characters from `s` that were added when `alphabet` had only one element left. `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.**
