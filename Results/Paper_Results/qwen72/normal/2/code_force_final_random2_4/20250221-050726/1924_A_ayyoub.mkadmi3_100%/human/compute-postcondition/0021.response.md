The code `alphabet.remove(i)` removes the third character of the string `s` from the list `alphabet`. Since `i` is the third character of `s`, and `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, the character `i` is removed from the list `alphabet`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is the third character of `s`, and `i` has been removed from the list `alphabet`.**
