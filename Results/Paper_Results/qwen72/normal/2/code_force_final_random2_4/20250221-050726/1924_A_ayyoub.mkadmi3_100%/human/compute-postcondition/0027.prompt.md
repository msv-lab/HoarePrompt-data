Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6, s1 is an empty string, s2 is an empty string, alphabet is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is the first character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `s2` is an empty string if the size of `alphabet` is not 1; otherwise, `s2` contains the first character of `s`. The size of `alphabet` is `k-1` if it was not 1, otherwise it remains 1. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, and `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`. `s2` is an empty string if the size of `alphabet` is not 1; otherwise, `s2` contains the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, `alphabet` is updated to exclude `i`, and the size of `alphabet` is now `k-2` if `k-1` was not 1. If `len(alphabet) == 1`, the size of `alphabet` remains 1. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, and `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is now the original value of `s1` plus the third character of `s`, and if the length of `alphabet` is not 1, `i` has been removed from the list `alphabet`. Otherwise, `s2` is now the original value of `s2` plus the third character of `s`, and `alphabet` remains a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the program does nothing additional.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
