Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are a few specific cases where the program fails:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**: The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this. It only checks if the length of the processed string `s1` is at least `n * k`, which is not sufficient to ensure that all possible subsequences are present.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: When the program determines that not all subsequences are present, it attempts to generate a missing subsequence. However, the logic used to generate this missing subsequence is flawed. It simply appends a character that is not in `s1` to the end of `s2`, which may not always produce a valid missing subsequence.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if `k` is 1, the only possible string of length `n` is a string of repeated characters. The current implementation does not correctly handle this case.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
The correct output should be:
```
NO
aa
```
However, the provided program will output:
```
No
bb
```
This is incorrect because the string "aa" is a valid string of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence in "abb".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the problem as described and fails in multiple scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
