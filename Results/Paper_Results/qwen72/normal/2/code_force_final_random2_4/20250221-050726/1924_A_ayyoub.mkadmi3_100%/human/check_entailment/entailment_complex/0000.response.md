### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes an output list `OUT` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Function Call and Result Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with `s`, `k`, and `n` as arguments.
   - The function returns a tuple `(b, s1, s2)` where:
     - `b` is a boolean indicating whether all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
     - `s1` is a substring of `s` after processing.
     - `s2` is a string containing characters that were added when the `alphabet` set had only one element left.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - If `b` is `False`, the program appends "No" to `OUT` and generates a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s` by appending the missing character `chr(i)` to `s2`.
   - If `b` is `True`, the program appends "Yes" to `OUT`.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and `alphabet` as a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in `s`:
     - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it is added to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` has more than one element, `i` is removed from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` has only one element, `i` is added to `s2` and `alphabet` is reset.
   - The function calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

5. **Correctness of the Function:**
   - The function correctly processes the string `s` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The logic for generating the missing string in the case of `b` being `False` is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input, processes the string `s` to check for subsequences, and generates the required output.

**Correctness: **True****
