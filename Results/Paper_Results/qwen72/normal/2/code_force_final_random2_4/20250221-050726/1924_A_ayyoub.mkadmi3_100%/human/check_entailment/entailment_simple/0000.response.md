### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide an example of such a string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with `s`, `k`, and `n` as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` to determine if all required subsequences are present.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `s1` and `s2` are initialized as empty strings.
   - `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The loop iterates through each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it is added to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` has more than one element, the character is removed from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` has only one element, the character is added to `s2` and `alphabet` is reset.
   - After the loop, `r` is calculated as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - The function returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, it means not all required subsequences are present.
   - It constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence by appending the missing character (if any) to `s2`.
   - If the boolean is `True`, it prints "Yes".
   - Finally, it prints all results stored in `OUT`.

5. **Issues and Correctness**:
   - The logic for constructing the missing subsequence in the case where the boolean is `False` is flawed. The program attempts to find a missing character by iterating through the ASCII values, but this approach is not guaranteed to find a valid missing subsequence.
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the requirement to check all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the requirement to check all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and construct a valid missing subsequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False****
