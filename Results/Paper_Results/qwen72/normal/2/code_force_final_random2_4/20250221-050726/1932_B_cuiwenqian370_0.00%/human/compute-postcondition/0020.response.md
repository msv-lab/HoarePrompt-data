Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `index` is incremented by 5, `path` is `data[index]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0 but less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[index-1]`.
- `index` is incremented by 5, so its new value is `index + 5`.
- `path` is updated to `data[index]` (the new `index` value).
- `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content.
