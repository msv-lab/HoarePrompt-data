Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

The final value of `i` is `n`.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `path` of strings, where each string is either '@', '*', or another character. It returns the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters that can be collected without encountering a '*' character. If the list is empty, the function returns 0. If no valid path (without encountering '*') exists, the function also returns 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. n is a positive integer representing the number of signs, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. path is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.

        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is `2 * t + 1` (where `t` is the initial value of `t`), `path` is `data[index - 1]`, `results` contains the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is 1, `path` is `data[0]`, `results` must be a list with all elements processed, and `result` is the last element in `results`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves reading a number of signs and their periodicities, then applying a function (`func_1`) to these periodicities. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. After the function completes, the input data has been fully processed, and the results have been printed to the standard output.
