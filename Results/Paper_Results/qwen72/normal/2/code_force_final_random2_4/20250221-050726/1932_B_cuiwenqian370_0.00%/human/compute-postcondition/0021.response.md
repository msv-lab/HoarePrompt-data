Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `index` is incremented by 6, `path` is `data[index-1]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content.**

Explanation:
- `index` was initially incremented by 5, and the code snippet further increments `index` by 1, making the total increment 6.
- `path` is set to `data[index]` before the increment, so after the increment, `path` is effectively `data[index-1]`.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, including the conditions on `t`, the value of `n`, and the updated `results` list.
