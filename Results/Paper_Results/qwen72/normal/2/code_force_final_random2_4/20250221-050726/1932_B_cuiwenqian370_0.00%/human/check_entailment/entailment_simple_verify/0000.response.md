Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not address the problem described in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the year when the nth sign will occur, considering the sequential and strict occurrence of signs. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is entirely unrelated to the given problem. The program does not calculate the year of the nth sign based on the periodicities of the signs. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the specified task.

Final: **False**
