Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `index` is incremented by 3, `path` is `data[index]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0 but less than its previous value.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still the integer value of `data[index-1]`.
- The value of `index` is incremented by 3, which was already part of the initial state.
- The value of `path` is updated to `data[index]` instead of `data[index-3]`.
- The value of `results` remains unchanged and still includes the result of `func_1(path)`, where `path` was previously `data[index-3]`.
