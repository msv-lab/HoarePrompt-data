Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is incremented by 2, `path` is `data[index-2]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation:
- `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0 but less than its previous value.
- `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `index` is incremented by 2, which was already part of the initial state.
- `path` remains `data[index-2]`, which is still valid after the code execution.
- `results` still includes the result of `func_1(path)`, which was part of the initial state.
