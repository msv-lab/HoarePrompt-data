Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-2]`, `index` is incremented by 4, `path` is `data[index-1]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, so the total increment from the initial state is now 4.
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index-2]` because `index` was initially incremented by 3 and now by 1 more.
- The value of `path` is updated to `data[index-1]` because `index` is now 4 units greater than its original value.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0 but less than its previous value.
- The `results` list still includes the result of `func_1(path)`.
