Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the year when the nth sign will occur, considering the sequential nature of the signs. However, the functions provided seem to be dealing with a completely different problem, possibly related to a path or sequence with special characters (`@` and `*`), which is not relevant to the apocalypse signs problem.

Here is a correct approach to solving the problem:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(signs):
    year = 0
    for period in signs:
        # Find the next occurrence of the current sign after the last year
        while (year + 1) % period != 0:
            year += 1
        year += 1
    return year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        signs = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(signs))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code correctly implements the logic to find the year when the nth sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
