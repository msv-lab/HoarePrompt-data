Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is `2 * t + 1` (where `t` is the initial value of `t`), `path` is `data[index - 1]`, `results` contains the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` implicitly with each iteration until it reaches 0.
- **`n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`:** After the final iteration, `n` will hold the value of the last integer read from `data`, which is `data[index - 2]`.
- **`index` is `2 * t + 1` (where `t` is the initial value of `t`)**: The `index` variable increments by 2 for each iteration of the loop. If the loop runs `t` times, `index` will be incremented by `2 * t`. Since `index` starts at 1, the final value of `index` will be `1 + 2 * t`.
- **`path` is `data[index - 1]`:** After the final iteration, `path` will hold the last string read from `data`, which is `data[index - 1]`.
- **`results` contains the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop**: The `results` list will contain the results of `func_1(path)` for each of the `t` iterations of the loop.
