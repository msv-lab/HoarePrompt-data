The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If there is another element in `results`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `result` is the first element in `results`, and `results` must be a non-empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least two elements, and `result` will be the second element in `results`.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is 1, `path` is `data[0]`, `results` must be a list with at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in `results`**
