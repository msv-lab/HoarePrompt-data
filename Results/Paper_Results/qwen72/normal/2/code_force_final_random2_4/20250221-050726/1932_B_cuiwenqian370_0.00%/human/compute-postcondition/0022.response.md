Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `index` is incremented by 6, `path` is `data[index-1]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0 but less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- The value of `n` remains the integer value of `data[index-1]`.
- The value of `index` is incremented by 6.
- The value of `path` remains `data[index-1]`.
- The list `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content.
