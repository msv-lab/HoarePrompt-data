The function `func_1` takes a list `path` of strings, where each string is either '@', '*', or another character. It returns the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters that can be collected without encountering a '*' character. If the list is empty, the function returns 0. If no valid path (without encountering '*') exists, the function also returns 0.
