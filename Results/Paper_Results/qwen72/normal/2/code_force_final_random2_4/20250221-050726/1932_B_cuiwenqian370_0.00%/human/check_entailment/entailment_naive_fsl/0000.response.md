Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year in which the nth sign will occur, considering that signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve a different problem, specifically one involving a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the given problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the specified task.
