Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. `low` is either (0 + min(n, b)) // 2 + 1 if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, or remains 0 otherwise. `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b` if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, or is updated to `mid - 1` otherwise. `mid` is now (low + high) // 2. `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` (which was 0) and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`; otherwise, `profit_next` is less than or equal to `profit_mid`.** 

Explanation:
- The code updates `max_profit` to be the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition `if profit_next > profit_mid` does not affect the state of the variables in this snippet, so it remains part of the output state.
