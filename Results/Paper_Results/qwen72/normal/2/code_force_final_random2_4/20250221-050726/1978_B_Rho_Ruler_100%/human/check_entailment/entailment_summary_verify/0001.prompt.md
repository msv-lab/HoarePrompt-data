You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) and returns the maximum profit (`max_profit`) calculated during a binary search process. The function iterates through possible values of `mid` between 0 and `min(n, b)`, using a helper function `func_1` to compute the profit at each step. The final `max_profit` is the highest profit value encountered during these iterations. The input parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, where the `i-th` bun is sold for `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - We need to find the optimal value of `k` to maximize the total profit.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - `k * b` is the sum of the prices if all `k` buns were sold at `b` coins each.
     - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which represents the discount applied to the prices of the first `k` buns.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively.
   - It iterates using binary search:
     - Calculates the profit for the current midpoint `mid`.
     - Calculates the profit for the next midpoint `mid + 1`.
     - Updates `max_profit` with the maximum of the current profit and the maximum profit found so far.
     - Adjusts the search range based on whether the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search ensures that we efficiently find the optimal `k` by comparing the profit at the current midpoint and the next midpoint.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater, it means increasing `k` further might yield a higher profit, so we move the lower bound up.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is not greater, it means decreasing `k` might yield a higher profit, so we move the upper bound down.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where `k` can be `0` or `min(n, b)`.
   - The function correctly calculates the profit for large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. The binary search approach ensures efficiency, and the profit calculation is accurate.
