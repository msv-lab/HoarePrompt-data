Output State: **The loop terminates when `low` becomes greater than `high`. At this point, `max_profit` holds the maximum value of `profit_mid` encountered during the loop iterations. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `low` and `high` will have been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop, but their final values depend on the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` and the results of `func_1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `max_profit` will contain the highest profit value calculated during the process. The loop stops when `low` exceeds `high`, indicating that the search space has been exhausted. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as they were initially, while `low` and `high` will have been modified based on the comparisons made during the loop.
