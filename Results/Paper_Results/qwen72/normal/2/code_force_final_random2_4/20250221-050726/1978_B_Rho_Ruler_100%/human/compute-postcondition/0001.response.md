Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `max_profit` to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `max_profit`.
