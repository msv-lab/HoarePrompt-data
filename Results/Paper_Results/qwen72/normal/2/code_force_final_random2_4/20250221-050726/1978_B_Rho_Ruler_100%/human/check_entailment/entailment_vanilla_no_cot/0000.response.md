Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a solution to maximize Bob's profit from selling buns under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit when `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each step, plus the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.
   - It iterates using binary search, calculating the profit for the middle value `mid` and the next value `mid + 1`.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum profit found so far.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it adjusts the search range to the right half; otherwise, it adjusts to the left half.
   - This ensures that the function efficiently finds the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, ensuring that it produces the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
