Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit. The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given \( k \), and `func_2` performs the binary search to find the maximum profit. The program handles all edge cases, such as when \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) are at their minimum or maximum values, and it correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
