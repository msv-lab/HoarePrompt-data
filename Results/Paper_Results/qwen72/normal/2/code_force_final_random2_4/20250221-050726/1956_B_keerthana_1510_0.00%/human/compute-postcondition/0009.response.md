Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, and the loop has processed all the lines corresponding to the test cases. Each line has been split into a list of substrings (`elements`), and for each list, the sum of the counts of each unique element divided by 3 (integer division) has been printed.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.
- **`line`**: By the end of the loop, `line` will have processed all the lines corresponding to the test cases. The loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line in the input file, which corresponds to the lines containing the card numbers for each test case.
- **`elements`**: For each iteration, `elements` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the current `line` by whitespace. This list is used to count the occurrences of each unique element and then compute the sum of these counts divided by 3.
- **Output**: For each test case, the loop prints the sum of the counts of each unique element in `elements` divided by 3 (using integer division). This process is repeated for all test cases.

Thus, after the loop completes all its iterations, the final output state reflects that all test cases have been processed, and the required computation has been performed and printed for each test case.
