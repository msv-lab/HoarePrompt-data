t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of cards each player receives. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
