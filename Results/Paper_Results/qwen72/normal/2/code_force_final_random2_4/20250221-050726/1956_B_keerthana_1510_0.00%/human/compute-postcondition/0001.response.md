The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) and assigns this list to the variable `elements`. 

Given the initial state:
- The input must have at least 3 lines, with the first line specifying `t` as the number of test cases.
- Each subsequent pair of lines represents a test case.
- `line` is the first line of the first test case, which contains the value of `n` for that test case.

After executing the code:
- `elements` is now a list containing the substrings from `line`, split by whitespace.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `line` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `line` is the first line of the first test case, `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace.**
