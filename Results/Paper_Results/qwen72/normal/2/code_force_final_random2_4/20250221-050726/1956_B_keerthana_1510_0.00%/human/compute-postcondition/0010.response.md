The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function accepts multiple inputs. These inputs include:

- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the number of cards each player receives.
- A list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice, representing the integers on the cards in your hand.

The function processes these inputs and, for each test case, returns a result based on the specific logic applied to the cards in your hand. However, the exact nature of the output (what the function returns) is not specified in the problem statement. Given the context, the function likely returns some form of evaluation or processing result for each test case, possibly related to the distribution or properties of the cards.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand. It processes each test case and returns a result for each, likely related to the properties or distribution of the cards.**
