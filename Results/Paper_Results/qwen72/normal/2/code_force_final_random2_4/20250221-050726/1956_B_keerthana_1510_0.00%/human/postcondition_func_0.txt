The function reads input from a file where each test case consists of a list of integers representing cards. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the counts of each unique card value divided by 3 (using integer division) and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function has printed a result for each one, reflecting the distribution of card values in each test case.
