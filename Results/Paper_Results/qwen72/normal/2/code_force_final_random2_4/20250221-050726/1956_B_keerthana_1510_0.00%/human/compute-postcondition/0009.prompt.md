Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of cards each player receives. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
    elements = line.split()
    print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the number of test cases, `line` is the first line of the first test case, `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the number of test cases, `line` is the first line of the second test case, `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the number of test cases, `line` is the first line of the third test case, `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
