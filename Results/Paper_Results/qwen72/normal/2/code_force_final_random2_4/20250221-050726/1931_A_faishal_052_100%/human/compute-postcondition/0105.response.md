The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. Based on the initial state, the value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`. Let's consider each case:

1. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is initially `[1]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]`.
2. If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `arr` is initially `[26]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[26, 1]`.
3. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` is initially `[]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `info` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1]`. If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` >= 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]` and `arr` is `[1]`.**
