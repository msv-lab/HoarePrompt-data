The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range function parameter `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute 2 times regardless of the initial value of `j` because the range function specifies a fixed number of iterations (2). However, for the loop to start, `j` should be set to the starting point of the range, which is `0`.

State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]`, `arr` is `[]`**
