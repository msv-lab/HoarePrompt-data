Output State: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin where the first line is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. `cases` is assigned the value of the integer input from the first line. `info` is an empty list.**
