Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `lex` remains unchanged, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]`, `arr` is `[]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = []` reassigns the variable `arr` to an empty list.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, `info`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
