The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust `j`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. However, since the loop condition is `j in range(2)`, which means `j` must be less than 2, the loop will not execute again when `j` is 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (if it were to occur) would be:
State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1]`. If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` >= 52, `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value of `lex`: If the original `lex` was less than 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26]`. If the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26 + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If the original `lex` was 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]` and `arr` is `[26]`. If the original `lex` was greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.**

However, since `j` is now 2, the loop will not execute again.
