The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Based on the initial state, the value of `arr` before this operation depends on the value of `lex`:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is set to `[1]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is set to `[26]`.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is set to `[26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list.

After appending 26 to `arr`, the new value of `arr` will be:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` becomes `[26]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, and `info` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78, `info` is updated based on the value of `lex`, and `arr` is updated to `[1, 26]` if `lex` is less than 28, `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), and `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 78.**
