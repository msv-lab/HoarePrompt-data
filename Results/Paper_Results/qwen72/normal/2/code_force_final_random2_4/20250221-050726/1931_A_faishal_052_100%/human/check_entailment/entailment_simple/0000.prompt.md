Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin where the first line is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines each containing an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `cases` will have its original value (as it is not modified within the loop), `i` will be equal to `cases` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `j` will be 2 (the last value it reaches in the inner loop), `lex` will be the last input integer processed (unchanged from its final modification), and `info` will contain a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, structured as follows: For each input `lex`, if `lex` is less than 28, the list will be `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), the list will be `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), the list will be `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Each list in `info` is sorted in ascending order.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `cases` remains unchanged, `i` equals `cases` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `j` is 3 (the last value it reaches in the inner loop), `lex` is the last input integer processed, and `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs. The structure of each list in `info` is determined by the value of `lex`: if `lex` is less than 28, the list is `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), the list is `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), the list is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Each list in `info` is sorted in ascending order. The variable `temp` is the string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`.
