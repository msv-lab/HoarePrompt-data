Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96` and `info[1][1] + 96`.** 

Explanation: The code appends a new character to the string `temp`. This character is determined by converting the integer value `info[1][1] + 96` to its corresponding ASCII character using the `chr` function. The initial value of `temp` was already a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[1][0] + 96`. After executing the code, `temp` now contains both characters. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, and `info`) remain unchanged.
