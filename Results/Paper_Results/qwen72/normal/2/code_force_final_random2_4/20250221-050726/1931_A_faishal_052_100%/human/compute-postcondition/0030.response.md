The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to the range specified in the loop head. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will execute twice as long as `j` is within this range.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. However, since the loop condition is `j in range(2)`, which means `j` should be less than 2, the loop will not execute again once `j` is 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the final state if the loop were to continue) would be:
State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged based on the conditions provided at the end of the previous iteration.** 

However, since `j` is now 2, the loop will not execute again.
