Reasoning:

The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded to a given integer. The approach taken by the program involves breaking down the integer into three parts that represent the positions of the letters in the alphabet, ensuring the resulting word is the smallest possible.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the encoded values for each test case.
2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to distribute the value of `lex` (the encoded value) across three positions.
   - It uses a loop to assign values to the first two positions (`arr`) based on the value of `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it assigns 1 to both positions and subtracts 1 from `lex` twice.
   - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it assigns 26 to the first position and adjusts `lex` accordingly.
   - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it assigns 26 to both positions and adjusts `lex` accordingly.
   - The remaining value of `lex` is assigned to the third position.
3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The program sorts the list `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - It then converts the positions back to characters and prints the result.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Distribution**:
   - The logic for distributing the value of `lex` is flawed. Specifically, the program does not handle the distribution of values correctly to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
   - For example, for `lex = 24`, the program should produce "aav" (1 + 1 + 22), but the current logic might produce "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1) or "aaz" (1 + 1 + 22) incorrectly.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `lex` is exactly 3 or 78.
   - For `lex = 3`, the correct output should be "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1), but the program might produce incorrect results due to the flawed distribution logic.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two positions.
2. Adjust the remaining value to the third position.
3. Ensure the resulting word is lexicographically smallest by sorting the positions.

### Conclusion:
The current program does not correctly handle the distribution of values to ensure the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
