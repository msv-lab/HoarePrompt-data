Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 28. If `lex` is less than 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]` and `arr` is `[]`. If `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26]`.***
