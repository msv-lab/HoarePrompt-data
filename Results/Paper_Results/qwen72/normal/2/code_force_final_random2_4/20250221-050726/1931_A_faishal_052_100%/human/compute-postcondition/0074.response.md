The code snippet `lex = lex - 1` decrements the value of `lex` by 1. We need to consider the different conditions specified in the initial state to determine the final value of `lex` and whether any other variables are affected.

### Initial Conditions:
- `cases` must be at least 1
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78.
- If `lex` is less than 28, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]], and `arr` is set to [1, 1].
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]], and `arr` is set to [26, 1].
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` is set to [26, 1].
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` remains [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` remains [1].
- In all cases, `lex` is now `lex - 1` if it was less than 28, otherwise `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78.

### Impact of the Code:
- `lex` is decremented by 1.

### Calculation:
- If `lex` was less than 28, it is now `lex - 1`.
- If `lex` was between 28 and 51, it is now `lex - 1`.
- If `lex` was between 52 and 78, it is now `lex - 1` and adjusted to be within the range [26, 52].
- If `lex` was greater than 78, it is now `lex - 1`.

### Output State:
- `cases` must be at least 1
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `lex` is now `lex - 1` if it was less than 28, otherwise `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78.
- `info` and `arr` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is now `lex - 1` if it was less than 28, otherwise `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78, `info` and `arr` remain unchanged.**
