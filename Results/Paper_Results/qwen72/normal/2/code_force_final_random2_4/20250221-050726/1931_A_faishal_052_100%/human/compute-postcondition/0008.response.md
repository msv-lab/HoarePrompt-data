Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is [1], `lex` is an input integer and its current value is less than 27, `j` is 0.** 

The value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, so its new value is one less than its initial value, which was less than 28. All other variables remain unchanged.
