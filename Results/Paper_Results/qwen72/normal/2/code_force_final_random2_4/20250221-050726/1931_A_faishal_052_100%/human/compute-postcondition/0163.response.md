Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and processes it to generate a list of integers based on specific conditions. It then sorts these lists and constructs a string from the first three elements of each list by converting them to their corresponding lowercase letters (using ASCII values). Finally, it prints these strings to standard output, one per line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
