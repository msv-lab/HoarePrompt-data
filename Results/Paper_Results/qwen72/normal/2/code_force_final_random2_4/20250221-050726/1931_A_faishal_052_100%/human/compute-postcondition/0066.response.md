Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78, `info` is updated based on the value of `lex` as described in the initial state, and `arr` is updated to `[1, 26]` if `lex` is less than 2, `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 2 and 52 (inclusive), and `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 52.**

Explanation:
- `lex` is reduced by 26, so its new value is within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78.
- The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The `info` and `arr` updates are based on the new value of `lex` after the subtraction:
  - If `lex` is less than 2 (originally less than 28), `arr` is `[1, 26]`.
  - If `lex` is between 2 and 52 (originally between 28 and 78), `arr` is `[26, 26]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than 52 (originally greater than 78), `arr` is `[26]`.
