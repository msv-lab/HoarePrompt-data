The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. The value of `lex` depends on the conditions specified in the initial state. Let's evaluate the output state based on these conditions:

1. If `lex` is less than 28:
   - `arr` is [1, 1, 1]
   - `lex` is `lex - 3`
   - After appending `lex`, `arr` becomes [1, 1, 1, `lex - 3`]

2. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive):
   - `arr` is [26, 1, 1]
   - `lex` is `lex - 27`
   - After appending `lex`, `arr` becomes [26, 1, 1, `lex - 27`]

3. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive):
   - `arr` is [26, 26, 26]
   - `lex` is `lex - 78`
   - After appending `lex`, `arr` becomes [26, 26, 26, `lex - 78`]

4. If `lex` is greater than 78:
   - `arr` is [26, 26, 26]
   - `lex` is `lex - 78`
   - After appending `lex`, `arr` becomes [26, 26, 26, `lex - 78`]

The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1, 1, 1, `lex - 3`]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26, 1, 1, `lex - 27`]. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is [26, 26, 26, `lex - 78`]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is [26, 26, 26, `lex - 78`].**
