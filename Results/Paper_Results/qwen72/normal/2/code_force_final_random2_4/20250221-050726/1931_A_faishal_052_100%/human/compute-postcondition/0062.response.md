The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the constant `2`, so we can only adjust `j`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `2`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `j` will be 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `arr` is updated based on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is decremented by 1, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]], and `arr` is set to [1]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]], and `arr` is set to [26]. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` is set to [26]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` remains [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` remains an empty list. In all cases, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78.**
