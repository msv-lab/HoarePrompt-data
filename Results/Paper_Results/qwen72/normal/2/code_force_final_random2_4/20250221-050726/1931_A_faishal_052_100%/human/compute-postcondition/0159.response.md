Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is the string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `temp` will contain a string composed of three characters. Each character corresponds to the ASCII value of the respective element in the list `info[2]` (at indices 0, 1, and 2) plus 96. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial or previously stated conditions.
