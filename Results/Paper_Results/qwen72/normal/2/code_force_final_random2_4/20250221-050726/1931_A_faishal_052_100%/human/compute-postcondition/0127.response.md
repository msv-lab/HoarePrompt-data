Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex - 2]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1, 1, lex]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1, 1, lex]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26, 1, lex]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater and originally between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 25 + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26, 1, lex]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater and originally 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1, lex]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition, with `arr` now being `[1, 26, 1, lex]` or `[26, 26, 1, lex]` depending on the original value of `lex`.**
