Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged based on the conditions provided at the end of the previous iteration. If `lex` < 52, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `arr` now includes the value 26 at the end. If `lex` ≥ 52 and `lex` ≤ 78, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`, and `arr` now includes the value 26 at the end. Otherwise, `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged.***
