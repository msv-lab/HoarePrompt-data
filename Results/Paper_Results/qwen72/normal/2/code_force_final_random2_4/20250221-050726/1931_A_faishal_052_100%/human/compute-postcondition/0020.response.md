The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value, which is 2. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26]. If `lex` is greater than 51, `arr` is an empty list if `lex` is greater than 78, otherwise `arr` is [26]**
