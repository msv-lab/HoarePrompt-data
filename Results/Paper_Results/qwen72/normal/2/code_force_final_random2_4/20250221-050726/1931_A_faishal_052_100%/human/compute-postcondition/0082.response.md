Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted as follows: if `lex` was initially less than 28, it is now `lex - 2`; if `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 (inclusive), it is now `lex - 52`; if `lex` was initially between 52 and 78 (inclusive), it is now `lex - 52`; otherwise, `lex` remains unchanged. `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]] if `lex` was initially less than 28, to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]] if `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive), to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive) or greater than 78. `arr` is set to [1, 1] if `lex` was initially less than 28, to [26, 26] if `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), and remains an empty list if `lex` was greater than 78.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs twice because `range(2)` is specified.
- For each iteration, the value of `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value:
  - If `lex` was initially less than 28, it is decremented by 1 for each iteration, so after 2 iterations, it is `lex - 2`.
  - If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 (inclusive), it is decremented by 26 for each iteration, so after 2 iterations, it is `lex - 52`.
  - If `lex` was initially between 52 and 78 (inclusive), it is also decremented by 26 for each iteration, so after 2 iterations, it is `lex - 52`.
  - If `lex` was initially greater than 78, it remains unchanged.
- The `info` list is updated based on the initial value of `lex` but does not change further after the first iteration.
- The `arr` list is appended with the appropriate value (1 or 26) for each iteration, resulting in `[1, 1]` if `lex` was initially less than 28, `[26, 26]` if `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), and remains an empty list if `lex` was greater than 78.
