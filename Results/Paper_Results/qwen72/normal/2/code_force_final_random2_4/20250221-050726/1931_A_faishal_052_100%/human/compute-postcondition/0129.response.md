The code `info.append(arr)` adds the list `arr` to the end of the list `info`. Let's consider the different cases based on the value of `lex`:

1. **If `lex` < 28:**
   - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex - 2]]`
   - `arr` is `[1, 1, 1, lex]`
   - After appending `arr` to `info`, `info` becomes `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex - 2], [1, 1, 1, lex]]`

2. **If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive):**
   - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24]]`
   - `arr` is `[1, 1, 26, lex]`
   - After appending `arr` to `info`, `info` becomes `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24], [1, 1, 26, lex]]`

3. **If `lex` is 52 or greater and originally between 28 and 52 (inclusive):**
   - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 25 + 26]]`
   - `arr` is `[1, 26, 26, lex]`
   - After appending `arr` to `info`, `info` becomes `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 25 + 26], [1, 26, 26, lex]]`

4. **If `lex` is 52 or greater and originally 52 or greater:**
   - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27]]`
   - `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`
   - After appending `arr` to `info`, `info` becomes `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27], [1, 26, lex]]`

5. **If `lex` is greater than 78:**
   - `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.
   - If `lex` was originally between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1, 26, lex]`.
   - If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`.
   - After appending `arr` to `info`, `info` becomes `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24], [1, 1, 26, lex]]` or `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27], [1, 26, lex]]` depending on the original value of `lex`.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex - 2], [1, 1, 1, lex]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1, 1, lex]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24], [1, 1, 26, lex]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1, 26, lex]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater and originally between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 25 + 26], [1, 26, 26, lex]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26, 26, lex]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater and originally 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27], [1, 26, lex]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition, with `info` being `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24], [1, 1, 26, lex]]` or `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27], [1, 26, lex]]` depending on the original value of `lex`.**
