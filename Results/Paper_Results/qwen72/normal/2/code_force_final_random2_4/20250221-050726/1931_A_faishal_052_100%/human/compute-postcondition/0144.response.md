Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is now a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[1][0] + 96`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the `temp` variable by appending a character to it. This character is determined by converting the value of `info[i][j] + 96` to its corresponding character using the `chr` function. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, the character added to `temp` is derived from the first element of the second list in `info`. All other variables remain unchanged.
