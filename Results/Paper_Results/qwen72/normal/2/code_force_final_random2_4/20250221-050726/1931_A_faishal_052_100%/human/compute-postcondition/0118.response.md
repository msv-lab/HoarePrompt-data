Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If the original `lex` was less than 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex - 2]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]`. If the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1, 1]`. If the original `lex` was 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26, 1]`. If the original `lex` was 52 or greater and originally between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 25 + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26, 1]`. If the original `lex` was 52 or greater and originally 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If the original `lex` was greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition. `lex` is decreased by 1.**
