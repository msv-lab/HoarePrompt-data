### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`.
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the three letters should equal `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `arr` to store the indices of the letters.
   - It then tries to fill `arr` with the indices of the letters such that their sum equals `lex` (the given integer).

3. **Key Steps in the Program:**
   - The program iterates over a fixed range (2 times) to determine the first two letters.
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 28 and 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - Finally, it converts the indices in `arr` to characters and prints the resulting word.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for determining the first two letters is not optimal. It should consider the smallest possible values first to ensure lexicographical order.
   - The condition checks and logic inside the loop are not correctly handling all edge cases, especially when `lex` is close to the upper limit of 78.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and adjust the third letter accordingly.
   - We can use a more straightforward approach to ensure the correct lexicographical order.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the reasoning, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and may not always produce the lexicographically smallest word.

**Correctness: False**
