Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `cases` remains greater than 1.
- The variable `i` is still 1.
- The variable `j` is now 3, indicating the loop has completed its iterations.
- The variable `lex` remains the last input integer processed.
- The variable `info` still contains the original list of lists.
- The variable `temp` now holds a string with three characters, where each character corresponds to the ASCII value of the respective element in `info[1]` (the second sublist) plus 96. For example, if `info[1]` is `[5, 6, 7]`, then `temp` will be `"efg"`.
