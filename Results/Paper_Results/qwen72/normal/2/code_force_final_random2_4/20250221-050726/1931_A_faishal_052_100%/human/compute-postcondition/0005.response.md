The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `cases`, `i`, `arr`, or `lex` because the range is fixed at `2`, which means the loop will always run twice.

However, since the task specifies that we should adjust the states of objects in the loop head for the loop to execute, and given that the loop will always execute due to the range being `2`, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute based on the loop head alone.

But, to strictly follow the instruction and provide a modified state if needed, we can set `j` to `0` as it is the starting point for the loop.

State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0**
