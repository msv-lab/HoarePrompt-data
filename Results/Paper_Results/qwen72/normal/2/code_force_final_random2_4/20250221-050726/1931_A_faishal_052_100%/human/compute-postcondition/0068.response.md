Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78, `info` is updated based on the value of `lex`, and `arr` is updated to `[1, 26]` if `lex` is less than 2, `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 2 and 25 (inclusive) or between 26 and 51 (inclusive), and `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 51.**

Explanation:
- `lex` is reduced by 26, which shifts its value down by 26.
- If `lex` was initially between 52 and 78, it is now between 26 and 52, but since it was already adjusted to be within [26, 52], it remains within [0, 26].
- `info` is updated based on the new value of `lex`.
- `arr` is updated based on the new value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than 2 (originally less than 28), `arr` is `[1, 26]`.
  - If `lex` is between 2 and 25 (originally between 28 and 51), `arr` is `[26, 26]`.
  - If `lex` is between 26 and 51 (originally between 52 and 78), `arr` is `[26, 26]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than 51 (originally greater than 78), `arr` is `[26]`.

All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.
