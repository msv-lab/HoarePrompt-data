Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `lex` is adjusted as follows: if `lex` was initially less than 28, it is now `lex - 1`; if `lex` was initially between 52 and 78, it is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52]; otherwise, `lex` remains unchanged. `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]] if `lex` was initially less than 28, to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]] if `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive), to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive) or greater than 78. `arr` is set to [1] if `lex` was initially less than 28, to [26] if `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), and remains an empty list if `lex` was greater than 78.***
