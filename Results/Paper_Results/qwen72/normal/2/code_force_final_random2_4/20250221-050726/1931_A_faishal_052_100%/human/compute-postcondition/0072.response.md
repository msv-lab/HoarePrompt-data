The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and the range limit `2`. So we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, but since the loop condition checks if `j` is less than `2`, this will be the last iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78. If `lex` is less than 28, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]], and `arr` is set to [1]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]], and `arr` is set to [26]. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` is set to [26]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` remains [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` remains an empty list. In all cases, `lex` is now `lex - 1` if it was less than 28, otherwise `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78.**
