Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[0][2]` converted to a lowercase letter followed by the character corresponding to `info[0][3]` converted to a lowercase letter.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[0][2]` converted to a lowercase letter.
- The code snippet updates `temp` by appending the character corresponding to `info[0][3]` converted to a lowercase letter.
- The conversion to a lowercase letter is done using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, where `i` is 0 and `j` is 3.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, and `info`) remain unchanged.
