The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and the current values of `n` and `k` are equal. However, the `print` statement does not reference `n` or `k` at all. Instead, it simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1**
