Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if `n` equals `k`. If they are equal, it prints "YES" followed by "1" and "1". This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.

2. **Insufficient Coins**: If `n` is less than `k`, the function prints "NO". This is also correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The function initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` accordingly.
   - The variable `h` keeps track of the total number of jewels bought.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy the required number of jewels.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "2", "YES", and the costs.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**: The costs `[n - k + 1, 1]` are not always appropriate. For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the costs `[5, 1]` would mean Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall and 6 jewels from the second stall, which is incorrect because she should only buy 3 jewels in total.
- **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Stalls**: The function assumes that using only two stalls is sufficient, but this is not always the case. For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the function might not correctly distribute the prices across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly 8 jewels.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the function correctly sets up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One approach is to use a binary search or a greedy algorithm to find the appropriate prices for the stalls.

Given the current implementation, the function is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
