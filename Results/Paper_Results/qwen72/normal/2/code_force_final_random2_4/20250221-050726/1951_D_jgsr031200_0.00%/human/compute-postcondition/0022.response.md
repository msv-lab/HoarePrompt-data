Output State: **`n` is updated to `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new value of `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr`.
