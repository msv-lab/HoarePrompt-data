The code snippet `curr = n // i` updates the value of `curr` to the integer division of `n` by `i`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is updated to `n - i * curr`
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18
- `n` is not equal to `k`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`
- `i` is `1`
- `curr` is `n`

Let's calculate the new value of `curr`:

- Since `i` is `1`, `curr` will be `n // 1`, which simplifies to `n`.

Therefore, the value of `curr` remains `n`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n`**
