To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`.

- The variable `i` will take on the values from the list `costs`.
- The list `costs` is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`, and since `n` and `k` are positive integers with `n` being greater than or equal to `k`, the first element of `costs` will always be a positive integer. The second element is always 1.

Given this, the loop will always execute at least once because `costs` contains two elements. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

However, if we strictly follow the instruction to state the conditions for the loop to execute, we can say:

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is 0, `i` is the first element of `costs` (which is `n - k + 1`)**.
