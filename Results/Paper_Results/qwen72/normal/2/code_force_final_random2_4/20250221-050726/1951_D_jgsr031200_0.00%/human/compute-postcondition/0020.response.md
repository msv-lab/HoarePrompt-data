To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is updated to `n - i * curr`
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18
- `n` is not equal to `k`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`
- `i` is `1`
- `curr` is `n`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the list `costs`.
- The list `costs` contains two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `costs`.

2. **Initial State of `i`:**
   - At the start of the first iteration, `i` is set to the first element of `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be set to the second element of `costs`, which is `1`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- The only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`) remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` is updated to `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n`**

However, for the next iteration:
- `i` is now `1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`n` is updated to `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n`**
