The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` now contains one additional element from `a` at index `l-1`, and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]`, and `r` is `r - 1`.**
