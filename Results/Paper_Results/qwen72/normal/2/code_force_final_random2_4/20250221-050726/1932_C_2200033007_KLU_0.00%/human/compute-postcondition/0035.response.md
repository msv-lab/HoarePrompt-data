Output State: **`b` is a list with `n` elements, `v` is the first element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`b`**: This list contains `n` elements, as it was constructed by appending elements from `a` based on the characters in `s`.
- **`v`**: After the loop completes, `v` is the first element of `b` because the loop iterates over `b` in reverse order.
- **`n`**: This remains greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once.
- **`ans`**: This list contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order. For example, if `b` is `[b1, b2, b3, ..., bn]`, then `ans` will be `[b1 * b2 * ... * bn, b2 * ... * bn, ..., bn, 1]`.
- **`p`**: This variable holds the product of all elements in `b` after the loop completes.
- **`l` and `r`**: These indices are out of bounds, specifically `l` is `n` and `r` is `-1`, as they were updated during the construction of `b` based on the characters in `s`.
