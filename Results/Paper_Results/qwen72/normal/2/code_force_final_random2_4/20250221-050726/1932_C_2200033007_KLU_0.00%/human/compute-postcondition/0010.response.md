Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the first character of the string `s` is 'L', `b` has one more element appended from `a` at index `l`, and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the first character of `s` is not 'L', `b` has one more element appended from `a` at index `r`, and `r` is decreased by 1.***
