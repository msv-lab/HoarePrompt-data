You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1

        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `b` contains all elements from `a` in a modified order based on the characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` contains the element from `a` at index `l`, and `l` is `n`. If `s[i]` is 'R', `b` contains the element from `a` at index `r`, and `r` is `-1`. The list `b` will have exactly `n` elements, and the indices `l` and `r` will be out of bounds (specifically, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `-1`).
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `b` is a list with `n` elements, `v` is the first element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions given in the string `s` ('L' or 'R') to create a new list `b` with elements from `a` in a modified order. It then computes the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list. The returned list has `n` elements, each representing the product of all elements in `b` from that position to the end.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. This function takes `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` as parameters.

3. **Processing Commands**:
   - The program initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and appends the appropriate element to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - For 'L', it appends `a[l]` and increments `l`.
   - For 'R', it appends `a[r]` and decrements `r`.

4. **Calculating Products**:
   - The program initializes `p` to 1.
   - It iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, multiplying the current value of `p` by the current element and appending the result to the list `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans` to ensure the results are in the correct order.

5. **Output**: The main loop prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic:
- The program should calculate the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` at each step, not just append the removed element to `b` and then multiply them later.
- The current implementation does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements before each removal.

To fix this, the program should maintain a running product of the elements in the array and update it appropriately after each removal.

Corrected Implementation:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = (product * a[l]) % m if s[i] == 'L' else (product * a[r]) % m
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    return b
```

This corrected implementation ensures that the product is updated correctly after each removal and the results are printed in the correct order.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect logic in the original implementation)
