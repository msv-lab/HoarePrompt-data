Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the product of the remaining elements is calculated and updated after each command.

### Problem with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product of the elements that are removed (`a[l]` or `a[r]`) and appends this product to the result list `ans`. However, the problem requires the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command, not the product of the elements that are removed.
   - For example, if the array is `[3, 1, 4, 2]` and the command is `L`, the program should calculate the product of the remaining elements `[1, 4, 2]` and then take the modulo `m`.

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations**:
   - The program appends the product of the removed elements to the result list `ans` and then reverses the list at the end. This is incorrect because the problem requires the product of the remaining elements at each step, not the product of the removed elements.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```
- **Initial State**: Array `a = [3, 1, 4, 2]`
- **Command 1 (L)**:
  - Remove the leftmost element `3`.
  - Remaining array: `[1, 4, 2]`
  - Product: `1 * 4 * 2 = 8`
  - Modulo 6: `8 % 6 = 2`
  - Expected output: `2`
  - Actual output: `3` (incorrect)

- **Command 2 (R)**:
  - Remove the rightmost element `2`.
  - Remaining array: `[1, 4]`
  - Product: `1 * 4 = 4`
  - Modulo 6: `4 % 6 = 4`
  - Expected output: `4`
  - Actual output: `2` (incorrect)

- **Command 3 (R)**:
  - Remove the rightmost element `4`.
  - Remaining array: `[1]`
  - Product: `1`
  - Modulo 6: `1 % 6 = 1`
  - Expected output: `1`
  - Actual output: `4` (incorrect)

- **Command 4 (L)**:
  - Remove the leftmost element `1`.
  - Remaining array: `[]`
  - Product: `1` (since the array is empty, the product is 1)
  - Modulo 6: `1 % 6 = 1`
  - Expected output: `1`
  - Actual output: `1` (correct, but only by coincidence)

### Correct Approach:
To fix the program, you should maintain the product of the remaining elements and update it after each command. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    results = []
    for i in range(n):
        results.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[0], m-2, m)) % m
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[-1], m-2, m)) % m
            a.pop(-1)
    
    return results
```

This approach uses modular arithmetic to efficiently update the product after each command, ensuring that the product of the remaining elements is correctly calculated and updated.
