Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. This function takes `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` as parameters.

3. **Processing Commands**:
   - The program initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and appends the appropriate element to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - For 'L', it appends `a[l]` and increments `l`.
   - For 'R', it appends `a[r]` and decrements `r`.

4. **Calculating Products**:
   - The program initializes `p` to 1.
   - It iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, multiplying the current value of `p` by the current element and appending the result to the list `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans` to ensure the results are in the correct order.

5. **Output**: The main loop prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic:
- The program should calculate the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` at each step, not just append the removed element to `b` and then multiply them later.
- The current implementation does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements before each removal.

To fix this, the program should maintain a running product of the elements in the array and update it appropriately after each removal.

Corrected Implementation:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = (product * a[l]) % m if s[i] == 'L' else (product * a[r]) % m
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    return b
```

This corrected implementation ensures that the product is updated correctly after each removal and the results are printed in the correct order.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect logic in the original implementation)
