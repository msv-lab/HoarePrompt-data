The code snippet `b.append(a[l])` adds the element at index `l` of list `a` to the list `b`. This operation does not change the value of `l`, `r`, or `n`, but it modifies the list `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` now contains one additional element from `a` at index `l-1`, and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]`, and `r` is `r - 1`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `b` now contains one additional element from `a` at index `l`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` contains one additional element from `a` at index `l`, `l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged.**
