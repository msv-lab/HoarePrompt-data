Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `b` contains all elements from `a` in a modified order based on the characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` contains the element from `a` at index `l`, and `l` is `n`. If `s[i]` is 'R', `b` contains the element from `a` at index `r`, and `r` is `-1`. The list `b` will have exactly `n` elements, and the indices `l` and `r` will be out of bounds (specifically, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `-1`). `ans` is an empty list. `p` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for v in reversed(b):
    p = p * v
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a list with at least 1 element, `v` is the last element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing `[p]`, `p` is `v`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `v` is the second-to-last element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing `[p * v, p]`, `p` is the product of the last element and the second-to-last element of `b`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a list with at least 3 elements, `v` is the last element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing `[p * v, p, p]`, `p` is the product of the last element of `b` and itself, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
