Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. Here's a breakdown of why the solution works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Card Frequencies**: For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand. It initializes a frequency array `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
3. **Calculating Maximum Points**: The program iterates through the frequency array and calculates the maximum points you can get. For each integer `x`, if it appears more than once in your hand (`cnt[x] > 1`), you can get `max(0, x - 1)` points from it. This is because you can only score a point if there is already a card with the same integer on the table, and you can place the second card to score that point.
4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total points for each test case.

The logic ensures that you maximize your points while considering that Nene will play optimally to maximize her points and minimize yours. The solution handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the solution is correct.
