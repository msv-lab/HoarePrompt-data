The value of `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1. Since `x` is the third element in the list `a`, the element at index `x` in `cnt` was initially 2, and now it becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except for the element at index `x` which is now 3, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`.**
