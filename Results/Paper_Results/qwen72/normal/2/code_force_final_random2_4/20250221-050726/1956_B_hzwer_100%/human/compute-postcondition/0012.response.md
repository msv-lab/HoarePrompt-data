Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `cnt` will contain the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. Specifically, `cnt[i]` will hold the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they were initially set, and `a` remains the same list of integers provided by the user.
