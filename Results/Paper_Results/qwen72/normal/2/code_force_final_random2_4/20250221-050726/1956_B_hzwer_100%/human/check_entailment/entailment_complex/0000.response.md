Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game, given the constraints and rules described. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding how the scoring works and how the opponent (Nene) will play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

### Key Points:
1. **Counting Card Frequencies**: The program correctly counts the frequency of each card number in the player's hand using the `cnt` array. This is essential because the number of points a player can score depends on whether they can match a card already on the table.

2. **Calculating Points**: The program calculates the maximum number of points the player can score by summing `max(0, x - 1)` for each card number `x` in the `cnt` array. This formula works because:
   - If a card number `x` appears once in the player's hand, they cannot score a point for it (since there is no matching card on the table initially).
   - If a card number `x` appears twice, the player can score one point by playing the second card after the first card has been played and matched by Nene.

3. **Optimal Play by Nene**: The program assumes that Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize the player's score. The logic in the program implicitly handles this by focusing on the player's optimal strategy, which is to maximize their own score given Nene's optimal play.

### Verification:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n` and the list of card numbers.
- **Frequency Counting**: The `cnt` array is correctly populated with the frequency of each card number.
- **Point Calculation**: The calculation of points using `max(0, x - 1)` is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.
- **Output**: The program prints the calculated points for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
