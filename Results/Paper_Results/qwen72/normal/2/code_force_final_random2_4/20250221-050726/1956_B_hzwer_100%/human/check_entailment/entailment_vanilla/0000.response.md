### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of points we can score in a card game where each player takes turns placing cards on a table.
   - The game involves a deck of 2n cards, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.
   - The goal is to maximize our score while considering that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize ours.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each integer appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - We need to count how many pairs of cards we have in our hand.
   - For each integer, if we have both cards, we can score 1 point when we place the second card on the table.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in our hand.
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in our hand.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each integer.
   - It calculates the total score by summing up `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`. This ensures that we only count pairs of cards (i.e., if we have 2 cards of the same integer, we can score 1 point).

4. **Optimality Consideration:**
   - The program correctly counts the pairs of cards in our hand.
   - Since Nene plays optimally, she will always try to score points whenever possible. However, the program focuses on our optimal strategy, which is to count the pairs of cards we have.
   - The logic of adding `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` ensures that we only count pairs, which is the correct approach to maximize our score.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where we have no pairs (i.e., all counts are 1), resulting in a score of 0.
   - It also handles the case where we have multiple pairs, correctly summing up the points.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points we can score by counting the pairs of cards in our hand. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
