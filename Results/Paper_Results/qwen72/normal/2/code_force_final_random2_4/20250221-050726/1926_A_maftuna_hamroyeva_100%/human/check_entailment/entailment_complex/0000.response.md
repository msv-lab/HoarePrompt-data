Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the input string, and then outputs the character that appears more frequently. The logic for counting and comparing the frequencies of 'A' and 'B' is implemented correctly. The program handles the constraints and the example provided in the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
