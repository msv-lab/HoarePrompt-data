Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and does not contain the substring 'map', `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`.
Code of the loop:
while s.find('pie') != -1:
    s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
    ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and no longer contains the substring 'pie' at its first occurrence, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s` plus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` no longer contains the substring 'pie' at the original position, instead it contains 'p' at that position, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s` plus 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` no longer contains the first occurrence of 'pie' and the character immediately following it, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s` plus 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
