The only variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s.find('pie')` is not `-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` no longer contains the substring 'pie' at the original position, but it contains 'p' at that position. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain the substring 'pie' at some position.

State: **`s` must contain the substring 'pie' at some position, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s` plus 2**
