The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s` plus 2. After incrementing `ans` by 1, the new value of `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s` plus 3. The state of `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` no longer contains the first occurrence of 'pie' and the character immediately following it, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s` plus 3.**
