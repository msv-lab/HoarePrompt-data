Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate the substrings "pie" and "map". The approach taken in the program is to iteratively find and remove these substrings until they no longer exist in the string, counting the number of removals.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually by reading the length of the string and the string itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The special case where `s == 'mapie'` is handled by returning 1. However, this specific check is unnecessary because the subsequent logic will handle this case correctly without this special condition.
   - The function uses a loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "map" and counts how many times it is removed.
   - Similarly, another loop finds and removes occurrences of the substring "pie" and updates the count.
   - The function returns the total count of removals, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles strings that do not contain either "pie" or "map" by returning 0, which is correct.
   - It also handles cases where the substrings overlap or are adjacent, such as "mapie" or "mappie".

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program's approach is straightforward and works within the constraints given. The time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substrings being searched (which is fixed at 3). This is efficient enough for the given constraints.

5. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The special case `if (s == 'mapie')` is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program. The general logic already handles this case.

Given the above points, the program is logically correct and handles all specified cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
