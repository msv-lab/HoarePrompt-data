Output State: **`s` no longer contains the substring 'pie', and `ans` is the number of times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`.
- Each iteration of the loop removes one occurrence of 'pie' from `s` and increments the counter `ans` by 1.
- After all iterations, the loop will have removed all occurrences of 'pie' from `s`, and `ans` will reflect the total number of times 'pie' was found and removed.
- Therefore, the final output state is that `s` no longer contains the substring 'pie', and `ans` is the total count of 'pie' removals.
