You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and s is not equal to 'mapie'
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and does not contain the substring 'map', `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: `s` no longer contains the substring 'pie', and `ans` is the number of times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a specific issue that makes it incorrect according to the problem description. The function `func_1` incorrectly handles the case where the string "mapie" is present. The function checks if the string is exactly "mapie" and returns 1, which is incorrect because "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie" substrings, and thus should require the removal of 2 characters to become beautiful.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- Input: `s = "mapie"`
- Expected Output: `2` (since "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie", and removing 2 characters will make it beautiful)
- Actual Output: `1` (due to the incorrect check in the function)

This specific case demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
