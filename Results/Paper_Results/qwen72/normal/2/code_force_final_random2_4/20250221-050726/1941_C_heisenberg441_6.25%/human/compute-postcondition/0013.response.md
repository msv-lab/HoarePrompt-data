Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and does not contain the substring 'map', `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the string `s` contains the substring 'map'.
- Each iteration of the loop removes the first occurrence of 'map' from `s` by slicing the string before and after the 'map' substring, effectively removing the 'm' and keeping the 'a' and the rest of the string.
- The variable `ans` is incremented each time the loop runs, counting how many times the substring 'map' was found and removed.
- The loop stops when there are no more occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `s` will no longer contain the substring 'map', and `ans` will be the total count of how many times 'map' was removed from `s`.
