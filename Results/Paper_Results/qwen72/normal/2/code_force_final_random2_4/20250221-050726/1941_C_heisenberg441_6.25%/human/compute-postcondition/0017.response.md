The variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of the substring 'pie' in `s`. If `s.find('pie')` is not `-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` no longer contains the substring 'pie' at its first occurrence, but for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain the substring 'pie' at some point.

Since the loop condition checks for the presence of 'pie', and the state indicates that `s` no longer contains 'pie' at its first occurrence, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `s` now contains 'pie' at some position for the loop to proceed.

State: **`s` contains the substring 'pie' at some position, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s` plus 1**
