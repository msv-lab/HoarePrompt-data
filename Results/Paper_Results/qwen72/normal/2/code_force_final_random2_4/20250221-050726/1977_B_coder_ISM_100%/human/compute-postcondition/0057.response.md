Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The elements of `s` have been modified according to the rules of the loop: if two consecutive elements were '1', the first one was changed to '-1' and `flag` was set to 1. If `flag` was 1 and the current element was '0', it was changed to '1' and `flag` was reset to 0. Otherwise, the elements remained unchanged. The final value of `flag` is 1, and the 29th element of `s` is '0'.**
