Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of 30 elements where the element at index 1 is '1' and the rest are either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), `flag` is 0.** 

The value of `flag` has been explicitly set to 0, while all other variables and their values remain unchanged.
