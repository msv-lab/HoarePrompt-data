Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list of 30 elements representing the binary form of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). The loop has processed the entire list `s`, and any consecutive '1's have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1'. Any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been flipped to '1'. The final state of `s` will reflect these changes, and `flag` will be either 0 or 1 depending on the last operation performed in the loop. Additionally, either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.**
