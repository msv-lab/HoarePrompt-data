You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: `x` remains an input integer, `t` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `nalla` is `t-1`, `length` is 30 or 31, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The list `s` will have been processed such that any occurrence of `-1` followed by `1` will result in the `-1` moving one position to the left and the `1` becoming `0`. This process will continue through the entire list up to the 29th index. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', the 29th element of `s` (`s[29]`) is now '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `length` is 31, and `s` is a list containing 31 elements where the last element is '0'. If `flag` is 0, `length` remains 30 and the last element of `s` is not '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x < 2^30), converts `x` into a binary string representation, processes this binary string according to specific rules, and prints the length of the resulting string and the string itself. The processing involves converting certain sequences of '1's and '0's into special characters ('-1'), and then resolving these characters to ensure the final string meets the specified conditions. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the value of `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**: It converts the integer `x` into its binary representation using a loop that checks each bit from 0 to 29 (since \( x < 2^{30} \)). This is done by checking if the bit at position `i` is set in `x` using the bitwise AND operation (`x & pow(2, i)`).

3. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Bits**: The function then processes the binary string to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero bits are present. It uses a flag to track whether a carry-over needs to be applied. If a '1' is followed by another '1', it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets the flag to 1, indicating a carry-over. The flag is used to adjust subsequent bits accordingly.

4. **Final Adjustments**: After processing the entire string, the function checks if there is a remaining carry-over (flag is set) and adjusts the last bit or appends an additional bit if necessary.

5. **Output**: The function prints the length of the resulting array and the array itself.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Binary Conversion**: The binary conversion is correct and ensures that the array `s` contains '1' for each set bit in `x` and '0' otherwise.
- **Consecutive Non-Zero Bits Handling**: The logic for handling consecutive non-zero bits is correct. It ensures that no two consecutive non-zero bits are present by converting the first '1' to '-1' and setting a carry-over flag.
- **Carry-Over Handling**: The carry-over logic is correctly implemented, ensuring that the final array meets the requirement of no two consecutive non-zero bits.
- **Output Length**: The length of the array is correctly calculated and printed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It generates a valid array for the given integer `x` and ensures that no two consecutive non-zero bits are present.

### Correctness:
**True**
