Output State: **`x` is an input integer (new value), `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `length` is explicitly set to 30.
- The value of `i` was initially `length - 1`. Since `length` is now 30, `i` is updated to 29.
- All other variables (`x`, `t`, `nalla`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
