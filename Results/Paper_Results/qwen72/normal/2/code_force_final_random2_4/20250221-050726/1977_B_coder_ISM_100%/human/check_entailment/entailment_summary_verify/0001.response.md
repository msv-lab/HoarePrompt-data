### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the value of `x`. This part is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Binary Representation**: The function converts the integer `x` into its binary representation using a loop that checks each bit from 0 to 29. This is done by checking if the bit at position `i` is set in `x` using the bitwise AND operation (`x & pow(2, i)`). This step is also correct and aligns with the problem's constraints.

3. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Bits**: The function processes the binary string to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero bits are present. It uses a flag to track whether a carry-over needs to be applied. If a '1' is followed by another '1', it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets the flag to 1, indicating a carry-over. The flag is used to adjust subsequent bits accordingly. This logic is generally correct but has some issues:
   - The condition `(s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'))` should be simplified to `s[i] == '1' and s[i + 1] == '1'` for clarity.
   - The flag handling and adjustments need to be carefully reviewed to ensure they correctly propagate the carry-over without introducing errors.

4. **Final Adjustments**: After processing the entire string, the function checks if there is a remaining carry-over (flag is set) and adjusts the last bit or appends an additional bit if necessary. This part is mostly correct but could be more robust:
   - The condition `if flag and s[29] == '0':` should be checked before appending a new bit to avoid unnecessary operations.
   - The final adjustment loop `for i in range(1, length):` should be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles all edge cases, especially when dealing with `-1` and `1` pairs.

5. **Output**: The function prints the length of the resulting array and the array itself. This part is correct and aligns with the problem's output requirements.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Binary Conversion**: The binary conversion is correct and ensures that the array `s` contains '1' for each set bit in `x` and '0' otherwise.
- **Consecutive Non-Zero Bits Handling**: The logic for handling consecutive non-zero bits is generally correct but has some potential issues with flag handling and carry-over propagation.
- **Carry-Over Handling**: The carry-over logic is mostly correct but could be more robust to handle edge cases.
- **Output Length**: The length of the array is correctly calculated and printed.

### Conclusion:
The program generally handles the problem requirements and constraints correctly. However, there are some potential issues with the flag handling and carry-over propagation that could lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the program is fully correct.
