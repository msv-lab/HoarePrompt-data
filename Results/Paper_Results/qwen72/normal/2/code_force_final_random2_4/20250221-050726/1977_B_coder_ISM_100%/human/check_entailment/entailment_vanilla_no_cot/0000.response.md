Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Handling of Consecutive Non-Zero Values**: The logic to ensure that no two consecutive `a_i` values are non-zero is flawed. The code attempts to handle this by setting flags and adjusting values, but it doesn't always correctly propagate the adjustments through the array.

2. **Final Adjustment Logic**: The final loop that adjusts the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero values are present is not robust enough. It only checks pairs of elements and doesn't handle more complex scenarios where multiple adjustments are needed.

3. **Output Length**: The length of the array is fixed at 30, but the problem allows for a maximum length of 32. The code should dynamically adjust the length based on the actual number of non-zero elements.

Here is a corrected version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        while x > 0:
            if x % 2 == 1:
                s.append(1)
            else:
                s.append(0)
            x //= 2
        
        # Adjust the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero values
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, 0, -1):
            if s[i] == 1 and s[i - 1] == 1:
                s[i] = -1
                s[i - 1] = 0
                if i - 2 >= 0:
                    s[i - 2] += 1
                else:
                    s.insert(0, 1)
        
        # Remove leading zeros
        while s and s[-1] == 0:
            s.pop()
        
        # Print the result
        print(len(s))
        print(*s[::-1])

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Converts the integer `x` to its binary representation.
- Adjusts the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero values.
- Removes leading zeros to ensure the array length is minimized.
- Prints the length and the array in the correct order.
