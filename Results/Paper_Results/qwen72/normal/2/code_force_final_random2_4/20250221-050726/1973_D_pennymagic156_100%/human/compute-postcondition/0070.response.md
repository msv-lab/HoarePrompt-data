Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 1`, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 3, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l < n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since `l` was already defined as `func_2() + 1` in the initial state, the value of `l` remains unchanged. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`) remain in their initial states. The condition `l < n + 1` is still valid.
