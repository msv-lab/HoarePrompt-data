Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.

Explanation:
- The code `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1.
- The initial state already specifies that `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2() < n`.
- Since `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`, which is consistent with the initial state, the value of `l` remains `func_2() + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
