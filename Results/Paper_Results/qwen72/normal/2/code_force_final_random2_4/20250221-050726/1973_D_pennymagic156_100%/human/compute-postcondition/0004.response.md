The code snippet `v = func_2()` assigns the result of the function `func_2()` to the variable `v`. Since the definition of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value that `func_2()` returns. However, we know that `v` will now hold the value returned by `func_2()`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `i` is `n`.**
