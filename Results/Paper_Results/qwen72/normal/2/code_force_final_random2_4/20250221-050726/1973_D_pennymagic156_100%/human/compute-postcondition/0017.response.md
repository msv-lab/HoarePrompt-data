Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `i` is `n-2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value returned by `func_2()` to the variable `v`. Since the initial state already mentions that `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, no change occurs in the value of `v`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
