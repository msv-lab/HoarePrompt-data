To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \)
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists
- `i` is 1
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` (a value less than `n + 1`)
- Additionally, either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n // k`.

### Adjusting the State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n // k`.

### New State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`, `l`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop condition directly.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` (a value less than `n + 1`), and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**.
