The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Since `cnt` was initially `k - 2`, after decrementing, `cnt` becomes `k - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 2`, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`.**
