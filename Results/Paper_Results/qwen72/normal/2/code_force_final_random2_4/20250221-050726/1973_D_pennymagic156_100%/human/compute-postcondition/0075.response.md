Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 1`, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 3, `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l < n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, so `cnt` is now `k - 3`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `l`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4`, `k > 1`, `l < n + 1`, and the definition of `v` remain valid.
