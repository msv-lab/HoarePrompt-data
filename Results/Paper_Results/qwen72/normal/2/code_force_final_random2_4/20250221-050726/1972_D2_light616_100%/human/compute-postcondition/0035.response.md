Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is 3, `y` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 4 such that \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\), and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\).**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Conditions**: The loop starts with `x = 3`, `y = 1`, and `cnt` initialized based on the initial conditions.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop continues as long as \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\).
  - For each iteration, if `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
  - After each iteration, `y` is incremented by 1.
- **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when either \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\).
- **Final State**:
  - `x` remains 3 because it is not modified within the loop.
  - `y` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to 4 such that \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\).
  - `cnt` will be the sum of the contributions from all valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1`.

This final state ensures that all possible valid pairs have been considered, and `cnt` reflects the correct count based on the given constraints.
