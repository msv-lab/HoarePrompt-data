The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the state, it does not need to be adjusted. The value of `t` is decremented implicitly by the loop mechanism after each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `func_1()` has been called.**
