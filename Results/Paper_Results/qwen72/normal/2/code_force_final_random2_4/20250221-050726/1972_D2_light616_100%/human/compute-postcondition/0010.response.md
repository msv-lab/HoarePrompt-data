To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `cnt` is set to `min(n // 2, m // 2)` if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

3. **Evaluate the Conditions:**
   - For the current values of `x` and `y`:
     - `x + y = 1 + 2 = 3`.
     - The first condition: `(x + y) * x = 3 * 1 = 3 <= n`.
     - The second condition: `(x + y) * y = 3 * 2 = 6 <= m`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, both conditions must remain true.
   - Since `x` and `y` are part of the loop head, they are the only variables that can be adjusted.
   - However, the problem specifies that we should not make any assumptions about how `x` and `y` change within the loop body. Therefore, we cannot assume any specific changes to `x` and `y`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the current state, the loop can execute one more time if the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are still true.
   - Since `x` and `y` are the only variables in the loop head, and their values are fixed at the end of the previous iteration, no adjustments are needed to the state of `x` and `y`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is set to `min(n // 2, m // 2)` if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0**.
