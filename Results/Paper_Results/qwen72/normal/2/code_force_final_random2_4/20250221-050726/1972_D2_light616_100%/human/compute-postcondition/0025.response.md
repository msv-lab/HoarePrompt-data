Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is 3, `y` is 1, and `n` must be at least 9, `m` must be at least 4. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is updated to `cnt + min(n // 12, m // 4)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.***
