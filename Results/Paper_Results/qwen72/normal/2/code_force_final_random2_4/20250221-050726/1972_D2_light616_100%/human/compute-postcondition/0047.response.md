The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be at least 35, `m` must be at least 14, `x` is 5, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\), and if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1, remains valid.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 35, `m` must be at least 14, `x` is 5, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
