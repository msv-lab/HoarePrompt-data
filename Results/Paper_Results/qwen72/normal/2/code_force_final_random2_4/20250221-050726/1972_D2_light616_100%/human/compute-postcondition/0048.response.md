To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` must be at least 35.
   - `m` must be at least 14.
   - `x` is 5.
   - `y` is 3.
   - `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as both \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are true.
   - Given `x = 5` and `y = 3`, we need to check:
     - \((5 + 3) * 5 = 8 * 5 = 40\)
     - \((5 + 3) * 3 = 8 * 3 = 24\)

4. **Current Values**:
   - For the current values of `x` and `y`, the conditions are:
     - \(40 \leq n\)
     - \(24 \leq m\)

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `x` and `y` are fixed in the current state, the only way to ensure the loop can execute one more time is to ensure that `n` and `m` satisfy the conditions.
   - Given that `n` must be at least 35 and `m` must be at least 14, we need to adjust these values to ensure they meet the loop conditions:
     - `n` must be at least 40.
     - `m` must be at least 24.

### Final State:
Since the loop conditions depend on `n` and `m`, and the current values of `x` and `y` are fixed, we need to adjust `n` and `m` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` must be at least 40, `m` must be at least 24, `x` is 5, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
