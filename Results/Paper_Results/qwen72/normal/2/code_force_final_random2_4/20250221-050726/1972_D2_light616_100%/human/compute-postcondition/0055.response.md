To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- `x` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \cdot x > n\).
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `x`:**
   - `x` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \cdot x > n\).
   - For example, if \(n = 10\), then \(x = 4\) because \(4 \cdot 4 = 16 > 10\).

2. **Determine `y`:**
   - `y` is always 1.

3. **Calculate `cnt`:**
   - We need to sum `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\).
   - Since `y` is always 1, the conditions simplify to:
     - \((x + 1) * x <= n\)
     - \((x + 1) * 1 <= m\)
   - The pairs `(x, y)` must also satisfy `gcd(x, 1) == 1`, which is always true for any integer `x`.

4. **Sum Calculation:**
   - For each valid `x` (where \((x + 1) * x <= n\) and \((x + 1) * 1 <= m\)), calculate `min(n // ((x + 1) * x), m // ((x + 1) * 1))`.
   - Sum these values to get `cnt`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example with specific values for `n` and `m` to illustrate the process:
- Suppose \(n = 10\) and \(m = 10\).
- Then \(x = 4\) (as calculated above).
- We need to check pairs `(x, y)` where \(x = 4\) and \(y = 1\):
  - \((4 + 1) * 4 = 20\) (which is not <= 10, so this pair is invalid).
  - For smaller values of `x`:
    - If \(x = 3\), then \((3 + 1) * 3 = 12\) (not <= 10).
    - If \(x = 2\), then \((2 + 1) * 2 = 6\) (<= 10) and \((2 + 1) * 1 = 3\) (<= 10).
      - Calculate `min(10 // 6, 10 // 3) = min(1, 3) = 1`.
    - If \(x = 1\), then \((1 + 1) * 1 = 2\) (<= 10) and \((1 + 1) * 1 = 2\) (<= 10).
      - Calculate `min(10 // 2, 10 // 2) = min(5, 5) = 5`.
  - Sum these values: \(1 + 5 = 6\).

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `cnt`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all pairs (x, y) where gcd(x, y) == 1 and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m)**
