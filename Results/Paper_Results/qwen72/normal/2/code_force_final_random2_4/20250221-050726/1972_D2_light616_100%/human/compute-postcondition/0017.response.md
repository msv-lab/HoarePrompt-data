Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 4, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. Since the GCD of `x` (which is 1) and the new value of `y` (which is 4) is still 1, the condition for updating `cnt` remains true. However, since the code snippet only increments `y` and does not execute the logic to update `cnt`, `cnt` remains 0. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
