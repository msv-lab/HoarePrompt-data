### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve one test case.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are potential values for \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
   - The loop conditions ensure that \(x\) and \(y\) are within the bounds defined by \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is a necessary condition for the gcd to be 1.
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of the number of valid multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the solution is applied to multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\) and \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
   - The logic correctly checks for the gcd condition and counts the valid pairs.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The nested loops ensure that the solution is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The use of `math.gcd` and the conditions inside the loops ensure that the solution is correct and efficient.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Conditions**:
  - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is a necessary condition for the gcd to be 1.
  - The condition \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) ensures that the pairs \((x, y)\) are within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

- **Count Calculation**:
  - The count is incremented by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each \((x, y)\).

- **Test Case Handling**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the solution is applied to multiple test cases.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\) correctly, as it will not find any valid pairs in these cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
