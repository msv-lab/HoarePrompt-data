To solve this, let's break down the given code and its impact on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 35.
- `m` must be at least 14.
- `x` is 5.
- `y` is 2.
- `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 30, m // 6)`.

### Code:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x + y`:**
   - `x` is 5.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `x + y` is 7.

2. **Calculate \((x + y) * x\):**
   - \((x + y) * x\) is \(7 * 5 = 35\).

3. **Calculate \((x + y) * y\):**
   - \((x + y) * y\) is \(7 * 2 = 14\).

4. **Check conditions:**
   - \((x + y) * x = 35\) which is less than or equal to `n` (since `n` is at least 35).
   - \((x + y) * y = 14\) which is less than or equal to `m` (since `m` is at least 14).
   - Both conditions are satisfied.

5. **Calculate `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`:**
   - `n // ((x + y) * x)` is `n // 35`.
   - `m // ((x + y) * y)` is `m // 14`.
   - Since `n` is at least 35 and `m` is at least 14, both divisions will yield at least 1.
   - `min(n // 35, m // 14)` will be the smaller of these two values.

6. **Update `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 35, m // 14)`.

### Final Calculation:
- Let's assume `n` is exactly 35 and `m` is exactly 14 for the minimum case.
- `n // 35` is 1.
- `m // 14` is 1.
- `min(1, 1)` is 1.
- Therefore, `cnt` is incremented by 1.

### Output State:
- `n` must be at least 35.
- `m` must be at least 14.
- `x` is 5.
- `y` is 2.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 35, `m` must be at least 14, `x` is 5, `y` is 2, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
