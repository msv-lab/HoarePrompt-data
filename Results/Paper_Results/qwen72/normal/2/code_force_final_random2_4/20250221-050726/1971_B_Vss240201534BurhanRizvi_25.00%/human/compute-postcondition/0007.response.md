Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The input is a positive integer.
- `_` is 0.
- `s2` is a shuffled version of the string `s`.
- `s` is equal to `s2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides several variables and their conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'No'` regardless of the initial state of the variables.

Output: **No**
