The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides several variables and conditions:
  - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
  - `s` is a string of length at most 10, consisting of lowercase English letters.
  - The input is a positive integer.
  - `_` is set to 0.
  - `s2` is a shuffled version of the string `s`, and `s` is not equal to `s2`.

However, none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
