Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The input is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- `s2` is a shuffled version of the string `s`.

The `print(s2)` statement will print the shuffled version of the string `s`. Since `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`, it will contain the same characters as `s` but in a different order.

However, the exact order of the characters in `s2` cannot be determined without knowing the specific shuffling algorithm used. Therefore, the output will be a permutation of the characters in `s`.

Output: **s2 (where s2 is a shuffled version of the string s)**
