Based on the initial state provided:

- `kp` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `v2` is 1

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Let's break down the values of the variables used in the print statement:
- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is 1

Substituting these values into the print statement, we get:
```python
print(f'? {0} {0} {1} {1}')
```

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
