Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 2, `prev` is 2, and `r` is the user input.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects that `prev` is now 2, while all other initial conditions remain valid.
