Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` is 0 (or 2 if `r` is `>`).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`. Since the initial state does not specify any input being `<`, `v1` is 0.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `prev` is 0 (or 2 if `r` is `>`). Since the initial state does not specify `r` being `>`, `prev` is 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will substitute the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` into the string.
   - The string will be: `? 0 3 0 0`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 3 0 0**
