The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output stream, ensuring that any buffered data is written out immediately. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 2, `prev` is 0, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is updated to 1.**
