The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 3, `v2` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then the current value of `r` remains `<`. If `r` is not `<`, the value of `r` remains unchanged.**
