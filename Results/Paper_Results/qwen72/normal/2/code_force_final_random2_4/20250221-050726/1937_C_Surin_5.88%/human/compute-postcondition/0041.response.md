Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `i` is 2, `r` is the user's input, `prev` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to the current value of `i`.
- Since `i` is initially 2, `prev` is now 2.
- All other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
