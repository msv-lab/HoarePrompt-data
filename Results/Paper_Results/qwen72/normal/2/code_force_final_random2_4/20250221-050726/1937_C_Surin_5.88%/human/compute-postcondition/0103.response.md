The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`kp`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`**
