### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summary to verify its correctness step-by-step.

#### 1. Initialization and Input Handling
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

This part is straightforward and aligns with the problem description.

#### 2. Finding the Maximum Element
- The program initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates through the range `[1, n)`.
- For each `i`, it compares `p[v1] | p[v1]` with `p[i] | p[i]` using a query.
- If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `i`. This ensures that `v1` holds the index of the maximum element in the permutation after this loop.

This step is crucial. By comparing `p[v1] | p[v1]` with `p[i] | p[i]`, the program is essentially comparing the values of `p[v1]` and `p[i]` because `x | x = x` for any integer `x`. Thus, `v1` will indeed hold the index of the maximum element in the permutation after this loop.

#### 3. Finding the Second Element
- The program initializes `prev` to 0 and iterates through the range `[1, n)`.
- For each `i`, it compares `p[v1] | p[i]` with `p[v1] | p[prev]` using a query.
- If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`. This ensures that `prev` holds the index of the element that, when XORed with `p[v1]`, gives the maximum value.

This step is also correct. By comparing `p[v1] | p[i]` with `p[v1] | p[prev]`, the program is effectively finding the element `p[i]` that, when XORed with `p[v1]`, gives the maximum value. This is because the bitwise OR operation helps in identifying the highest possible value that can be achieved by combining `p[v1]` with another element.

#### 4. Outputting the Result
- After finding the indices `prev` and `v1`, the program prints the result in the required format.

This part is also correct and adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Constraints and Requirements
- The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.
- It correctly identifies the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.
- It handles the interaction with the judge correctly, including flushing the output after each query and the final answer.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases. It correctly implements the logic to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, and it adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
