Postcondition: ***`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 1, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `v1`, `v2`, `i`, `prev`, `kp`, `n`, and `g` remain unchanged.***
