The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. The loop condition is `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates numbers from 1 up to but not including `n`). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 1, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 1.**
