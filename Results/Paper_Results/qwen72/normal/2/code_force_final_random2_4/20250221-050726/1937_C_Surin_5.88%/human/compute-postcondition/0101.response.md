Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` command has been executed, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately.**
