Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 2, and `r` is the user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = input('')` assigns the user input to the variable `r`.
- All other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`, `v2`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The value of `r` is now the user input, which could be any string (including `<`, `>`, or any other input).
