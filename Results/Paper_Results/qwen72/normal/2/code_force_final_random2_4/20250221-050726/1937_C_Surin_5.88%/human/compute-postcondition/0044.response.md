Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `r` is the user's input. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `prev` depends on the user's input `r`. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` is 0.
   - `v1` is more complex:
     - If all inputs were `<`, `v1` is the last value of `i`, which is `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`.

4. **Assumptions and Calculations:**
   - Since `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3, the last value of `i` (if all inputs were `<`) would be `n-1`.
   - Without specific information about the sequence of inputs, we assume the worst-case scenario where the last value of `i` where the input was `<` is also `n-1` (since `i` starts at 3 and can go up to `n-1`).

5. **Final Output:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` is either 2 or 0 depending on the user's input `r`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- If `r` is `>`:
  ```
  ? n-1 3 n-1 2
  ```
- If `r` is not `>`:
  ```
  ? n-1 3 n-1 0
  ```

Output: **? n-1 3 n-1 [prev] (where prev is 2 if r is >, otherwise 0)**
