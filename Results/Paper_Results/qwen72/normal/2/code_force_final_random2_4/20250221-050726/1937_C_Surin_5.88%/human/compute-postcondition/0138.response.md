Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `r` is the user input. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is updated to 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`. Since no specific input has been mentioned as `<` in the initial state, `v1` is 0.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `prev` is explicitly given as 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 2 0 0**
