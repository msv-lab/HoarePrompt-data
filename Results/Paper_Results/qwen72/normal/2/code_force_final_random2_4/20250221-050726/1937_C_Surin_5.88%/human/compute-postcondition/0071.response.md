The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 3, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 2, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is updated to 2. Otherwise, the variables retain their original values.**
