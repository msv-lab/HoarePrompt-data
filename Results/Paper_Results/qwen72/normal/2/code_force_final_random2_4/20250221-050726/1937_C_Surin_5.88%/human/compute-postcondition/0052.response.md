The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `kp` relative to the result of `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `kp` must be incremented by 1, and the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`**
