You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates within an interactive environment where it interacts with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, and it must find two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The function receives input through a series of queries and outputs the result of the queries and the final answer in a specific format. The number of test cases t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: After the loop completes all its iterations, `kp` is `t-1` (where `t` is the total number of test cases), `n` is the last input integer for the final test case, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<` for the final test case, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1` for the final test case, and `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>` for the final test case, or 0 if no input was `>`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an interactive environment to find two indices `i` and `j` in a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, such that `p[i] ⊕ p[j]` is maximized, using at most 3n queries. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), with the total sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 10^4. The function returns the result of the queries and the final answer in a specific format.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
