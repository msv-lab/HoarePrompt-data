Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`**

Explanation:
- The code `g = 0` sets the variable `g` to 0.
- All other variables (`kp`, `n`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `kp` remains 1.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `v1` remains the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise it remains the last value of `i` where the input was `<`.
- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `prev` remains the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.
