To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `kp` is 2
- `n` is greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`
- `i` is 2
- `prev` is 0 (or 2 if `r` is '>')

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
- **`n`**: `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

### Final State:
- `kp` remains 2
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `g` remains 0
- `v1` remains the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`
- `i` is 3
- `prev` remains 0 (or 2 if `r` is '>')

### Final Answer:
State: **`kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 3, and `prev` is 0 (or 2 if `r` is '>')**
