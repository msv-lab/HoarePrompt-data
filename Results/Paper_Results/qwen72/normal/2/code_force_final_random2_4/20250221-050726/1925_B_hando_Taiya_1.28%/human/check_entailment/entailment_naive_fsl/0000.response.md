Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than `x`. According to the problem description, `n` can be as large as `x`, but the program's logic assumes that `n` will always be less than or equal to `x // i`. This assumption can lead to incorrect results when `n` is greater than `x`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 5
```
The expected output is `1` because the only way to split `5` into `5` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of `1`, making the GCD `1`. However, the program will not handle this case correctly because it does not consider the scenario where `n > x`.

To fix this, the program should handle the case where `n` is greater than `x` by ensuring that the GCD calculation takes into account the possibility of `n` being larger than `x`.
