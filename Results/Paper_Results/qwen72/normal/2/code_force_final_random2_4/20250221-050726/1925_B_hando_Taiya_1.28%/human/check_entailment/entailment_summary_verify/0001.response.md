### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems should be maximized.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the values of `x` and `n` from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` divides `x` without a remainder.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the divisors of `x` up to its square root, which is an efficient way to find all divisors.
   - It checks both `i` and `x // i` to ensure that the GCD is maximized.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` can be formed with the current divisor.
   - The use of `max` ensures that the maximum GCD is always stored in `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is equal to `x` (e.g., `x = 5`, `n = 5`), where the GCD is 1.
   - It also handles cases where `n` is much smaller than `x`, ensuring the maximum GCD is found.

5. **Function Summary Validation**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.
   - It correctly states that the function reads two integers `x` and `n`, calculates the largest divisor of `x` such that `n` is less than or equal to either `x // i` or `i`, and prints the result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: **True**
