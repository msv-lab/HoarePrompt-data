Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where x >= 1, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 3, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 1) and the result of `x // i`.
- Since `i` is 3, `x // i` is the integer division of `x` by 3.
- If `x` is divisible by 3, `x // 3` will be an integer, and `ans` will be updated to the maximum of 1 and this integer value.
- If `x` is not divisible by 3, `x // 3` will still be an integer, and `ans` will be updated to the maximum of 1 and this integer value.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
