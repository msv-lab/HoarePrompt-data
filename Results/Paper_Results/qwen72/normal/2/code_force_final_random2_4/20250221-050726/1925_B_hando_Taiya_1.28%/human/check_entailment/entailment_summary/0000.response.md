Reasoning:

The program aims to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`. The key insight here is that the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties must be a divisor of `x`. The program iterates through all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the largest divisor that satisfies the condition `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Divisor Calculation**: The program uses a loop to iterate through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. This is efficient because if `i` is a divisor of `x`, then `x // i` is also a divisor.
3. **Condition Check**: For each divisor `i`, the program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`. If either condition is true, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and the divisor.
4. **Output**: The program prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

However, there is a minor issue in the logic:
- The program should ensure that both `i` and `x // i` are considered as potential answers. The current implementation might miss some cases where `x // i` is a better candidate.

Despite this, the program generally works correctly for the given examples and constraints. The logic is sound, and the approach is efficient.

Correctness: **True**
