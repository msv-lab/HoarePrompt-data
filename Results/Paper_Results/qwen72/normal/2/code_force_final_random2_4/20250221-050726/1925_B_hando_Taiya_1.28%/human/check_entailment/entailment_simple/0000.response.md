### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and iterates over them. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The program aims to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.
   - It iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` using the `isqrt` function.
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to either `x // i` or `i`.
   - If either condition is true, it updates the answer (`ans`) to the maximum of the current `ans` and the divisor `i` or `x // i`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all divisors, the program prints the maximum GCD found (`ans`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where no valid divisor is found by initializing `ans` to 0.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints given in the problem statement.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently finds the divisors of `x` by iterating only up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for finding divisors.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problem set as defined in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
