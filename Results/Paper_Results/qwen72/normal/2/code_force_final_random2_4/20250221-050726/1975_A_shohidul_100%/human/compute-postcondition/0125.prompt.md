You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array a.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: _ is t-1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input. For each test case, if `check_all` is `True`, the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`. If `check_all` is `False`, the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If any `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` during the loop, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from the index where the condition was met to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. The loop will print 'YES' if both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The loop will terminate after the first iteration where `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` is true, or after checking all pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters but is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function should process each test case and return a result for each one. However, the specific output or return value for each test case is not provided in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
