To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2.
   - `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 2 to the end.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
