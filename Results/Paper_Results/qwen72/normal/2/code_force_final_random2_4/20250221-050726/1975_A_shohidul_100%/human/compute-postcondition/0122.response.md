Postcondition: **_ is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input. If `check_all` is `True`, the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`. If `check_all` is `False`, `i` is set to `n-1`, and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `n-1` to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the loop breaks and prints 'YES'. If either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both), the loop breaks and prints 'NO'. If `a[n-2]` is not greater than `a[n-1]`, the loop completes without breaking and no further action is taken.**
