The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` now holds an integer value provided by the user input. The constraints for `t` remain the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). The other variables (`n` and `a`) and their constraints are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array `a`.**
