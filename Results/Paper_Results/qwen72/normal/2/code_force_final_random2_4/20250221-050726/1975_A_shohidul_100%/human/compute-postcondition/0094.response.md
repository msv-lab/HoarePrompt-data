Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 2.
- `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 1 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise `False`.
- Additionally, `check_all_new` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement will execute as follows:

- The condition `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` indicates that the first element of `a` is greater than the second element.
- The list `new` is created by removing the first element of `a`, so `new` contains elements from index 1 to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` being `True` means that the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`.
- `new_all` being `True` means that the list `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element.

Since both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, the conditions for printing "YES" are met.

Output: **YES**
