Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array `a`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))]
                    )
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all_new and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `check_all` is `True`, then `a` is non-decreasing. If `check_all` is `False`, `i` is set to `n-1`, and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If any pair `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` was found such that `a[i-1] > a[i]`, a new list `new` was created starting from index `i` to the end of `a`. The conditions `check_all_new` and `new_all` were evaluated based on this new list. If both conditions were `True`, 'YES' was printed and the loop broke. If either condition was `False`, 'NO' was printed and the loop broke. If no such pair was found, the loop completed without printing anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is set to `n-1` if `check_all` is `False`, and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If `check_all` is `True`, the program continues as is. If `check_all` is `False`, and any `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` during the loop, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from the index where the condition was met to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. The loop will print 'YES' if both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The loop will terminate after the first iteration where `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` is true, or after checking all pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input. If `check_all` is `True`, the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`. If `check_all` is `False`, `i` is set to `n-1`, and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `n-1` to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the loop breaks and prints 'YES'. If either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both), the loop breaks and prints 'NO'. If `a[n-2]` is not greater than `a[n-1]`, the loop completes without breaking and no further action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
