Functionality: **The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters but is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function should process each test case and return a result for each one. However, the specific output or return value for each test case is not provided in the given information.**
