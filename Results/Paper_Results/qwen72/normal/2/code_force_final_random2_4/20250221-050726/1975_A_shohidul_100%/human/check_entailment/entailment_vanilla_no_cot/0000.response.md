Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping a prefix and a suffix. Specifically, the logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing after the swap is not correctly implemented.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Initial Check**: The initial check `check_all` correctly determines if the array is already non-decreasing. If it is, the program prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case. This part is correct.

2. **Finding the First Decrease**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` correctly identifies the first position where the array decreases (`a[i - 1] > a[i]`). However, the subsequent logic is flawed.

3. **Checking the New Array**: The program attempts to create a new array `new` by splitting the original array at the first decrease and then checks if this new array can be non-decreasing. The conditions `check_all_new` and `new_all` are intended to verify if the new array is non-decreasing, but they are not correctly formulated.

   - `check_all_new` checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array. This is not the correct condition. Instead, it should check if the last element of the prefix (before the split) is less than or equal to the first element of the suffix (after the split).
   - `new_all` checks if the new array is non-decreasing, but it does not consider the entire array after the swap. It only checks the new suffix part.

4. **Breaking the Loop**: The program breaks the loop immediately after finding the first decrease and performing the check. This means it does not consider other possible splits that might make the array non-decreasing.

A corrected version of the program would need to properly handle the split and ensure the entire array is checked for being non-decreasing after the swap. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-decreasing
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Find the first position where the array decreases
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                # Split the array at this position and swap the parts
                prefix = a[:i]
                suffix = a[i:]
                
                # Check if the new array is non-decreasing
                if (prefix[-1] <= suffix[0] and
                    all(prefix[j - 1] <= prefix[j] for j in range(1, len(prefix))) and
                    all(suffix[j - 1] <= suffix[j] for j in range(1, len(suffix)))):
                    print('YES')
                    break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the entire array is checked for being non-decreasing after the swap, and it correctly handles the conditions for the split.
