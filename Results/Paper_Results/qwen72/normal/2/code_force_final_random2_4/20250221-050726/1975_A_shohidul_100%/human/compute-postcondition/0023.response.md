Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])` checks if all elements in the list `new` are less than or equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- The value of `check_all_new` is determined based on this condition.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
