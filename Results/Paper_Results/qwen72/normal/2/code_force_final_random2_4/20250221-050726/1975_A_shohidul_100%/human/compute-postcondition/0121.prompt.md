Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is set to `n-1` if `check_all` is `False`, and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 1 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both), we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers read from the input, i is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise False, `new_all` is True if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise False. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
