Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`. The loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If any pair `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` was found such that `a[i-1] > a[i]`, a new list `new` was created starting from index `i` to the end of `a`. The conditions `check_all_new` and `new_all` were evaluated based on this new list. If both conditions were `True`, 'YES' was printed and the loop broke. If either condition was `False`, 'NO' was printed and the loop broke. If no such pair was found, the loop completed without printing anything.**
