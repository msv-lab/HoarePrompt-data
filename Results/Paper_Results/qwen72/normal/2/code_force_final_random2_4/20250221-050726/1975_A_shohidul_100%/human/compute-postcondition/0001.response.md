The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range, and it starts from 0 by default.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` should start from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0**
