Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise `False`.** 

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that contains elements of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `check_all_new` and `new_all` are still valid and depend on the updated `new` list.
