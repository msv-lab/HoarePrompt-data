Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, no changes are made. Otherwise, `b` is a string containing the characters from `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters from `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.***
