### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case. This part is accurate.

2. **Set Creation and Uniqueness Check**: For each string `s`, it creates a set `a` from the characters of `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, and thus it's impossible to rearrange `s` to form a different string. In this case, the function correctly prints 'NO'. This part is also accurate.

3. **Sorting and Reversing**: If the length of `a` is greater than 1, the function proceeds to sort the string `s` in both ascending and descending order. This is done using `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` and `c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))`. This part is correct.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it means sorting in ascending order did not change the string. In this case, the function prints the reversed string `c`.
   - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it means sorting in ascending order produced a different string, and the function prints `b`.

   This logic ensures that the output string is different from the input string `s` when possible. However, there is a potential issue here. The function assumes that sorting in ascending order will always produce a different string if the characters are not all the same. While this is generally true, it might not always be the case for certain specific inputs.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with all unique characters, the function will always produce a different string by sorting.
   - For strings with some repeated characters but not all the same, the function will also produce a different string by sorting or reversing.

   However, consider the case where the input string is already sorted in ascending order but has repeated characters. For example, if `s = "abbc"`, then `b = "abbc"` and `c = "cbba"`. The function will print `c`, which is correct. But if `s = "abcc"`, then `b = "abcc"` and `c = "ccba"`. The function will print `c`, which is also correct. However, if `s = "abcc"`, and we need to ensure that the output is different, the function should check if `b` is different from `s` and if not, try another method to ensure the output is different.

6. **Output Format**: The function correctly outputs 'YES' followed by the rearranged string when a valid rearrangement is possible, and 'NO' when it is not.

### Conclusion:
The given program is mostly correct, but it could be improved to handle edge cases more robustly. Specifically, it should ensure that the output string is different from the input string in all cases where it is possible to do so. However, the current implementation is sufficient to meet the problem requirements as stated.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
