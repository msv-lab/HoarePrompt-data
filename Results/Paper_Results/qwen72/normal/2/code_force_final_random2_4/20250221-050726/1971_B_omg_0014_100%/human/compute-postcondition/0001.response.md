To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range(n)` function, starting from 0 by default.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
