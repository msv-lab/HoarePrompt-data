### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case. This part is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Set Creation and Uniqueness Check**: For each string `s`, it creates a set `a` from the characters of `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, and thus it's impossible to rearrange `s` to form a different string. In this case, the function correctly prints 'NO'. This logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Sorting and Reversing**: If the length of `a` is greater than 1, the function proceeds to sort the string `s` in both ascending and descending order. This is done using `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` and `c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))`. This step is also correct and ensures that we have two potential rearrangements of the string.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it means sorting in ascending order did not change the string. In this case, the function prints the reversed string `c`. This is a valid approach because if `b` is the same as `s`, then `c` must be different from `s`.
   - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it means sorting in ascending order produced a different string, and the function prints `b`. This is also correct because `b` is guaranteed to be different from `s` if `b` is not equal to `s`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with all unique characters, the function will always produce a different string by sorting.
   - For strings with some repeated characters but not all the same, the function will also produce a different string by sorting or reversing.

6. **Output Format**: The function correctly outputs 'YES' followed by the rearranged string when a valid rearrangement is possible, and 'NO' when it is not. This matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement. The function summary and the original assessment are accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.
