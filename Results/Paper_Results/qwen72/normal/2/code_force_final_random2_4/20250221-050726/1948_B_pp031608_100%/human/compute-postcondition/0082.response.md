Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[-1]` followed by `arr[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is explicitly set to `False` by the given code.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `_`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition about `nums` being sorted or not does not affect the current state since the code only sets `ans` to `False` and does not include any conditional logic to check the sorting of `nums`.
