Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by the integer `arr[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the string representation of the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits (each digit as an integer) and then appending the integer `arr[i]` to this list.
- The value of `i` is `m - 2`, so `arr[i - 1]` refers to the element at index `m - 3` in the list `arr`, and `arr[i]` refers to the element at index `m - 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `_`, `arr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
