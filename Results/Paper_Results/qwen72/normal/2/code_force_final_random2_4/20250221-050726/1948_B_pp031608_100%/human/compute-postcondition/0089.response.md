Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent checks were met during the loop execution. If any iteration found `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` was not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. The elements of `arr` may have been modified based on the conditions within the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases and is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: For each test case, `m` is an input integer that represents the length of the array `arr`. It is read from input and remains unchanged within the loop.
- **`_`**: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop and does not affect the state.
- **`arr`**: This is a list of integers derived from the input. The elements of `arr` may be modified if the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met and the resulting `nums` list is sorted.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be 0 because the inner loop runs from `m - 1` down to 1.
- **`ans`**: This variable is set to `False` if any element `arr[i]` is found to be less than `arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list is not sorted. Otherwise, `ans` remains `True`. The final value of `ans` is printed after each test case.

This output state reflects the final conditions of the variables after all iterations of the loop have completed.
