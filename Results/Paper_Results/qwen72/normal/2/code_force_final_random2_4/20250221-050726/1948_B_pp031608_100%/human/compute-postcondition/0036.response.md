The code snippet converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and then appends the integer `arr[i]` to this list, storing the result in the variable `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
- `_` is a placeholder
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is True
- The current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`

Let's assume `arr[i - 1]` is 123 and `arr[i]` is 45 (these are just example values to illustrate the process).

1. `str(arr[i - 1])` converts `arr[i - 1]` to a string, resulting in "123".
2. `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` converts each character in the string "123" to an integer, resulting in the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` appends `arr[i]` to the list `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 45]`.

Therefore, the variable `nums` is assigned the list `[1, 2, 3, 45]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]`.**
