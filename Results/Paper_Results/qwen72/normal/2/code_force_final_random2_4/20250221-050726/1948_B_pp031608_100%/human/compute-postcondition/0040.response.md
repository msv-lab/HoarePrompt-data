Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
