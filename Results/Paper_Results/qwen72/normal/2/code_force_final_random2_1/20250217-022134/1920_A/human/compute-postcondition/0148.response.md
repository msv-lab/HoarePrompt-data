To determine what will be printed by the `print(num)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is the last element in `no`.
   - `no` must contain at least one integer.
   - `iterable` is `k + 1`.
   - `loop` must be greater than `k + 1`.
   - `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2.
   - `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1.
   - `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the number of elements in `no` that satisfy `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`.
   - `innerLoop` is the number of iterations executed.
   - `x` and `a` are integers provided by user input during each iteration.
   - If `num` is less than 1, the current value of `num` remains less than 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i`: The last element in the list `no`.
   - `no`: A list of integers with at least one element.
   - `less`: A list of integers where `x` was 2.
   - `big`: A list of integers where `x` was 1.
   - `num`: Calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the count of elements in `no` that satisfy `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`.

3. **Calculating `num`:**
   - `min(less)`: The minimum value in the list `less`.
   - `max(big)`: The maximum value in the list `big`.
   - `min(less) - max(big) + 1`: This is the initial part of the calculation for `num`.
   - Count of elements in `no` that satisfy `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`: This is the number of elements in `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count_of_elements_in_no_satisfying_condition`

5. **Output:**
   - The value of `num` will be printed. If `num` is less than 1, it will remain less than 1.

Given the complexity and the dependencies on user inputs (`x` and `a`), we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `num` without specific values for `less`, `big`, and `no`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **num (where num is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the number of elements in `no` that satisfy `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, and if num is less than 1, it remains less than 1)**
