The code snippet `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. The initial state includes the following conditions:

- `i` is the first element of `no`.
- `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2.
- `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.

Since the code only affects the value of `num`, the other conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`i` is the first element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, and `num` is decreased by 1.**
