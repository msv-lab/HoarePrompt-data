The code `less.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `less`. Depending on the initial conditions, the state of the lists `less`, `big`, and `no` will vary. Here’s the detailed calculation:

- If `x` is 1:
  - `big` is a list containing `[a, a]`.
  - `less` and `no` are empty lists.
  - After executing `less.append(a)`, `less` will contain `[a]`.

- If `x` is 2:
  - `less` is a list containing `[a, a]`.
  - `big` is a list containing `[a]`.
  - `no` is an empty list.
  - After executing `less.append(a)`, `less` will contain `[a, a, a]`.

- If `x` is neither 1 nor 2:
  - `less` is a list containing `[a]`.
  - `big` is a list containing `[a]`.
  - `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.
  - After executing `less.append(a)`, `less` will contain `[a, a]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, if `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `[a, a]`, and `less` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is an empty list, if `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a, a, a]`, and `big` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is an empty list, otherwise, `less` is a list containing `[a, a]`, and `big` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**
