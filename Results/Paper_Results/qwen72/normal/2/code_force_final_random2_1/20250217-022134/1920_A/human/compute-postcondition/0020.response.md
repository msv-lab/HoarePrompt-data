The code `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `big`. Given the initial conditions, the specific changes and their implications are as follows:

- If `x` is 1, `big` already contains the value of `a`. After executing `big.append(a)`, `big` will contain two instances of `a`.
- If `x` is 2, `big` is initially an empty list. After executing `big.append(a)`, `big` will contain one instance of `a`.
- If `x` is any other value, `big` is initially an empty list. After executing `big.append(a)`, `big` will contain one instance of `a`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is a specific input integer, `a` is a specific input integer, if `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `[a, a]`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists, if `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, and `big` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is an empty list, otherwise, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`, and `big` is a list containing `[a]`.**
