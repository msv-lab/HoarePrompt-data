The value of `num` is decremented by 1. The values of `i`, `no`, and `x` remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is the third element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and `no` must have at least 3 elements, these conditions remain valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`i` is the third element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and `no` must have at least 3 elements, `num` is decreased by 1.**
