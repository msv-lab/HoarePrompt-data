The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a set of constraints. The function likely accepts these parameters through some form of input mechanism (e.g., arguments, file input, etc.), but this is not specified in the function signature.

Each test case is defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair (a, x), where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). Each test case must contain at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, ensuring a finite solution set. No two constraints are the same within a test case.

The function's output is not explicitly defined, but it is expected to process these constraints and produce a result based on the constraints provided for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). Each test case must include at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, ensuring a finite solution set. No two constraints are the same within a test case. The function returns a result based on the processing of these constraints for each test case.**
