Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 1. Additionally, the current value of `x` is 2.**
