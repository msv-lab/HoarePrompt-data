Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is a specific input integer, `a` is a specific input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `[a, a]`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a, a]`, and `big` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, and `big` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.***
