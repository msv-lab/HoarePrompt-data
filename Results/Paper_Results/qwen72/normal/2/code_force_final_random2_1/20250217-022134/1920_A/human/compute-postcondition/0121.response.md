Output State: **`i` is undefined, `no` contains the integer `a`, `iterable` is `k + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `k + 1`, `less` is an empty list if `x` is not 2, otherwise `less` contains the integer `a`, `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is `k + 2`, `innerLoop` must be greater than `k + 2`, `x` and `a` are integers provided by user input, and `x` is either 1 or not 1.**
