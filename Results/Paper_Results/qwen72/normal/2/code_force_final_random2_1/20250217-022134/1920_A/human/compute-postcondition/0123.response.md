Postcondition: ***`i` is undefined, `iterable` is `k + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `k + 1`, `iterable2` is `k + 2`, `innerLoop` must be greater than `k + 2`, `num` is 0, `x` and `a` are integers provided by user input, and `x` is either 1 or not 1. If `x` is 1, `no` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `big` contains the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, `no` is an empty list, `less` contains the integer `a`, and `big` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains the integer `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `big` is an empty list.***
