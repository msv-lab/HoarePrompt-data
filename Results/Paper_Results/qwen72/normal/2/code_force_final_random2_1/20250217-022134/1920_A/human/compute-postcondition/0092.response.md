The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `no`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `no`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to the next element in the list `no`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the first element of `no`.
- `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to the second element of `no`, assuming `no` has at least two elements.

State: **`i` is the second element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.**
