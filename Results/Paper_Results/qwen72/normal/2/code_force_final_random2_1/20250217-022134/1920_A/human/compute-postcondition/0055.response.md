Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is an empty list, `i` is undefined, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list.** 

The code snippet sets the variable `num` to 0, overriding its previous value which was `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
