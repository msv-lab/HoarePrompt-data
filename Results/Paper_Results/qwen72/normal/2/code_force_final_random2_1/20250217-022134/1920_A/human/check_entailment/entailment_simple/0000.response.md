Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the number of constraints (`n`) for each test case. It also reads the constraints and categorizes them into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1 (k ≥ x), `less` for constraints of type 2 (k ≤ x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k ≠ x).

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - The program calculates the minimum value from the `less` list and the maximum value from the `big` list. This is correct because the valid range for `k` is `[max(big), min(less)]`.
   - The program then calculates the number of integers in this range using `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This is the correct formula to count the number of integers in a closed interval.

3. **Exclusion of Specific Values**:
   - The program iterates over the `no` list to exclude any values that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. This is necessary because these values should not be included in the final count.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the calculated number of integers (`num`) is less than 1, the program correctly prints 0. This handles cases where the constraints are contradictory (e.g., k ≥ 5 and k ≤ 4).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final count of valid integers for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly and produces the expected results for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
