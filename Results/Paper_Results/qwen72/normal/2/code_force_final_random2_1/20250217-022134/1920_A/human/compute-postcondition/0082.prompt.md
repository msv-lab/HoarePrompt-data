Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is an empty list, `i` is undefined, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is the first integer read from input, `a` is the second integer read from input, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `i` is undefined, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is the first integer read from input, `a` is the second integer read from input, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `i` is undefined, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` twice if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is a list containing the value of `a` once if `x` is 2 and remains unchanged otherwise, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` twice if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is a list containing the value of `a` once if `x` is 1 and remains an empty list otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is 3, `a` is 7, `no` is [7] or [7, 7], `i` is undefined, `less` is [7] if `x` == 2, otherwise `less` remains unchanged, `big` is [7] if `x` == 1, otherwise `big` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
