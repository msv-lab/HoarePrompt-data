Postcondition: ***`i` is undefined, `no` is a list that may contain the integer `a` if `x` is not 2, `iterable` is `k + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `k + 1`, `less` is a list that contains the integer `a` if `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `x` and `a` are integers provided by user input, and `x` is not equal to 1.***
