The value of `a` (which is 7) is appended to the list `no`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is 3, `a` is 7, `no` is [7, 7], `i` is undefined, `less` remains unchanged, `big` remains an empty list.**
