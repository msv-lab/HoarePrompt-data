You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `tot` is the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the elements in `nums` minus the sum of the even-indexed elements in `cntvals`, `cntvals` is a list of zero counts of each element in `nums`, sorted in descending order, and `i` is the largest even index less than the length of `cntvals`.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the elements in `nums` minus the sum of the even-indexed elements in `cntvals` (which is a list of zero counts of each element in `nums`, sorted in descending order) is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of integers in the list), `m` (a non-negative integer representing the threshold for Sasha's win condition), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). It returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the elements in `nums` minus the sum of the even-indexed elements in `cntvals` (a list of zero counts of each element in `nums`, sorted in descending order) is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna'. If `n` is 1, it returns 'Anna' if the length of the string representation of the minimum of `n` and its reverse is less than `m + 1`; otherwise, it returns 'Sasha'.

        tot += 1
        
    #State: `num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 10^9, `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`, and `i` is the index of the first non-zero digit from the right, or -1 if all digits are zero.
    return tot
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `zerocnts` accepts an integer `num` within the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9 and returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`. After the function concludes, `num` remains unchanged, and the returned value represents the count of consecutive zeros at the end of the string representation of `num`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Base Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the base case where `n == 1`. If there is only one number in the list, Sasha will win if the length of the number (or its reversed form) is at least `m + 1`. This is because the game ends immediately after Anna's first move, and Sasha checks if the remaining number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

2. **Total Digit Count Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the total number of digits in the list using `sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`. This is correct as it sums up the lengths of all numbers in the list.

3. **Counting Leading Zeros:**
   - The function `zerocnts` is used to count the number of trailing zeros in each number. This is done by converting the number to a string and iterating from the end to find the first non-zero digit. The count of trailing zeros is returned.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The function `func_1` then sorts the counts of trailing zeros in descending order and iterates over them in steps of 2, subtracting the counts from the total digit count. This simulates Sasha's strategy of concatenating pairs of numbers, which reduces the total number of digits in the list.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - After processing all the numbers, the function checks if the remaining total digit count is at least `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `m = 2`, `nums = [14, 2]`
  - Anna can reverse `2` to get `2`, and Sasha can concatenate `2` and `14` to get `214` (or `142`), which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Sasha wins.
  - Output: `Sasha`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 3`, `m = 5`, `nums = [9, 56, 1]`
  - Anna can reverse `56` to get `65`, and Sasha can concatenate `65` and `9` to get `659` (or `965`), which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 10`, `nums = [1, 2007, 800, 1580]`
  - Anna can reverse `2007` to get `7002`, and Sasha can concatenate `7002` and `800` to get `7002800` (or `8007002`), which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Sasha wins.
  - Output: `Sasha`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 5`, `nums = [5000, 123, 30, 4]`
  - Anna can reverse `5000` to get `5`, and Sasha can concatenate `5` and `123` to get `5123` (or `1235`), which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `n = 10`, `m = 10`, `nums = [6, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 10, 9, 10, 7]`
  - Anna can reverse `10` to get `1`, and Sasha can concatenate `1` and `10` to get `110` (or `101`), which is less than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `nums = [6]`
  - Sasha wins if the length of `6` (or its reversed form) is at least `2`. Since `6` has only one digit, Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `nums = [10]`
  - Sasha wins if the length of `10` (or its reversed form) is at least `2`. Since `10` has two digits, Sasha wins.
  - Output: `Sasha`

- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `n = 8`, `m = 9`, `nums = [1, 2, 9, 10, 10, 2, 10, 2]`
  - Anna can reverse `10` to get `1`, and Sasha can concatenate `1` and `10` to get `110` (or `101`), which is less than \(10^9 = 1000000000\). Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 5`, `nums = [10, 10, 10, 10]`
  - Anna can reverse `10` to get `1`, and Sasha can concatenate `1` and `10` to get `110` (or `101`), which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`
