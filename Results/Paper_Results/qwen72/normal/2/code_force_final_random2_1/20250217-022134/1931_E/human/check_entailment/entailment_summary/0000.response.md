### Reasoning:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly handles the base case where `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it checks if the length of the string representation of the single number (or its reverse) is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. This is correct because if the single number is large enough, Sasha wins immediately; otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **General Case**:
   - **Sum of Digits Lengths**: The function calculates the total length of the string representations of all numbers in the list. This is done using `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`.
   - **Trailing Zeros Calculation**: The function `zerocnts` is used to calculate the number of trailing zeros in each number. This is important because trailing zeros do not contribute to the length of the number when concatenated.
   - **Adjusting Total Length**: The function then subtracts the number of trailing zeros (from the `cntvals` list, sorted in descending order) from the total length `tot` in steps of 2. This simulates Sasha's optimal strategy of removing pairs of numbers with the most trailing zeros first, which minimizes the length of the resulting number.
   - **Win Condition**: Finally, the function checks if the adjusted total length `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Anna's optimal strategy is to reverse the smallest number possible to minimize the impact on the total length.
   - Sasha's optimal strategy is to concatenate pairs of numbers with the most trailing zeros first to minimize the length of the resulting number.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1.
   - The function also handles cases where the numbers have many trailing zeros, which are correctly accounted for in the `zerocnts` function.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the given problem description and the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, the program is correct.
