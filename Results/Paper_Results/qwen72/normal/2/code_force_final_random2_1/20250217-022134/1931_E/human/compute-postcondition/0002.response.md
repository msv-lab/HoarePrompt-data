To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range` function is defined as `range(start, stop, step)`, where:
   - `start` is `len(num) - 1`
   - `stop` is `-1`
   - `step` is `-1`

3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute, the `start` value must be greater than or equal to the `stop` value. In this case, `len(num) - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Initial State**:
   - `num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 10^9.
   - `tot` is 0.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `len(num)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute (since `len(num) - 1` must be non-negative).
   - `i` should start at `len(num) - 1`.

### Final State:
Given the initial state and the loop head, the necessary adjustments are:
- `num` must be a string with at least one character.
- `i` should start at `len(num) - 1`.

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 10^9, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
