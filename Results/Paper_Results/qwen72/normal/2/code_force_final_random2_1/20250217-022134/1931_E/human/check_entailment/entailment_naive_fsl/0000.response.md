Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function incorrectly uses `n` instead of the elements in `nums` when checking the length of the reversed number. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
2 2
14 2
```
According to the problem description, Anna can reverse either 14 or 2. If she reverses 14, it becomes 41, and if she reverses 2, it remains 2. In either case, Sasha can concatenate the two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to 100 (e.g., 412 or 214). Therefore, Sasha should win.

However, the provided code incorrectly checks the length of `n` (which is 2) instead of the elements in `nums`. This leads to an incorrect result:
```python
func_1(2, 2, [14, 2])
```
The function returns 'Anna' instead of 'Sasha', which is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should correctly handle the reversal and comparison of the elements in `nums` rather than using `n`.
