Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function `func_1` starts by checking if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it returns 'Sasha' if the length of the string representation of the minimum of `n` and its reverse is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. This part is incorrect because it should check the length of the string representation of the single element in `nums`, not `n` itself. The correct check should be `len(str(min(nums)))`.

2. **Sum of Digits Lengths**: The function calculates the total sum of the lengths of the string representations of the elements in `nums`. This is correct as it accurately reflects the total number of digits in the list.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**: The function `zerocnts` correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of a number. This is used to adjust the total digit count appropriately.

4. **Adjusting Total Digits**: The function subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the total digit count. This is done by iterating over the `cntvals` list in steps of 2, which is intended to simulate the removal of pairs of numbers by Sasha. However, the logic here is flawed because it does not account for the fact that Sasha can choose any two numbers, not just those with the most trailing zeros.

5. **Final Decision**: The function returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted total digit count is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'. This part is conceptually correct but relies on the flawed logic of the previous step.

Given the issues identified, particularly in the initial check and the adjustment of the total digit count, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
