You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
from collections import Counter
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    if n == 1:
        return 'Sasha' if len(str(min(n, int(str(n)[::-1])))) >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

    tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

#Function 2:
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `zerocnts` accepts an integer `num` within the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9 and returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`. After the function concludes, `num` remains unchanged, and the returned value represents the count of consecutive zeros at the end of the string representation of `num`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function incorrectly uses `n` instead of the elements in `nums` when checking the length of the reversed number. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
2 2
14 2
```
According to the problem description, Anna can reverse either 14 or 2. If she reverses 14, it becomes 41, and if she reverses 2, it remains 2. In either case, Sasha can concatenate the two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to 100 (e.g., 412 or 214). Therefore, Sasha should win.

However, the provided code incorrectly checks the length of `n` (which is 2) instead of the elements in `nums`. This leads to an incorrect result:
```python
func_1(2, 2, [14, 2])
```
The function returns 'Anna' instead of 'Sasha', which is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should correctly handle the reversal and comparison of the elements in `nums` rather than using `n`.
