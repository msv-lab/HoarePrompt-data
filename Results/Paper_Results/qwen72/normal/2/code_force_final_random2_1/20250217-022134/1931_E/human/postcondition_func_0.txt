The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of integers in the list), `m` (a non-negative integer representing the threshold for Sasha's win condition), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). It returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the elements in `nums` minus the sum of the even-indexed elements in `cntvals` (a list of zero counts of each element in `nums`, sorted in descending order) is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna'. If `n` is 1, it returns 'Anna' if the length of the string representation of the minimum of `n` and its reverse is less than `m + 1`; otherwise, it returns 'Sasha'.
