Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
