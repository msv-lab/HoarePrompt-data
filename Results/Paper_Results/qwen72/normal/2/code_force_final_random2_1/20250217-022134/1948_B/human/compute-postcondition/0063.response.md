To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `m`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range(m - 1, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence starting from `m - 1` down to 1 (inclusive) with a step of -1.
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of the range (`m - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the stopping value (1). This means `m - 1 >= 1`, which simplifies to `m >= 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`m`**: Ensure `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.
- **`i`**: The initial value of `i` should be `m - 1` when the loop starts.

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 1 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `_` is 2 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `m` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the new input (not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is 0 (needs to be adjusted).
- `ans` is True (not relevant to the loop head).

### Adjusted State:
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` should be `m - 1` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is True**.
