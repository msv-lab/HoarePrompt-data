#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The function should determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by applying the specified operation any number of times.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is `n-1`, `m` is the input integer for the last test case, `arr` is a list of integers from the last input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent checks were met during the loop execution. If any iteration found `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list was not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. The elements of `arr` may have been modified according to the rules specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` representing the length of an array, followed by `m` integers forming the array. The function determines if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly performing an operation that splits an element into its digits and rearranges them. The function prints "YES" if the array can be sorted this way, and "NO" otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
