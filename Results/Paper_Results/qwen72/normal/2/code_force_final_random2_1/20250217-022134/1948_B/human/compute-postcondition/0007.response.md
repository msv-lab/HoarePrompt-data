The code snippet `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` converts the integer at `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and appends the integer at `arr[i]` to this list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `m` must be at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input
- `ans` is True
- `i` is `m - 1`
- The current value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `arr[i - 1]` is converted to a string and each character (digit) is converted back to an integer.
2. These integers are collected into a list.
3. The integer at `arr[i]` is appended to this list.
4. The resulting list is assigned to `nums`.

Since `i` is `m - 1`, the value of `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[m - 2]` and the value of `arr[i]` is `arr[m - 1]`.

For example, if `arr[m - 2]` is 123 and `arr[m - 1]` is 45, then:
- `str(arr[m - 2])` is "123"
- `[int(i) for i in "123"]` results in `[1, 2, 3]`
- `[1, 2, 3] + [45]` results in `[1, 2, 3, 45]`

Therefore, `nums` will be `[1, 2, 3, 45]` in this example.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[m - 2]` followed by `arr[m - 1]`.**
