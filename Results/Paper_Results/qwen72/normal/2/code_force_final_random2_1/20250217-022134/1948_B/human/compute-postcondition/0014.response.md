The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `m`. The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `m - 2`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be greater than `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged as it's not part of the loop head).
- `_` is 0 (unchanged as it's not part of the loop head).
- `m` is at least 2 (unchanged as it's not part of the loop head).
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input (unchanged as it's not part of the loop head).
- `i` is `m - 1`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` is now `m - 2`.
- The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `i` must be greater than 0**
