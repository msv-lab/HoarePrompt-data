To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) determined by the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and subsequent checks during the loop execution.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The variable `ans` is set to `True` initially.
   - During the loop execution, if any iteration finds that `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False`.
   - If no such condition is met, `ans` remains `True`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement uses a list indexing approach to select between 'NO' and 'YES' based on the value of `ans`.
   - If `ans` is `True`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][True]`, which is `['NO', 'YES'][1]` (since `True` is equivalent to 1 in Python), resulting in 'YES'.
   - If `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][False]`, which is `['NO', 'YES'][0]` (since `False` is equivalent to 0 in Python), resulting in 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the final output depends on the value of `ans` after the loop execution. Since the exact sequence of `arr` and the loop logic are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the possible values of `ans`.

Output: **'YES' if `ans` is `True`, 'NO' if `ans` is `False` (where `ans` is determined by the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and subsequent checks during the loop execution)**
