To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `m` is greater than 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ans` is either `True` or `False` depending on the following conditions:
     - `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums != sorted(nums)` were met during any iteration.
     - If `ans` is `False`, the loop broke early due to the unsorted `nums` condition.
     - Otherwise, the loop completed all iterations with `ans` remaining `True`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The list `['NO', 'YES']` contains two strings: `'NO'` and `'YES'`.
   - The index `[ans]` is used to select one of these strings.
   - If `ans` is `True`, the index will be 1, and `'YES'` will be selected.
   - If `ans` is `False`, the index will be 0, and `'NO'` will be selected.

4. **Determination of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is determined by the conditions mentioned in the initial state.
   - If the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums != sorted(nums)` was met during any iteration, `ans` will be `False`.
   - If the loop completed all iterations without breaking early, `ans` will be `True`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `ans` is `True`, the output will be `'YES'`.
   - If `ans` is `False`, the output will be `'NO'`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **'YES' if `ans` is True, 'NO' if `ans` is False**.
