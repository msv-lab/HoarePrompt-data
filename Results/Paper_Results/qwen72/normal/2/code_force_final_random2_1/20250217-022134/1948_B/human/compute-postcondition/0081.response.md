Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by the integer `arr[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated from True to False.
- All other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `nums`) retain their initial values and conditions.
