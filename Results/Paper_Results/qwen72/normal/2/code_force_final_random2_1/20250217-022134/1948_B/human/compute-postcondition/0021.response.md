To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the loop head).
- `m` is at least 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `m - 2`.
- `i` must be greater than 0.
- If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.
- If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Additionally, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.
- If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to the variables.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `m - 1` to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 2`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making it `m - 3`.

### Adjustments:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- Since `i` is currently `m - 2`, it will be decremented to `m - 3` for the next iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
- `i` is `m - 3`.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `nums`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, and `i` must be greater than 0.**
