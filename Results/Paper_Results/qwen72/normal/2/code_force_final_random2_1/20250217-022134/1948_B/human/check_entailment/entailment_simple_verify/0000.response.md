Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed fails to handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when it comes to recursively checking the entire array after each split. The provided counterexample clearly demonstrates this issue:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3
  12 28 5
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  NO
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  YES
  ```

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - The array is `[12, 28, 5]`.
   - The program starts by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning.

2. **First Iteration (i = 2):**
   - `arr[2] = 5` and `arr[1] = 28`.
   - Since `5 < 28`, the program splits `28` into `[2, 8]` and appends `5` to the list, resulting in `[2, 8, 5]`.
   - The program then sets `arr[1] = 2` (the first digit of `28`).

3. **Array After First Split:**
   - The array becomes `[12, 2, 8, 5]`.

4. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
   - `arr[1] = 2` and `arr[0] = 12`.
   - Since `2 < 12`, the program splits `12` into `[1, 2]` and appends `2` to the list, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
   - The program then sets `arr[0] = 1` (the first digit of `12`).

5. **Array After Second Split:**
   - The array becomes `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.

6. **Final Check:**
   - The program does not check the entire array again to ensure it is sorted. It only checks the immediate next element and stops if it finds the array is not sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to recursively check the entire array after each split, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
