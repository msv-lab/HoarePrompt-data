Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to `True`. This overrides the initial state where `ans` was either `True` or `False` based on certain conditions. All other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects these unchanged variables along with the updated value of `ans`.
