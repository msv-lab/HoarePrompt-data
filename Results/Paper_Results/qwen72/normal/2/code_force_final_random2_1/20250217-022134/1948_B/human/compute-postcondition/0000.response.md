The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This impacts the value of `n` but does not affect any other part of the initial state.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The function should determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by applying the specified operation any number of times. `n` is an input integer.**
