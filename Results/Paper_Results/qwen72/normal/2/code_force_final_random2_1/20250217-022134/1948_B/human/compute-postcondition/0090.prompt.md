You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The function should determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by applying the specified operation any number of times.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is `n-1`, `m` is the input integer for the last test case, `arr` is a list of integers from the last input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent checks were met during the loop execution. If any iteration found `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list was not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. The elements of `arr` may have been modified according to the rules specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers. It returns `True` if it is possible to sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order by performing a specified operation any number of times, and `False` otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
