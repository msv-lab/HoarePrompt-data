The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers. The integer `n` represents the length of the array `a`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`. Each element `a_i` in the array `a` is an integer within the range `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99`. The function determines whether it is possible to sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order by performing a specified operation any number of times. The function returns `True` if it is possible to sort the array in this manner, and `False` otherwise.
