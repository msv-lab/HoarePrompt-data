The code snippet `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` performs the following actions:

1. It converts the integer at `arr[i - 1]` to a string, iterates over each character in this string, converts each character back to an integer, and creates a list of these integers.
2. It appends the integer at `arr[i]` to the end of this list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `m` is greater than 1
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is 0
- `ans` is True

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

- Since `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` would access `arr[-1]`, which is the last element of the list `arr`.
- The last element of `arr` is converted to a string, and each digit of this string is converted back to an integer, forming a list.
- The first element of `arr` (since `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is `arr[0]`) is appended to this list.

Therefore, the new list `nums` is created as follows:
- `nums` is a list containing the digits of the last element of `arr` followed by the first element of `arr`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the last element of `arr` followed by the first element of `arr`.**
