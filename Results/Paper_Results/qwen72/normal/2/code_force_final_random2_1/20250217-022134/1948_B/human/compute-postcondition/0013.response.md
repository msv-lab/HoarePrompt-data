Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 1`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the current value of `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[m - 2]` followed by `arr[m - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
