Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by checking if it's possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits. However, the logic used in the program has some flaws:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program attempts to split an element only when it finds that the current element is less than the previous one. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of splitting multiple elements or elements that are not adjacent but still need to be split to achieve a sorted array.

2. **Incorrect Check for Sorted Array**: The program checks if the digits of the element being split are sorted, but it does not ensure that the entire array is sorted after the split. It only checks the immediate neighbors, which is insufficient.

3. **Early Termination**: The program breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a case where the array cannot be sorted by splitting the current element. This might lead to incorrect results if a different sequence of splits could have led to a sorted array.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
