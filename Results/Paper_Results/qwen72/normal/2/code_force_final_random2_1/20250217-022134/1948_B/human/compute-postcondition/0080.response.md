Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by the integer `arr[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums` is calculated by converting each digit of the integer `arr[i - 1]` to an integer and forming a list from these digits. This list is then concatenated with a list containing the single element `arr[i]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
