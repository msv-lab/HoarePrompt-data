Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `i` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
