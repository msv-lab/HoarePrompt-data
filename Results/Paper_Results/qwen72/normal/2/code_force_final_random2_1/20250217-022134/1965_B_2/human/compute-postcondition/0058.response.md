To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `nums`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first input positive integer.
- `k` is the second input positive integer.
- `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- `idx` is -1.
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition `i < len(nums)` must still hold true.

Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The length of `nums` is 21 (since it contains 21 elements from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `i` is 1**.
