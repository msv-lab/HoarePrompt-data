Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 that must have at least one element, `idx` is 0, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `idx = i - 1` changes the value of `idx` from -1 to 0, since `i` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
