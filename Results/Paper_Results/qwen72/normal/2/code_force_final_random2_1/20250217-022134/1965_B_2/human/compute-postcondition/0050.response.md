The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This operation updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the user's input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is an input positive integer
- `k` is an input positive integer
- `nums` is a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, followed by `k + 1`, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but without the element `1 << idx`
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists
- `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists (potentially updated if the removed element was the first element greater than `k`)

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is updated to the first integer input by the user
- `k` is updated to the second integer input by the user

The rest of the variables (`t`, `nums`, `idx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, followed by `k + 1`, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but without the element `1 << idx`, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists (potentially updated if the removed element was the first element greater than `k`).**
