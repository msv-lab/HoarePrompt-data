The code `nums.append(k - nums[idx])` appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Here, `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists. This means that `nums[idx]` is the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **`nums`**: The list `nums` now includes an additional element, which is `k - nums[idx]`.
2. **`idx`**: The value of `idx` remains the same, as it was determined before the code execution.
3. **`i`**: The value of `i` remains the same, as it was determined before the code execution.
4. **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged.
5. **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged.
6. **`k`**: The value of `k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`], `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists, `i` is the index of the first number in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such number exists.**
