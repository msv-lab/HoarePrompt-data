Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 that must have at least one element, `idx` is 0, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `idx`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
