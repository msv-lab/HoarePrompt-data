Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]` generates a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This means `nums` is now `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The value of `idx` remains the same as it was initially defined: the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists.
- The value of `i` remains the same as it was initially defined: the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.
