The code snippet `nums.append(k + 1)` appends the value `k + 1` to the list `nums`. This impacts the list `nums` by adding a new element at the end. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Let's break down the changes:

- `nums` is initially a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended.
- After the code executes, `nums` will have one more element, which is `k + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is the first input positive integer
- `k` is the second input positive integer
- `nums` is now a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with two additional elements: `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (before appending) that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power of 2 exists
- `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` (before appending) that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` (before appending) if no such element exists

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with two additional elements: `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (before appending) that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power of 2 exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` (before appending) that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` (before appending) if no such element exists.**
