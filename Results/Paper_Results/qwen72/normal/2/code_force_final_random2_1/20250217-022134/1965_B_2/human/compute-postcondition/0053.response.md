To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `nums`.
- The loop will execute if `len(nums)` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is the first input positive integer
- `k` is the second input positive integer
- `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)
- `idx` is -1
- `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists

For the loop to execute:
- `i` must be within the range of `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

Since `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), it always contains 21 elements. Therefore, `len(nums)` is always 21, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

However, the initial value of `i` is determined by the condition "the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists." To ensure the loop executes, `i` should be set to 0, as this is the starting point for the loop.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `i` is 0**
