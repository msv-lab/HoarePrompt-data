Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is 0, `i` is 1. If `nums[1]` (which is 2) is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1 and `i` remains 1.***
