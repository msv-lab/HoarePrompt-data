Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 that must have at least one element, `idx` is -1, `i` is 0, `idx` is -1, and the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The code `idx = i - 1` sets the value of `idx` to `i - 1`. Since `i` is 0, `idx` becomes -1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `idx` while maintaining the initial state of all other variables and conditions.
