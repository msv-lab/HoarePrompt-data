Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 that must have at least two elements, `i` is 2, `idx` is 1**.

Explanation: The value of `idx` is updated to `i - 1`. Since `i` is 2, `idx` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
