Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
    idx = -1
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > k:
            idx = i - 1
            break
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1]` with the element `1 << idx` removed, `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists, `i` is the index of `k + 1` in the updated list `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, followed by `k + 1`, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but without the element `1 << idx`, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists (potentially updated if the removed element was the first element greater than `k`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is the list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) removed and the three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (before appending) that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power of 2 exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` (before appending) that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` (before appending) if no such element exists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
