### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `func_1`.
   - It reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists of prices `a` and `b` using `func_2`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - The program creates a list `combined` that pairs the negative of Alice's prices with Bob's prices.
   - This list is sorted based on Bob's prices in ascending order. This is crucial because Bob will take the `k` items with the lowest Bob prices for free, and Alice will want to maximize the profit from the remaining items.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap is used to keep track of the top `k` items that Bob will take for free.
   - The first `k` items from the sorted `combined` list are pushed into the heap. This ensures that the `k` items with the lowest Bob prices are selected.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3` calculates the total profit by summing up the profits from the items in the heap and the remaining items.
   - The program iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit and the heap to ensure that the top `k` items are always the ones Bob will take for free.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly updates the current profit by considering the effect of adding or removing items from the heap.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program ensures that Alice maximizes her profit by considering the best possible combination of items to buy and sell to Bob.
   - The use of a heap helps in efficiently managing the top `k` items that Bob will take for free, ensuring that the profit calculation is optimal.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when there are fewer than `k` items available.
   - The logic ensures that the profit is calculated correctly even when the number of items is small.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - Reads an integer from the input, which is the number of test cases.
  - This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - Reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.
  - This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
  - Calculates the total profit by summing up the profits from the items in the heap and the remaining items.
  - The logic inside the function is correct. It sums the first elements of the tuples in the heap and adds the sum of the first and second elements of the tuples in `primary_items` where the sum is non-negative.
  - This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
  - Handles the main logic of the program.
  - Initializes the heap and the remaining items.
  - Sorts the combined list of items based on Bob's prices.
  - Pushes the first `k` items into the heap.
  - Calls `func_3` to calculate the initial profit.
  - Iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit and the heap.
  - Prints the maximum profit for each test case.
  - This is correct and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the use of a heap ensures that the optimal strategy is followed for both Alice and Bob. The annotations and the original assessment are consistent with the correct implementation of the solution.

Final: **True**
