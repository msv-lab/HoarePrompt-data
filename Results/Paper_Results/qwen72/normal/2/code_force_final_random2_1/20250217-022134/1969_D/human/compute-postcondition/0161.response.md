Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements) in the order they were popped from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than the previous value of `max_profit`, `k` must be greater than 0, `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped, and `combined` now has one less element. Additionally, the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by the second element of `item`.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_profit -= item[1]` reduces the value of `current_profit` by the second element of `item`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `item[1]` is subtracted from `current_profit`, updating its value accordingly.
