The code snippet `combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))` creates a new list called `combined` by pairing elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. Each element in `combined` is a tuple consisting of one element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0
- `heap` is an empty list
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `max_profit` is 0
- `current_profit` is 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`.**
