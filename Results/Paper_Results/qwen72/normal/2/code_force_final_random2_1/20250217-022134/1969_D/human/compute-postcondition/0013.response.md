To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just the variable `_` and the value of `k`.

- The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and its initial value is not relevant to the loop's execution.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is greater than 0. The other variables and lists mentioned in the state do not affect the loop's ability to start.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, `k` must be greater than 0**
