### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_1` to read the number of test cases.
   - It uses `func_2` to read the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists of prices `a` and `b`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - The program creates a list `combined` that pairs the negative of Alice's prices with Bob's prices.
   - This list is sorted based on Bob's prices in ascending order.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap is used to keep track of the top `k` items that Bob will take for free.
   - The first `k` items from the sorted `combined` list are pushed into the heap.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3` calculates the total profit by summing up the profits from the items in the heap and the remaining items.
   - The program iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit and the heap to ensure that the top `k` items are always the ones Bob will take for free.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program ensures that Alice maximizes her profit by considering the best possible combination of items to buy and sell to Bob.
   - The use of a heap helps in efficiently managing the top `k` items that Bob will take for free, ensuring that the profit calculation is optimal.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when there are fewer than `k` items available.
   - The logic ensures that the profit is calculated correctly even when the number of items is small.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the use of a heap ensures that the optimal strategy is followed for both Alice and Bob.

Correctness: **True**
