Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped) plus the last `item` that was removed from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+2` elements shorter and must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was previously in the heap and has been replaced by `item`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the `current_profit` by subtracting the first element of `removed_item` from it. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state are still valid.
