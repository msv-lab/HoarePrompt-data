Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `current_profit = 0` sets the variable `current_profit` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial state specifies that `test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` and `remaining_items` are empty lists, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, and `max_profit` is 0. After executing the code snippet, `current_profit` is explicitly set to 0, which matches the output state.
