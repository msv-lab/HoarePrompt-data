Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k` elements shorter. If `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. Additionally, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**
