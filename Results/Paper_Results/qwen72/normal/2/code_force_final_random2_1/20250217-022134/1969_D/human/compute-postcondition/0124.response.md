Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped) plus the last `item` that was removed from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+3` elements shorter and must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was pushed out of `heap` when `item` was added, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is not None, and if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` updates the value of `current_profit` by subtracting the first element of `removed_item` from it.
- This operation only affects `current_profit` and does not change the values of other variables.
- If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated accordingly.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
