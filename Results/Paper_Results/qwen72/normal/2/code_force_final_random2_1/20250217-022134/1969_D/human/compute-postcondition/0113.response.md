Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped) plus the last `item` that was removed from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+2` elements shorter and must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was previously in the heap and has been replaced by `item`. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` was updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**
