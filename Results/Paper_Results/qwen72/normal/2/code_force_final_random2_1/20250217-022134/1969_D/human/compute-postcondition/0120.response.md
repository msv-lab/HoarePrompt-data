The code snippet `current_profit -= item[1]` updates the value of `current_profit` by subtracting the second element of the tuple `item` from `current_profit`.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0
- `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped) plus the last `item` that was removed from `combined`
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+3` elements shorter and must contain at least one element
- `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`
- If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged
- If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped) plus the last `item` that was removed from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+3` elements shorter and must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `current_profit` is `current_profit - item[1]`, if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]` otherwise `current_profit` remains unchanged, if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
