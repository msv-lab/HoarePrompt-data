Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit calculated during the loop, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is an empty list, and `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `prices = list(func_2())` updates the `prices` variable to be a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and `k` must be greater than 0 remains valid.
- The `neg_prices` list is still a list containing the negated values of `prices`, but the new `prices` list will affect its contents.
- The `bonuses` list is still a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, and this remains unchanged.
- The `max_profit` and `current_profit` variables retain their initial values.
- The `combined` list remains empty.
- The `heap` and `remaining_items` lists remain empty.
