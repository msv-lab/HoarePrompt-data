The code snippet `n, k = func_2()` assigns the values returned by the function `func_2()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the initial state does not specify what `func_2()` returns, we can only say that `n` and `k` are now assigned the values returned by `func_2()`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`.**
