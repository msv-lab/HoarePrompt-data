Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    heap = []
    remaining_items = []
    n, k = func_2()
    prices = list(func_2())
    neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
    bonuses = list(func_2())
    max_profit = 0
    current_profit = 0
    combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
    combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    for _ in range(k):
        if combined:
            heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
    if combined:
        current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit
    while combined:
        item = combined.pop()
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            current_profit -= item[1]
        else:
            current_profit += item[0]
        removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
        if removed_item:
            current_profit -= removed_item[0]
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
    print(max_profit)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit calculated during the loop, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is an empty list, and `k` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the entire process.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements) in the order they were popped from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop, and `k` must be greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
