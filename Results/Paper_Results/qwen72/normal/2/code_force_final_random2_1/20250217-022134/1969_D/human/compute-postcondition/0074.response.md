Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is an empty list, and `k` must be greater than 0.**

The code snippet `current_profit = 0` sets the variable `current_profit` to 0, which was already its initial value. Therefore, no changes occur in the state of the program, and all other conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
