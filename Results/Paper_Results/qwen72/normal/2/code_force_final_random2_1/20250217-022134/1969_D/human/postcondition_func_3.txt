`func_4` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` to determine the number of test cases. For each test case, it retrieves data using `func_2` and processes this data to calculate the maximum profit possible under certain conditions. The function uses a heap to manage and optimize the selection of items based on their prices and bonuses. After processing all test cases, the function prints the maximum profit for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies and processes the data internally.
