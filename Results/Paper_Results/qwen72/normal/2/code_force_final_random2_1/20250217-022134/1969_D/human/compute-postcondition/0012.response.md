The code snippet sorts the list `combined` based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the bonus values) in ascending order. This means that the tuples in `combined` will be rearranged such that the tuples with the smallest bonus values come first.

Since the sorting operation only affects the order of elements in `combined`, the values of other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order.**
