Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of calculating Alice's optimal profit when playing a game with Bob, considering the constraints and rules specified. Let's break down the correctness of each function and how they contribute to the overall solution:

1. **func_1**: This function reads an integer from the input, which is the number of test cases. It correctly handles the input and returns the integer value. This is essential for determining how many times the main logic needs to be executed.

2. **func_2**: This function reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a map object. It is used to read the values of `n`, `k`, `a_i`, and `b_i` for each test case. The function correctly processes the input and returns the necessary values.

3. **func_3**: This function calculates the total profit based on the items Alice can sell to Bob. It sums the first elements of all tuples in `secondary_heap` and adds the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `primary_items` where the sum is non-negative. This function is used to compute the profit for a given set of items and is crucial for the main logic.

4. **func_4**: This is the main function that processes each test case. It:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - Reads the prices `a_i` and bonuses `b_i`.
   - Combines these values into a list of tuples and sorts them.
   - Uses a heap to manage the selection of items to maximize profit.
   - Iterates through the combined list, updating the current profit and the maximum profit.
   - Prints the maximum profit for each test case.

The logic within `func_4` is designed to handle the constraints and rules of the game:
- Alice's profit is calculated based on the difference between the amount Bob pays and the amount Alice spends.
- Bob can take up to `k` items for free, and Alice needs to maximize her profit by choosing the optimal subset of items to buy and sell.

The use of a heap ensures that the most profitable items are considered first, and the algorithm correctly updates the profit based on the rules of the game.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle the constraints and rules of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
