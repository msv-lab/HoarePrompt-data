Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit calculated during the loop, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is an empty list, and `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]` creates a new list `neg_prices` where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in the `prices` list.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
- The condition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
