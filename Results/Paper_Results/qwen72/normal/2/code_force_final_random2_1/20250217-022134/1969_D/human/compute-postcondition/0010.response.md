Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `current_profit` to 0. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `current_profit`.
