Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `neg_prices` by iterating over each element in `prices` and negating it.
- The values of `test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged.
- The new list `neg_prices` contains the negated values of the elements in `prices`.
