Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, and `k` must be greater than 0. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` is now one element shorter.***
