Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped) plus the last `item` that was removed from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+3` elements shorter and must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was pushed out of `heap` when `item` was added, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or to `current_profit + item[0]` otherwise, and if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is further updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**

Explanation:
- The code `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to the current value of `current_profit`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
