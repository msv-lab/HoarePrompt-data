Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, and `i` is 1. If `a[1]` is less than `b[1]`, `f` is set to 1, and the second characters of `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, if `f` is 1 and `a[1]` is greater than `b[1]`, the second characters of `a` and `b` are swapped. If neither condition is met, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
