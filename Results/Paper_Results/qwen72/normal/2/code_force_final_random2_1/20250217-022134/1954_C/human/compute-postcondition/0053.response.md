The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the description, it seems to handle multiple test cases, each involving two integers `x` and `y`. The function processes these test cases and likely returns some result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case. However, without more specific information about the output, I can only infer the general structure.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

The function `func_1` is expected to process these test cases and produce some output. Since the exact output is not specified, I will assume the function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (where 1 <= x, y < 10^100 and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9). It processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
