Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(b) - 1`: This means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `b`.
- `a` is a list of characters with no elements remaining to be processed: This information is not directly relevant to the print statement, but it indicates that `a` is empty.
- `b` must have at least 2 elements: This ensures that `b` is not empty and has at least two elements, so `i` will be a valid index.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `i` is the index of the last element in the list `b`.

2. **Access the element at index `i` in `b`**:
   - The element at index `i` is the last element in the list `b`.

3. **Print the element**:
   - The `print` statement will print the last element of the list `b`.
   - The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline character is added after the printed element.

### Final Output:
The code will print the last element of the list `b` without adding a newline character.

Output: **last element of b (where b is a list with at least 2 elements)**
