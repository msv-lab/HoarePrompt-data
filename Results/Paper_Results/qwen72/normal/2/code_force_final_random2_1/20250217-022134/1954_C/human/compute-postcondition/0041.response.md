The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a` and the value of `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `a`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `a` is a list of characters with at least 1 element remaining. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 elements remaining.

State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements remaining**
