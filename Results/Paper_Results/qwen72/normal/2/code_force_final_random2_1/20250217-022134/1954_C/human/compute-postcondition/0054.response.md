Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes two input strings, `a` and `b`, which represent large integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. It ensures that no character in `a` is less than the corresponding character in `b` by swapping them if necessary. After processing, it prints the modified `a` and `b` strings, each followed by a newline. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the input strings according to the specified conditions. **
