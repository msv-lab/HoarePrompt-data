Based on the initial state where `i` is 0 and `a` is a non-empty list of characters, let's break down the execution of the `print` statement:

1. **Variable `i`**: It is set to 0.
2. **List `a`**: It is a non-empty list of characters. This means `a` contains at least one character.

When the `print` statement is executed:
- `a[i]` accesses the element at index 0 of the list `a`.
- The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline is added after the printed character, so the cursor remains on the same line.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the first character of the list `a`.

Output: **[first character of the list `a`]**
