Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(b)`: This means `i` is the length of the list `b`.
- `a` is a list of characters with no elements remaining to be processed: This means `a` is an empty list, but it does not affect the print statement directly.
- `b` must have at least 3 elements: This means `b` is a list with at least 3 elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is the length of `b`. If `b` has at least 3 elements, then `i` is at least 3.
- The `print` statement attempts to access `b[i]`, where `i` is the length of `b`.

In Python, list indices are zero-based, so the valid indices for a list `b` of length `n` are from `0` to `n-1`. Accessing `b[n]` (where `n` is the length of `b`) will result in an `IndexError` because it is out of bounds.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will raise an `IndexError` because `i` is equal to the length of `b`, and `b[i]` is out of bounds.

Output: **IndexError (list index out of range)**
