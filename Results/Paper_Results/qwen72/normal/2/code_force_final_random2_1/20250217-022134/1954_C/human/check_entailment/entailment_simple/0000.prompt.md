Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, x and y are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that has been modified such that no character in `a` is less than the corresponding character in `b` (if `f` was set to 1 during the loop), or `a` and `b` remain unchanged if no such condition was met. `b` is a list of characters from the new input string that may have been swapped with characters in `a`. `f` is 1 if any character in `a` was found to be less than the corresponding character in `b` and a swap occurred, otherwise `f` remains 0. The loop iterates through all characters in `a` and `b` up to the length of `a`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a list of characters with no elements remaining to be processed.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` is a list of characters with no elements remaining to be processed, `b` has been fully iterated over, and all its elements have been printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
