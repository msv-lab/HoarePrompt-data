Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping a prefix and a suffix. Specifically, the logic to check if the array can be split and rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence is not correctly implemented.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Check**: The initial check `check_all` correctly identifies if the array is already non-decreasing.
2. **Splitting Logic**: The logic to split the array and check if the resulting array is non-decreasing is flawed. The code only checks the first point where the array is not non-decreasing and then tries to split the array at that point. However, this approach does not consider all possible splits.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible splits and verifying if any of them result in a non-decreasing array. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-decreasing
        if all(a[i] <= a[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Find the first point where the array is not non-decreasing
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                # Check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting at this point
                new_a = a[i:] + a[:i]
                if all(new_a[j] <= new_a[j + 1] for j in range(n - 1)):
                    print('YES')
                    break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version:
1. First checks if the array is already non-decreasing.
2. If not, it finds the first point where the array is not non-decreasing.
3. It then checks if splitting the array at this point and swapping the parts results in a non-decreasing array.
4. If such a split is found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This approach ensures that all possible splits are considered, making the solution correct.
