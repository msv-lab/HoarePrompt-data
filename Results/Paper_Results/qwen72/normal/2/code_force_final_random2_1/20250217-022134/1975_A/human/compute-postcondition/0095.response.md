Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
- Additionally, `check_all_new` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the logic:

1. `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`.
2. `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
3. `check_all_new` is `True`, meaning all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
4. `new_all` is `True`, meaning all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
5. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order.

Since `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, it means that the list `new` meets the criteria of being in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`.

Given this, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print:

Output: **YES**
