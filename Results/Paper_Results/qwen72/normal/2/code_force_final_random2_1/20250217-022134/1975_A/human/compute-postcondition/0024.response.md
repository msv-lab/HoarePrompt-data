The code snippet `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` checks if the list `new` is non-decreasing. This means it verifies if each element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be at least 1
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing
- `i` is 2
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end
- `check_all_new` is the result of checking if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`

The code will compute `new_all` based on the condition that each element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element. The value of `new_all` will be `True` if the condition holds for all elements, and `False` otherwise.

Since the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`) are not modified by this code, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is the result of checking if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is the result of checking if `new` is non-decreasing.**
