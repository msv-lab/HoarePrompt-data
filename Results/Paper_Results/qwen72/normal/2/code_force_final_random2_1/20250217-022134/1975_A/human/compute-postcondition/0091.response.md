The code snippet `new = a[i:]` updates the variable `new` to be a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be at least 1
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is 1
- `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[0]`) is greater than `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`)
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index `n-1` to the end
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`

After executing the code snippet `new = a[i:]`:
- `new` is now a list containing elements from `a` starting from index `i` (which is 1) to the end of the list.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` must be at least 1
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is 1
- `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[0]`) is greater than `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`)
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**
