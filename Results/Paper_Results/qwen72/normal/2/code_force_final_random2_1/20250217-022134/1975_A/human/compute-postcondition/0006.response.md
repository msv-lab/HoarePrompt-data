Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is a throwaway variable, which means it's not used in the context of the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` and `a` is non-decreasing.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
