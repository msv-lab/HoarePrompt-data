The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array `a`.

Given these parameters, the function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information, but typically, such functions would return some form of analysis or computation based on the array `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
