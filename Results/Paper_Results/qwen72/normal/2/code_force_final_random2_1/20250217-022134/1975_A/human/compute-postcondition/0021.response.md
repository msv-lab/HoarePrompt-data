The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of.**
