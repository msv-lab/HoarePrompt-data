To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 2.
- If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
- If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, then these conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.
- If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the conditions for `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `check_all` remain unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]`:**
   - `i` is 2, so `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]` and `a[i]` is `a[2]`.
   - If `a[1]` is greater than `a[2]`, then `a[1]` is greater than `a[2]` (this is a tautology and always true if the condition is met).

2. **Condition for `a[n-2]` and `a[n-1]`:**
   - If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
   - `new` is `a[2:]`.

3. **Conditions for `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `check_all`:**
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order.
   - If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, then these conditions remain unchanged.
   - If `a[1]` is not greater than `a[2]`, the conditions for `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `check_all` remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
- The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
