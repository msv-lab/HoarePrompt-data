To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
   - `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[2]`) is greater than `a[i]` (which is `a[3]`).
   - `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

2. **Conditions Analysis:**
   - `a[2] > a[3]` indicates that the third element is greater than the fourth element.
   - `a[n-2] > a[n-1]` indicates that the second-to-last element is greater than the last element.
   - `check_all_new` checks if all elements in `new` (from index 3 to the end) are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
   - `new_all` checks if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
   - `check_all` checks if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `a[2] > a[3]` and `a[n-2] > a[n-1]`, it is clear that the elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are not in non-decreasing order. Therefore, `check_all` will be `False`.
   - Since `check_all` is `False`, the conditions for the `print('YES')` statement to execute are not dependent on any other conditions provided.

Thus, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the other conditions.

Output: **YES**
