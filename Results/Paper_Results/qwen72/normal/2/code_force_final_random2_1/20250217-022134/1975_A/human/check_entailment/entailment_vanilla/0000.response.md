Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Sorted Array**: The function checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case. This is a valid and efficient check.

3. **Finding the First Out-of-Order Element**: If the array is not already sorted, the function iterates through the array to find the first position where the order is violated (`a[i - 1] > a[i]`). This is a correct approach to identify the point where the array deviates from being sorted.

4. **Splitting and Checking the New Array**: Once the out-of-order element is found, the function splits the array into two parts: `new` (from the out-of-order element to the end) and the remaining part. It then checks two conditions:
   - All elements in `new` should be less than or equal to the first element of the original array (`a[0]`).
   - The elements in `new` should be in non-decreasing order.

5. **Output Based on Conditions**: If both conditions are met, the function prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

However, there is a logical issue in the implementation:
- The function breaks out of the loop immediately after checking the first out-of-order element. This means it only checks one possible split and does not consider other potential splits that might make the array sorted.

To fix this, the function should continue checking all possible splits until it finds a valid one or exhausts all possibilities.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n))
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            found = False
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:] + a[:i]
                    check_all_new = all(new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, n))
                    if check_all_new:
                        print('YES')
                        found = True
                        break
            if not found:
                print('NO')
```

In this corrected version:
- The function continues to check all possible splits by iterating through the array.
- It constructs the new array by concatenating the suffix and prefix.
- It checks if the new array is sorted.
- If a valid split is found, it prints 'YES' and sets `found` to `True`.
- If no valid split is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'.

Given the original function's logic, the correctness is **False** because it does not handle all possible splits correctly.

Correctness: **False**
