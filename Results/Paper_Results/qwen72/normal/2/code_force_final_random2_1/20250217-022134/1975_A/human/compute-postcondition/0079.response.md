Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
