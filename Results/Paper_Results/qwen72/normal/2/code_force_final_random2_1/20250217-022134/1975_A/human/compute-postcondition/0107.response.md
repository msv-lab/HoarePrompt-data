To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is now updated to reflect whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the execution of this specific `print` statement. They are used to set up the context but do not influence the output of the `print` statement itself.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables or the conditions provided in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
