Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The code snippet evaluates whether all elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order and assigns the result to the variable `check_all`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be at least 1
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is `n-1`
- If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index `n-1` to the end
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`
- Regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of

After executing the code:
- `check_all` is assigned the result of the expression `all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`, which checks if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n-1`, if `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index `n-1` to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`. If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, then these conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the conditions for `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `check_all` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`. If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, then these conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the conditions for `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `check_all` remain unchanged. In both the if and else parts, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, and `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`. `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, or if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the conditions for `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `check_all` remain unchanged, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
