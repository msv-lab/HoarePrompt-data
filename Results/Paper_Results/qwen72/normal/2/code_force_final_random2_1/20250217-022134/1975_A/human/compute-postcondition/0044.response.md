Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input. If `check_all` is `True`, then `a` is non-decreasing. If `check_all` is `False`, then `a` is not non-decreasing, `i` is `n-1`. If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index `n-1` to the end. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
