Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n-1`. If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index `n-1` to the end. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- This operation updates the value of `a` to a new list of integers from the input.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`, `check_all`) remain unchanged or their definitions are still valid based on the updated value of `a`.
