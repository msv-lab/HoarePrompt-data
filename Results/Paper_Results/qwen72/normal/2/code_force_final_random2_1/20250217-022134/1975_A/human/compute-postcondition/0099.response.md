Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Additionally, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
