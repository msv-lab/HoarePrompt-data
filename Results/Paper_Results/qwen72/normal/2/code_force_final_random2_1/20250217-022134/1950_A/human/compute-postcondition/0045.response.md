Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `i` is 4, `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'. Otherwise, `res` is 'none'.***
