Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If `x` < `y`, then: if `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'; if `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'; if `y` = `z`, `res` is 'none'. If `x` >= `y`, `res` is 'none'.**
