Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `i` is 4, `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `res` is 'none'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string 'none' to the variable `res`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
