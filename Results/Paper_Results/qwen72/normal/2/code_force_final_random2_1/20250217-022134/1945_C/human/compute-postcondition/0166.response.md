To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the objects in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(n - 1)`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be incremented from 0 to 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`mini` is \(10^8\), `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0. `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0. `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`, `pk` is set to `n // 2`, `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the integer `0` and its length is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, and its length is 0. The values of `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Additionally, if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains the element `i + 1`.**
