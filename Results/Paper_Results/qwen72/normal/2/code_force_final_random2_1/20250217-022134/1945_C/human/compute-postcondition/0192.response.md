Postcondition: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `lst` is a non-empty list, and `elem` is the first element in `lst`. `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `final` are empty lists. `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged. Additionally, the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**
