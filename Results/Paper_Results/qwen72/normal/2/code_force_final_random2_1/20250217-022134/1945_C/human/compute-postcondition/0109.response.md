Output State: **`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 3))`, `lst` includes the value `i + 1`, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`) retain their initial values.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `one_perc` which was previously updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 3))`.
