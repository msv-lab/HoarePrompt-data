Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `lst` must contain at least as many elements as the number of iterations executed, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `final` is now an empty list, and `c1` remain unchanged.**
