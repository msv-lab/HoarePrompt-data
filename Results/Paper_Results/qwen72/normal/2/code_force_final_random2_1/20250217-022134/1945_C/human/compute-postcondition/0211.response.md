Let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the `print(final[0])` statement:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mini` is the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
   - `lst` is a non-empty list.
   - `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, and `final` is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc` are empty lists.
   - `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged.
   - If the length of `final` is 0, the state of the program remains as described above.
   - If the length of `final` is 1, `c1` is updated to `o * 100 // n`.
   - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of `final` is 0.
   - Otherwise, `c1` is less than 50.

2. **Analysis**:
   - We need to determine the value of `final[0]` when the `print(final[0])` statement is executed.
   - The key condition here is the length of `final`. Since the problem states that if the length of `final` is 1, `c1` is updated to `o * 100 // n`.
   - After updating `c1`, if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of `final` is set to 0.
   - If `c1` is less than 50, the first element of `final` remains unchanged.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that `final` has a length of 1, the value of `c1` is determined by `o * 100 // n`.
   - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final[0]` is set to 0.
   - If `c1` is less than 50, `final[0]` remains the original value from the list `lst`.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `c1`:
- If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the output will be 0.
- If `c1` is less than 50, the output will be the first element of `final`.

Output: **0 (if c1 is greater than or equal to 50) or the first element of final (if c1 is less than 50)**
