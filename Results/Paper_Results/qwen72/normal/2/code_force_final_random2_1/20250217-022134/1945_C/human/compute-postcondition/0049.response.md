Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character, rounded up, `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the string, rounded up, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `lst`.
- For each iteration, the variable `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.
- After all iterations, `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
