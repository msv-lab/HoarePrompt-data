The given code snippet updates the value of `one_perc` based on the existing values of `o`, `one`, `n`, and `i`. Let's go through the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3
   - `s` is an input string
   - `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd
   - `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`
   - `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`
   - `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`
   - `mini` is 100000000
   - `i` is 2
   - If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 3 and `one` is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is 2 and `one` is 1
   - `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 3)`
   - `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`
   - If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `lst` is `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` is `[2]`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet updates `one_perc` using the formula: `one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `one_perc` is updated to the new value calculated by the formula.

4. **Calculation:**
   - `one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`
   - Here, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`
   - `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 1
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`
   - `i` is 2
   - `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 3`

5. **Output State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3
   - `s` is an input string
   - `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd
   - `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`
   - `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`
   - `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`
   - `mini` is 100000000
   - `i` is 2
   - If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 3 and `one` is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is 2 and `one` is 1
   - `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 3)`
   - `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 3))`
   - If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `lst` is `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` is `[2]`

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 3 and `one` is 0, otherwise `zero` is 2 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 3)`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 3))`, if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `lst` is `[1, 2]`, otherwise `lst` is `[2]`.**
