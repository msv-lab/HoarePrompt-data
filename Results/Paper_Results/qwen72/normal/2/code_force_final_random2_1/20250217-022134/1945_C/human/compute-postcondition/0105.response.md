Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is a new input integer greater than 2, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 2, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 2 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 2))`, and `lst` contains the elements [1, 2] if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` contains the element 1.**
