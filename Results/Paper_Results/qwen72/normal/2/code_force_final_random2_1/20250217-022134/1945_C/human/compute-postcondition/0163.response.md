Postcondition: **`mini` is \(10^8\), `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0. `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0. `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`, `pk` is set to `n // 2`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the integer `0` and its length is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, and its length is 0. The values of `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 0, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Additionally, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.**
