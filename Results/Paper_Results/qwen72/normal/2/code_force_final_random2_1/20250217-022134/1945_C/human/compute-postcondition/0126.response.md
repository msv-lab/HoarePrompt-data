The code snippet `final.append(elem)` adds the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial state, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, and `final` is initially an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` already contains `elem`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `elem` is the second element in `lst`.
- `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
- If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.

After executing `final.append(elem)`, `elem` is added to `final`. Therefore, `final` now contains `elem` regardless of whether it was already in `final` or not.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `c1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `c1` remain unchanged, `final` is a list containing `elem`.**
