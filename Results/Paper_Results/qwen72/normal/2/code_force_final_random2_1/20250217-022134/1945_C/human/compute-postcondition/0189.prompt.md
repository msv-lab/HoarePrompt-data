Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `zero` is the total count of '0' characters in the string `s` up to `n-1`, `one` is the total count of '1' characters in the string `s` up to `n-1`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of the percentage of '0' characters encountered so far relative to the current index, `one_perc` is the ceiling of the percentage of remaining '1' characters relative to the remaining characters in the string, and `lst` is a list containing the indices (1-based) where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50. The final state of `final` depends on the conditions described in the initial state, but it will be a sorted list based on the criteria given. The values of `mini`, `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, `o` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`; `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `final`, `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, `o` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`; `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `final`, `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, `o` remain unchanged; `ele` is the next element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`; `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `final`, `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, `o` remain unchanged; `ele` is the next element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
