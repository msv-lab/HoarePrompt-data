To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `lst`.

1. **`elem`**: This variable will take on the values of elements in `lst` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be initialized before the loop starts, as it is automatically set by the loop.

2. **`lst`**: For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. If `lst` is empty, the loop will not run.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string
- `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`
- `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`
- `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`
- `mini` is the minimum value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`
- `one` is the total number of '1's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`
- `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character, rounded up
- `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the string, rounded up
- `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50
- `final` is an empty list

For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character, rounded up, `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the string, rounded up, `lst` must contain at least one element, `final` is an empty list**
