Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is \(10^8\), `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`, `pk` is set to `n // 2`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the integer `0` and its length is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, and its length is 0. The values of `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mini` is \(10^8\), `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0. `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0. `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`, `pk` is set to `n // 2`, `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the integer `0` and its length is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, and its length is 0. The values of `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 0, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Additionally, if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains the element `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`, `pk` is set to `n // 2`, `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` (which is 2) if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the integer `0` and its length is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, and its length is 0, `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains the element 2, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`, `pk` is set to `n // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is [3], and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the integer `0` and its length is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, and its length is 0. If `zero_perc` or `one_perc` is less than 50, `lst` remains an empty list, and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
