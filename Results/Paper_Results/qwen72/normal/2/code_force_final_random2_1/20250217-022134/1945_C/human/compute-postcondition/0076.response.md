Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character, rounded up, `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the string, rounded up, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is the integer value of `(o * 100) // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0 and has a length of 1. Otherwise, `final` now includes `n` and has a length of 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pk` is updated to `n // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `final`, `c1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
