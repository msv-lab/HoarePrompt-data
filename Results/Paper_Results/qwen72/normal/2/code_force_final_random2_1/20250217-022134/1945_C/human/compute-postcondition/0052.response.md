Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character, rounded up, `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the string, rounded up, `lst` must contain at least one element, `final` is an empty list, and the current value of `elem` is such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**
