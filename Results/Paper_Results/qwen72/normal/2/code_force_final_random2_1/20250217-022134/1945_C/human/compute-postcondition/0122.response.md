Postcondition: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `final` is an empty list, and `c1` remain unchanged. Additionally, the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**
