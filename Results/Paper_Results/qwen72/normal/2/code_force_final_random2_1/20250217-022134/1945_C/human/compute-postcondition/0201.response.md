Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `mini` remains the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `lst` is a non-empty list, and `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The variables `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc` remain empty lists, and `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
- For each element, if the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`, the element is appended to the `final` list.
- After all iterations, `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`.
- The variables `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc` are not modified within the loop and remain empty lists.
- The variables `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` are not modified within the loop and remain unchanged.
