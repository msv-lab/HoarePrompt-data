To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `lst`.

### Analysis:
- **`elem`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `lst` during each iteration of the loop.
- **`lst`**: This is the list over which the loop iterates. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.

### Given State:
- `lst` must contain at least as many elements as the number of iterations executed.
- `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
- Other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `final`, `c1`) remain unchanged.

### Required Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes, `lst` must have at least one element.
- The variable `elem` will be set to the first element of `lst` at the start of the first iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `final` is an empty list, and `c1` remain unchanged.**
