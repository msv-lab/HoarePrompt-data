Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `lst` is a non-empty list, and `elem` is the first element in `lst`. `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `final` are lists where `final` now contains `elem`. `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged. Additionally, the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation:
- The code `final.append(elem)` adds the first element of `lst` (which is `elem`) to the list `final`.
- All other variables (`mini`, `lst`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini` still holds true.
