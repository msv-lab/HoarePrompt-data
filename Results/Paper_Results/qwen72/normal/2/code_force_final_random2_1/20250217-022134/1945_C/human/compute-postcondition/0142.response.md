Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `lst` contains at least as many elements as the number of iterations executed.
   - `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
   - `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`.
   - `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `c1` remain unchanged.
   - If `len(final) == 0`:
     - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the integer `0` and its length is 1.
     - If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, and its length is 0.
   - `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`.

2. **Determine the Value of `c1`**:
   - `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
   - This means `c1` is the percentage of `o` relative to `n`.

3. **Determine the Content of `final`**:
   - If `len(final) == 0`:
     - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` is set to `[0]`.
     - If `c1 < 50`, `final` remains an empty list.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(final[0])`.
   - This means we need to determine the first element of `final`.

5. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `len(final) > 0`, `final[0]` will be the first element of the sorted list `final`.
   - If `len(final) == 0` and `c1 >= 50`, `final` is `[0]`, so `final[0]` is `0`.
   - If `len(final) == 0` and `c1 < 50`, `final` is an empty list, and accessing `final[0]` would raise an `IndexError`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the problem states that if `len(final) == 0` and `c1 >= 50`, `final` is `[0]`, the only way `final[0]` can be accessed without raising an error is if `c1 >= 50`.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output `0` if `c1 >= 50`.

Output: **0 (if c1 >= 50, otherwise an IndexError will occur)**.
