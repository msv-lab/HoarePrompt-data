Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the letter that appears most frequently. The logic is straightforward and handles all edge cases, including when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal (since the problem specifies that the string length is always 5, this scenario is not possible). Therefore, the program is correct for all potential inputs.
