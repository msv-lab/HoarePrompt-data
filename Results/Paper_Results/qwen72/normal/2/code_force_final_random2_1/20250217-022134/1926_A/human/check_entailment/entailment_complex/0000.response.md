Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the character that appears more frequently. If the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This matches the problem description and the expected output format.

The program also handles the constraints correctly:
- It ensures that `1 <= t <= 32`.
- It processes each test case independently and correctly.
- It correctly handles the case where the number of 'A's is equal to the number of 'B's by printing 'B' (since `if l > h` will be false, and it will go to the `else` block).

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
