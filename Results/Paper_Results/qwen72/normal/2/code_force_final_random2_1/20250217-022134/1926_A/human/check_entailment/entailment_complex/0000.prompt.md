Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and each of the t test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is `t-1`, `a` is a new input string with 5 characters, `l` is the number of 'A's in `a`, and `h` is the number of 'B's in `a`. If the number of 'A's in `a` is greater than the number of 'B's in `a`, then `l` > `h`. Otherwise, the number of 'A's in `a` is less than or equal to the number of 'B's in `a`, so `l` ≤ `h`. Each of the `t` test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', all `t` strings are distinct.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 32`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. The function counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. If the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed a result ('A' or 'B') for each test case. The final state of the program is that `t` results have been printed, one for each test case.
