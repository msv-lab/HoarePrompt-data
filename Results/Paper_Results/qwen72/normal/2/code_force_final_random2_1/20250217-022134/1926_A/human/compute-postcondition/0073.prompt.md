Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 32, and each of the t test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a = input()
    l = 0
    h = 0
    for j in a:
        if j == 'A':
            l += 1
        else:
            h += 1
    if l > h:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 0, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string `a`, `h` is the number of 'B's in the input string `a`, and each of the `t` test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', all `t` strings are distinct. If `l` > `h`, the number of 'A's in the input string `a` is greater than the number of 'B's. Otherwise, the number of 'A's is less than or equal to the number of 'B's.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 1, `a` is a new input string with `n` characters, `l` is the number of 'A's in `a`, and `h` is the number of 'B's in `a`. If the number of 'A's in `a` is greater than the number of 'B's in `a`, then `l` > `h`. Otherwise, the number of 'A's in `a` is less than or equal to the number of 'B's in `a`, so `l` ≤ `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a new input string with `n` characters, `l` is the number of 'A's in `a`, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in `a`. If the number of 'A's in `a` is greater than the number of 'B's in `a`, then `l` > `h`. Otherwise, the number of 'A's in `a` is less than or equal to the number of 'B's in `a`, so `l` ≤ `h`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
