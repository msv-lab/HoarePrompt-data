Output State: **`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1', and `length` remains 30. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or if `flag` is 0, then `length` is 30, and `s` has 30 elements. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` remains 1. Any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been left unchanged. The value of `s[i - 1]` is now '-1', and the value of `s[i]` is '0'.**
