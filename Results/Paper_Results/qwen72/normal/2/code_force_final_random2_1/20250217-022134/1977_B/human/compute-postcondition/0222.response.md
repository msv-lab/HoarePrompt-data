Postcondition: **After the loop executes all 29 iterations, `i` is 28, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The final state of `s` depends on the transitions defined within the loop. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i + 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is set to '-1', and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is set to '0', and `flag` remains 1. Otherwise, `s[i]` remains unchanged. The value of `flag` is 1. The variables `length`, `x`, `t`, and `nalla` remain unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'.**
