Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (where 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30). It then processes `x` to generate a modified binary representation stored in a list `s`. This list is manipulated according to specific rules, potentially extending its length to 31 bits. Finally, the function prints the length of the modified list and the elements of the list. The function does not return any value. **
