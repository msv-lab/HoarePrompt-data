Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 (or 31 if `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0'), `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29 or 30). The second element of `s` (at index 1) is '0', and the first element of `s` (at index 0) is '1'.**
