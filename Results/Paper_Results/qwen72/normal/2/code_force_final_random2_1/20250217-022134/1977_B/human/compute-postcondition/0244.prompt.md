Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 (or 31 if `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0'), `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29 or 30). For all indices `j` from 1 to 29 (or 30), if `s[j]` is '-1' and `s[j-1]` is '1', then `s[j]` is now '0' and `s[j-1]` is now '-1'. This process continues until no more such pairs are found.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `i` is 30, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1', and `length` remains 30. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or if `flag` is 0, then `length` is 30, and `s` has 30 elements. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` remains 1. Any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been left unchanged. The loop has processed all elements from index 1 to `length - 1`, and any occurrences of `-1` followed by `1` have been replaced with `0` followed by `-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all 29 iterations, `i` is 28, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The final state of `s` will have all occurrences of '1' followed immediately by '-1' replaced with '-1' followed by '0'. Any other elements in `s` remain unchanged. `flag` is 0, and `x`, `t`, and `nalla` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
