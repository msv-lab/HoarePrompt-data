The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. This operation modifies the list `s` by adding `'1'` to its end. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing the string '1' (if it did not already contain '1', otherwise it now contains an additional '1').**
