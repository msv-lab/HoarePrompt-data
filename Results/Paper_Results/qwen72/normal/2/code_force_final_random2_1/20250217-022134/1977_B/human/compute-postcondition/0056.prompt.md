Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). If a bit in `x` is set (i.e., 1), the corresponding element in `s` is '1'. If a bit in `x` is not set (i.e., 0), the corresponding element in `s` is '0'. `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `flag` is set to 1, `s[0]` is set to '-1', and `s[1]` is set to '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, then `s[0]` is set to '0'. If `flag` is 0, then `s[0]` remains unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[1]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `s[1]` is '0', then `s[0]` is set to '0'. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains unchanged. If `flag` is 1, `s[1]` is set to '0'. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). If `flag` is 0, `s[2]` is the same as `s[3]`, and `s[2]` is '1', then `s[2]` is set to '-1', `s[1]` is set to '0', and `s[0]` is set to '0', and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` is '0', then `s[1]` is set to '0'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[1]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `s[1]` is '0', then `s[0]` is set to '0'. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
