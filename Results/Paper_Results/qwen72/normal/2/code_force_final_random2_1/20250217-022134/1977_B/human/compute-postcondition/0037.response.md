Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `flag` is set to 1, `s[0]` is set to '-1', and `s[1]` is set to '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, then `s[0]` is set to '0'. If `flag` is 0, then `s[0]` remains unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'. `s[1]` is now '1'.**
