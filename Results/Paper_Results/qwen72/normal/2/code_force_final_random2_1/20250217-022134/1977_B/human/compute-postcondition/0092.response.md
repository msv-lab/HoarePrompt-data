The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range defined by `range(30)`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates over a fixed range from 0 to 29, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 1, as the loop condition is based on `i` being less than 30.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, and `s` is a list. If the bitwise AND of `x` and `2^i` (which is 2) is non-zero, `s` contains the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` contains the string '0'.**
