Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29), `flag` is 0, `s[0]` is '-1', `s[1]` is '1'.** 

The value of `s[0]` has been updated to '-1', while the rest of the initial state remains unchanged. The value of `s[1]` is still '1'.
