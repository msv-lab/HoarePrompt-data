Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1' at index 0, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 2. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[0]` is set to '-1', and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains as '0' or '1' based on the binary representation of `x`, and `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0'.***
