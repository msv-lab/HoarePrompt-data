To determine what will be printed by the `print(*s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformation applied to the list `s`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 28.
- `length` is 30.
- `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'.
- The final state of `s` will have all occurrences of '1' followed immediately by '-1' replaced with '-1' followed by '0'.
- `flag` is 0.
- `x`, `t`, and `nalla` remain unchanged.

### Transformation:
- The transformation rule states that any occurrence of '1' followed immediately by '-1' in the list `s` will be replaced with '-1' followed by '0'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Pattern**: We need to identify all occurrences of the pattern '1' followed by '-1' in the list `s`.
2. **Apply the Transformation**: For each identified pattern, replace '1' with '-1' and '-1' with '0'.

### Example Transformation:
Let's assume an example list `s` to illustrate the transformation:
```python
s = ['1', '-1', '0', '1', '1', '-1', '0', '1', '0', '-1', '1', '0', '1', '-1', '0', '0', '1', '-1', '1', '0', '1', '-1', '0', '1', '0', '-1', '1', '0', '1', '-1']
```

Applying the transformation:
- '1', '-1' -> '-1', '0'
- '1', '-1' -> '-1', '0'
- '1', '-1' -> '-1', '0'
- '1', '-1' -> '-1', '0'

After applying the transformation, the list `s` becomes:
```python
s = ['-1', '0', '0', '1', '-1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '-1', '1', '0', '-1', '0', '0', '0', '-1', '0', '-1', '0', '-1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '-1', '1', '0', '-1', '0']
```

### General Case:
Since the exact initial list `s` is not provided, we can only describe the transformation in general terms. The final list `s` will have all occurrences of '1' followed by '-1' replaced with '-1' followed by '0', and all other elements will remain unchanged.

### Final Output:
The `print(*s)` statement will print the elements of the transformed list `s` separated by spaces.

Output: **-1 0 0 1 -1 0 0 1 0 -1 1 0 -1 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 -1 1 0 -1 0** (where the exact elements depend on the initial list `s` but follow the transformation rule described).
