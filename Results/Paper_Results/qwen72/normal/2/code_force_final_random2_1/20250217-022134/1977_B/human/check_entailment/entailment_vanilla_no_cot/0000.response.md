Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from being fully correct according to the problem's requirements:

1. **Handling of Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**: The logic for ensuring that there are no consecutive non-zero elements (`a_i` and `a_{i+1}`) is flawed. The code attempts to handle this by setting flags and adjusting values, but it doesn't always correctly propagate the changes through the array.

2. **Adjustment of Array Length**: The code sometimes incorrectly adjusts the length of the array, especially when handling the last bit. This can lead to incorrect results or unnecessary padding with zeros.

3. **Final Adjustment Loop**: The final loop that attempts to adjust the array to ensure no consecutive non-zero elements is not robust enough and can fail in certain edge cases.

Here is a corrected version of the function that should work correctly:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        while x > 0:
            if x % 2 == 1:
                if x % 4 == 1:
                    s.append(1)
                else:
                    s.append(-1)
                    x += 2
            else:
                s.append(0)
            x //= 2
        
        # Reverse the list to get the correct order
        s = s[::-1]
        
        # Ensure the length is at most 32
        while len(s) < 32:
            s.append(0)
        
        # Remove trailing zeros
        while s and s[-1] == 0:
            s.pop()
        
        print(len(s))
        print(*s)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The array `s` is constructed correctly to represent the binary form of `x` with the required constraints.
- No consecutive non-zero elements are present.
- The length of the array is within the specified bounds (1 to 32).

This should handle all test cases correctly.
