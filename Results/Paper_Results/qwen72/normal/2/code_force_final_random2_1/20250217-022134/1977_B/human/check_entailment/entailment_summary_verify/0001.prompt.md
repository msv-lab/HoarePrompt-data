You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 30
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        flag = 0
        for i in range(0, 29):
            if flag and s[i] == '0':
                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x < 2^30). It then processes `x` to generate a modified binary representation stored in a list `s`. This list is manipulated according to specific rules, potentially extending its length to 31 bits. Finally, the function prints the length of the modified list and the elements of the list. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Binary Representation**: For each test case, the function converts the integer `x` into its binary representation using a loop that checks each bit from 0 to 29. This is correct because the maximum value of `x` is less than \(2^{30}\), so 30 bits are sufficient.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints**:
   - The function uses a flag to handle the constraint that no two consecutive non-zero elements should exist.
   - It iterates through the binary representation and adjusts the values to ensure that if two consecutive '1's are found, the first one is changed to '-1' and a carry is set.
   - If a carry is set and the next bit is '0', it is changed to '1' and the carry is reset.
   - If the carry reaches the last bit, it is handled appropriately by either setting the last bit to '1' or appending an additional '1' to the list.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After the initial adjustments, the function makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by adjusting any remaining '-1' followed by '1' to '0' and '-1'.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the resulting array and the array itself, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
After reviewing the logic and steps, the program appears to correctly handle the constraints and produce the required output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
