The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant `30`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range function, which will generate numbers from 0 up to, but not including, 30. For the loop to execute, `i` should start from 0, as this is the initial value expected by the `range(30)`.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list**
