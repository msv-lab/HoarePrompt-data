Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 2, `flag` is 0. The current value of `s[0]` is '1' because `flag` is 0, and `s[i]` (which is `s[0]`) is '1'. Additionally, `s[i + 1]` (which is `s[1]`) is also '1'.**
