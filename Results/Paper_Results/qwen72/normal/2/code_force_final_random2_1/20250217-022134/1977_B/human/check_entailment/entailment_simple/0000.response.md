Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the value of `x` for each case. This matches the problem's input requirements.

2. **Binary Representation**: The program generates a binary representation of `x` using a list `s` where each element is either '1' or '0'. This is done using bitwise operations, which is a correct approach.

3. **Handling Adjacent Non-Zero Elements**: The program attempts to ensure that no two adjacent elements in `s` are non-zero by setting flags and adjusting the values accordingly. This is a crucial part of the problem, and the logic seems to handle it correctly by propagating `-1` values and adjusting subsequent bits.

4. **Final Adjustments**: After the main loop, the program checks if the `flag` is set and adjusts the last element of `s` accordingly. If necessary, it appends an additional '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1. This ensures that the final list meets the constraints of the problem.

5. **Output**: The program prints the length of the list `s` and the list itself, which is the required output format.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `x` is 1 or when `x` is close to the upper limit of \(2^{30}\). The logic for handling these cases appears to be sound.

Given the above points, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
