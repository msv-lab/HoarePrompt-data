Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 (or 31 if `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0'), `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29 or 30). If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[2]` is now '0' and `s[1]` is now '-1'. Additionally, if `s[1]` was '-1' and `s[0]` was '1', then `s[0]` is now '0'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged except for `s[2]` and `s[1]`.***
