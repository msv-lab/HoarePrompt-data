Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The `flag` is 1, and the last element of `s` (s[29]) is '0'. Any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been left unchanged.**
