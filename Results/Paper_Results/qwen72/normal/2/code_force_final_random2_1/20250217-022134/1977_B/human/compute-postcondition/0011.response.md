The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `range(30)`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates over a fixed range from 0 to 29 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(30):`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 30. After the first iteration, `i` will be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is set (i.e., 1), `s` is a list containing the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing the string '0'.**
