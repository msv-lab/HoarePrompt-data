The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`, and a string `a`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively.
- `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Given these parameters, the function processes each test case and returns some output based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers representing the number of problems in the bank (1 <= n <= 50) and the number of upcoming rounds (1 <= m <= 5), respectively. `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
