To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is `t`, where `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000).
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5).
- `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
- `p` is the string 'ABCDEF'.
- `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.
- `i` is the last key in `hmp` that was processed by the loop.
- `ans` is calculated as follows:
  - The sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`.
  - Plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.
- `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Count Occurrences in `s`:**
   - `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.

2. **Calculate `ans`:**
   - For each character in 'ABCDEF':
     - If the character is not in `hmp`, add `m` to `ans`.
     - If the character is in `hmp` and `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, add `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following inputs for clarity:
- `s = "ABCD"`
- `m = 3`

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Count Occurrences:**
   - `hmp` will be: `{'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1}`

2. **Calculate `ans`:**
   - For 'A': `hmp['A']` is 1, so add `(3 - 1) = 2` to `ans`.
   - For 'B': `hmp['B']` is 1, so add `(3 - 1) = 2` to `ans`.
   - For 'C': `hmp['C']` is 1, so add `(3 - 1) = 2` to `ans`.
   - For 'D': `hmp['D']` is 1, so add `(3 - 1) = 2` to `ans`.
   - For 'E': `hmp['E']` is 0 (not in `hmp`), so add `3` to `ans`.
   - For 'F': `hmp['F']` is 0 (not in `hmp`), so add `3` to `ans`.

   - Total `ans` = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans` based on the given conditions and the input string `s`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in hmp, plus the sum of (m - hmp[i]) for each character i in hmp where hmp[i] is less than m)**

In the example provided, the output would be:
Output: **14** (if `s = "ABCD"` and `m = 3`)
