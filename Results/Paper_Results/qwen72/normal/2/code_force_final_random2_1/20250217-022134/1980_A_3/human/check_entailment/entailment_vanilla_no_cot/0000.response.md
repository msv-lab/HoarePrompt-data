Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is almost correct but it misses an important detail. The string `p` only includes difficulties from 'A' to 'F', but the problem statement specifies that each round must include problems of difficulty levels 'A' through 'G'. Therefore, the string `p` should be `'ABCDEFG'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Corrected to include 'G'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            elif hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle all the required difficulty levels and produce the correct output.
