The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the dictionary `hmp`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `hmp`. If `hmp` has at least one key remaining, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next key in `hmp` after 'F', and `hmp` has at least one key remaining. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be set to the next key in `hmp` after the current `i`, and `hmp` must still have at least one key remaining.

State: **`p` is 'ABCDEF', `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current `i`, `hmp` has at least one key remaining. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
