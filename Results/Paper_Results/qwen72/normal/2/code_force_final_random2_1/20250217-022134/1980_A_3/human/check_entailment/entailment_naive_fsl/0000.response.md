Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the difficulty level 'G' is required. The string `p` used in the program only includes difficulties from 'A' to 'F', but the problem description specifies that each round should contain one problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. Therefore, the program will fail to account for the 'G' difficulty level, leading to incorrect results in cases where 'G' is needed. For example, if the input is:

```
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```

The program will output `2`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the 'G' difficulty level. The correct output should be `3` (one for 'A', one for 'F', and one for 'G').
