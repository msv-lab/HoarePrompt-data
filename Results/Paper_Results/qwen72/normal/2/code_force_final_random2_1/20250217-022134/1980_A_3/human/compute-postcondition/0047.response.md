Output State: **`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'F', `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`, and `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `p` which is 'ABCDEF'.
- For each character `i` in `p`, if `i` is not in the `hmp` (Counter object), `m` is added to `ans`.
- After all iterations, `ans` will be the total sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`.
- The value of `i` after the last iteration will be 'F'.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `p`, `hmp`, and `s`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
