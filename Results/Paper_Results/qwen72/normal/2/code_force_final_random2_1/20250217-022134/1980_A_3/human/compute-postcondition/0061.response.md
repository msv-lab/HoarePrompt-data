The provided code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This impacts the initial state by updating the values of `n` and `m` based on the user's input. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is an integer input by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is an integer input by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is the last key in `hmp` that was processed by the loop, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.**
