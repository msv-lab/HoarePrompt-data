Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from user input. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates the number of additional problems needed to ensure that each of the characters 'A' to 'F' appears at least `m` times in the string `s`. This count is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
