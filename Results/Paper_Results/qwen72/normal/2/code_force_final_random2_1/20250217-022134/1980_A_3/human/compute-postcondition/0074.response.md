The provided code snippet `ans += m` implies that the variable `ans` is being updated by adding the value of `m` to it. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `ans` or `m`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans` without these details.

However, the impact of the code is that `ans` is now `ans + m`, assuming `ans` had a value before this operation. Since the initial values of `ans` and `m` are not specified, we can only state that `ans` has been updated by adding `m` to its previous value.

The values of `p` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is 'ABCDEF', `i` is 'C', `ans` is updated to `ans + m`**.
