Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEF'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are now the integers provided by the user input, `s` is a non-empty string input by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` has iterated through all keys in `hmp`. `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all characters `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is the last key in `hmp` that was processed by the loop, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p` is 'ABCDEF', `i` is the last key in `hmp`, and `hmp` has no keys remaining to be processed. For each key `i` in `hmp`, if `hmp[i]` was less than `m`, `ans` was increased by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remained unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
