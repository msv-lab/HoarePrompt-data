Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum profit Bob can make by selling buns under the given conditions. The approach used in the program is a binary search over the possible values of \( k \) (the number of buns sold at the modified price). This is an efficient way to find the optimal \( k \) because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a peak and then decreases).

### Explanation of the Functions:
- **func_1(k, n, a, b)**: This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \). It uses the formula \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \), which correctly computes the total profit from selling \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.
- **func_2(n, a, b)**: This function performs a binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit. It initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and \( \min(n, b) \) respectively, and iterates to find the maximum profit. The binary search ensures that the function efficiently finds the optimal \( k \) by comparing the profit at the current midpoint with the profit at the next midpoint.

### Verification of the Algorithm:
- The binary search is correctly implemented, ensuring that the search space is halved in each iteration.
- The profit calculation in `func_1` is correct and matches the problem's requirements.
- The final profit returned by `func_2` is the maximum profit observed during the binary search, which is the correct solution for the problem.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases such as when \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) are at their minimum or maximum values.
- The binary search ensures that the program works efficiently even for large values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
