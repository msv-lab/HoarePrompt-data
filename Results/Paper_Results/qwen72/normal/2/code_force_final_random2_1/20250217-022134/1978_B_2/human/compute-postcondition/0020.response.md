The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust these two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `low` and `high`. The loop will execute again if `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

At the end of the last iteration, `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1`, and `high` is either the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Given the conditions, no specific adjustment is needed to the values of `low` and `high` as they are already set up to satisfy the condition `low <= high` based on the logic provided. Therefore, the state remains the same.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9. `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`, and `high` is either the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` is the maximum of 0, `profit_mid`, and the previous value of `max_profit`. `low` must be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute one more time.**
