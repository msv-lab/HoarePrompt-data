Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0; `mid` is (0 + min(`n`, `b`)) // 2; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**.

Explanation:
- The code calculates `profit_next` by calling `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `max_profit`, and `mid` remain unchanged.
- `profit_mid` retains its original value, which is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
- `profit_next` is now the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
