Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all his buns under the given promotion rules. The solution involves two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k` (number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, which correctly computes the total profit by summing the profits from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.
   - The function is mathematically sound and correctly implements the profit calculation based on the problem statement.

2. **`func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The binary search is performed over the range `[0, min(n, b)]`, which is the valid range for `k`.
   - For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, the function calculates the profit for `k = mid` and `k = mid + 1`.
   - It updates the `max_profit` with the higher of the two calculated profits and adjusts the search range accordingly.
   - The function correctly identifies the maximum profit by comparing the profits at each step and narrowing down the search range until the optimal `k` is found.

The overall structure and logic of the program align with the problem requirements. The binary search ensures that the function efficiently finds the maximum profit without needing to check every possible value of `k` explicitly.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
