Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`; `high` is either the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of 0, `profit_mid`, and the previous value of `max_profit`. `low` must be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute one more time.** 

Explanation: The code updates the value of `max_profit` to be the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_next`, `profit_mid`) remain unchanged. The condition for the loop to continue executing (`low` <= `high`) remains the same.
