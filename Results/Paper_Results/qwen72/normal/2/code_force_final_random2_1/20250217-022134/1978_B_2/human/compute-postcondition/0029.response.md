Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is the final value of `mid` where `profit_next` <= `profit_mid` or `low` is one more than `high`; `high` is the final value of `mid` - 1 where `profit_next` > `profit_mid` or `high` is one less than `low`; `max_profit` is the maximum profit calculated during the loop iterations.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`, `a`, and `b`**: These values remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`low`**: After the loop finishes, `low` will be the last value of `mid` where `profit_next` was not greater than `profit_mid`, or it will be one more than `high` if the loop exits because `low` became greater than `high`.
- **`high`**: Similarly, `high` will be the last value of `mid` - 1 where `profit_next` was greater than `profit_mid`, or it will be one less than `low` if the loop exits because `low` became greater than `high`.
- **`max_profit`**: This variable will hold the maximum profit calculated during the loop iterations, which is the highest value of `profit_mid` encountered.

The loop continues to narrow down the range `[low, high]` by comparing the profits at `mid` and `mid + 1`. The loop exits when `low` becomes greater than `high`, and at that point, `max_profit` contains the maximum profit found.
