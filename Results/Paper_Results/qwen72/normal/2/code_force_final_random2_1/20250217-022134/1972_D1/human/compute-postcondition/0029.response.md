Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is now `a - 1`, `x` is \((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1\) which simplifies to `a`. Additionally, the current value of `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0.**
