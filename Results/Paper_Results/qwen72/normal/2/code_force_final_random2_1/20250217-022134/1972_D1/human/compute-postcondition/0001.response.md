To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- The state before the loop starts: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is an input integer.
- The loop statement: `for t in range(T):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `t` and the variable `T`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop `for t in range(T)` will execute if `T` is greater than 0. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `T` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `t` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `T` must be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 0.
- The variable `t` will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0**
