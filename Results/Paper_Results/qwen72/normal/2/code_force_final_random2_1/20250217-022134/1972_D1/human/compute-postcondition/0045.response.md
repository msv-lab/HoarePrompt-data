Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `suma` to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the given range, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, and `i` is `b`.
- After executing the code, `suma` is now 0.
