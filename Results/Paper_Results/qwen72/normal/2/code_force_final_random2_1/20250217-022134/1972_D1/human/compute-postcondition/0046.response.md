To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` is at least 1, and `i` starts from 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `T` is greater than 1
- `t` is 2
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1
- `i` is `b`
- `suma` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `i` should start from 1, and `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is 0**
