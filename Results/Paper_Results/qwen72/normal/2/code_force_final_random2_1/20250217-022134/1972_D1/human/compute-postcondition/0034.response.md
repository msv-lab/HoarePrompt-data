Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is `a - 1 + (a - 2) // 4 + 1` if `a - 1 > 0`, otherwise `suma` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`. Otherwise, `suma` remains as `a - 1` if `a - 1 > 0`, otherwise `suma` is 0.**
