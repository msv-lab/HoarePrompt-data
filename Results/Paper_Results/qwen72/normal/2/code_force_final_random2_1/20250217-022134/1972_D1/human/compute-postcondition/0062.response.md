The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints given, it should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. However, since the output section is empty, it's unclear what the function returns based on these inputs. Without additional information about the expected output, I cannot fully describe the functionality of the function.

If we assume the function is supposed to return something based on the parameters `n` and `m`, the description would need to include what that output is. For example, if the function is supposed to return the sum of `n` and `m`, the functionality would be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and returns the sum of `n` and `m`.**

However, without knowing the actual output, the most accurate description I can provide is:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and returns an unspecified value based on these inputs.**
