The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This impacts the variable `info`, which now holds the list of strings.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
