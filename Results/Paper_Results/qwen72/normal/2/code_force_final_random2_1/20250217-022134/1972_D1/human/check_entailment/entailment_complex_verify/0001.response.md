Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The commented-out code block is not executed and does not contribute to the solution.
   - The main logic is in the loop where it calculates the number of valid pairs.
   - The variable `suma` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

4. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
   - However, this formula is derived from a specific condition and might not always be accurate. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly addressed by this formula.
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is an approximation and might not cover all valid pairs.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\) correctly.
   - However, the final result is `suma - 1`, which might be incorrect if there are no valid pairs for some \(i\).

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The output for the given test cases should match the expected results. However, the formula used might not always produce the correct count.
   - The provided test cases and their expected outputs suggest that the current implementation might not be fully correct.

Given the complexity of the problem and the specific formula used, the program seems to have logical issues and might not always produce the correct results. The formula used is an approximation and does not directly address the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Final: **False**
