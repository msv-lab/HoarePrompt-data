The code snippet `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding the current value of `x` to it. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `n` and `m` remain positive integers within the range \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `T` remains greater than 0.
- `t` remains 1.
- `info` remains a list of strings obtained from the new input.
- `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` remains the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3.
- `i` remains 3.
- `x` is calculated as \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to its current value.

Given the initial state, the value of `x` is \((a - 3 \times 2) // 9 + 1 = (a - 6) // 9 + 1\). The value of `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is \((a - 6) // 9 + 1\), `suma` is `suma + ((a - 6) // 9 + 1)`**.
