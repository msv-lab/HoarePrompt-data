The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t` and the condition that `t` must be less than `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1 and `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` will increment by 1, making it 2, and `T` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) **
