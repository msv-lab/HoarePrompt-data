Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is 0.** 

The variable `suma` is initialized to 0, while the other variables retain their initial values. The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the condition `(i + j) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0` are still to be printed, but this part of the code has not yet been executed.
