Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3. If `a - 6 > 0`, then `x` is \((a - 6) // 9 + 1\) and `suma` is updated to `suma + ((a - 6) // 9 + 1)`. Otherwise, `x` and `suma` remain unchanged.**
