Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` is `T-1`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the last input, `a` is the integer value of the last `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of the last `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) for each iteration, with the final `suma` being the total sum minus the number of iterations.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`T`**: This is the total number of iterations the loop will run. After all iterations, `T` remains the same.
- **`t`**: This variable increments by 1 with each iteration. After all iterations, `t` will be `T-1`.
- **`info`**: This is updated with each iteration to reflect the new input provided. After the last iteration, `info` will contain the last input split into a list of strings.
- **`a` and `b`**: These are derived from the last input and must be positive integers.
- **`i`**: This is set to `b` at the start of each iteration's inner loop.
- **`suma`**: This is calculated in each iteration as the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b`. The final value of `suma` is the total sum of these calculations minus the number of iterations (`T`).
