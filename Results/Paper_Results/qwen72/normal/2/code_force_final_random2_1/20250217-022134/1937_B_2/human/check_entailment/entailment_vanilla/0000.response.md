### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them using `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This ensures that it processes each test case individually.

2. **Grid Reading**: For each test case, the program reads the grid dimensions `n` and the two rows of the grid using `input()`. These values are stored in the list `a`.

3. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It also initializes a variable `x` to keep track of the position where the path changes from the top row to the bottom row.
   - The program iterates through the columns of the grid (from 0 to `n-2`) to find the first position where the next cell in the top row is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row is '0'. This is the optimal point to switch from the top row to the bottom row to minimize the lexicographical order.
   - If such a position is found, the program constructs the string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the top row up to that position with the suffix of the bottom row starting from that position.
   - If no such position is found, the program constructs the string `s` by simply concatenating the entire top row with the last cell of the bottom row.

4. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will store the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates through the positions up to `x` to count the number of valid paths. The logic here is to check if the prefix of the top row matches the prefix of the constructed string `s`. If they match, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It also prints the number of paths `t` that yield this string.

### Issues:
- **Path Counting Logic**: The logic for counting the number of paths is incorrect. The variable `t` should be updated based on the number of positions where the path can switch from the top row to the bottom row without changing the lexicographical order. The current logic does not correctly handle this.

### Corrected Path Counting:
- The correct way to count the number of paths is to count the number of positions where the path can switch from the top row to the bottom row without changing the lexicographical order. This can be done by counting the number of positions where the top row and the bottom row have the same value up to the point where the path switches.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct, but the logic for counting the number of paths is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
