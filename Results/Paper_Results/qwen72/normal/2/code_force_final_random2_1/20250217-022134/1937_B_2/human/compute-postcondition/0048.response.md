Output State: **`a` remains a list containing two elements, `n` is the same as initially provided, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the elements from index `x` onwards of `a[1]` if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met at some point, or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last element of `a[1]` if the condition was never met. `x` is the index where the condition was met, or `n - 1` if the condition was never met. `y` is the highest index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if the condition was never met. `i` is `y + 2`, `t` is `x - (y + 2) + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
