Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `a` remains a list containing two elements, `n` is the same as initially provided, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the elements from index `x` onwards of `a[1]` if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met at some point, or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last element of `a[1]` if the condition was never met. `x` is the index where the condition was met, or `n - 1` if the condition was never met. `y` is the highest index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if the condition was never met. `i` is `n - 2`. `t` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(y, x):
    if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` remains a list containing two elements, `n` is the same as initially provided, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the elements from index `x` onwards of `a[1]` if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met at some point, or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last element of `a[1]` if the condition was never met. `x` is the index where the condition was met, or `n - 1` if the condition was never met. `y` is the highest index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if the condition was never met. `i` is `y`, `t` is 1, and `y` must be less than `x`. If the subsequence of `a[1]` from index `i` to `x-1` is equal to the subsequence of `s` from index `i+1` to `x`, then `t` is updated to `x - i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` remains a list containing two elements, `n` is the same as initially provided, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the elements from index `x` onwards of `a[1]` if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met at some point, or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last element of `a[1]` if the condition was never met. `x` is the index where the condition was met, or `n - 1` if the condition was never met. `y` is the highest index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if the condition was never met. `i` is `y + 1`, `t` is 1, and `y` must be less than `x`. If `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is updated to `x - y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` remains a list containing two elements, `n` is the same as initially provided, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the elements from index `x` onwards of `a[1]` if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met at some point, or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last element of `a[1]` if the condition was never met. `x` is the index where the condition was met, or `n - 1` if the condition was never met. `y` is the highest index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if the condition was never met. `i` is `y + 2`, `t` is `x - (y + 2) + 1` if the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` is true, otherwise `t` remains 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` is true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
