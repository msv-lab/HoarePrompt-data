Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list or "abc10jkl", `x` is 0 or 2, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If the third character of the first string in `a` is '1' and the third character of the second string in `a` is '0', then `s` is "abc10jkl", `x` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty list and `x` remains 0.***
