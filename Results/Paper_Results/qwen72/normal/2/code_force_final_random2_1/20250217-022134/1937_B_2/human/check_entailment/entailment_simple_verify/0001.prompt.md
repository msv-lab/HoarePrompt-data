You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them using `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This ensures that it processes each test case individually.

2. **Grid Reading**: For each test case, the program reads the grid dimensions `n` and the two rows of the grid using `input()`. These values are stored in the list `a`.

3. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It also initializes a variable `x` to keep track of the position where the path changes from the top row to the bottom row.
   - The program iterates through the columns of the grid (from 0 to `n-2`) to find the first position where the next cell in the top row is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row is '0'. This is the optimal point to switch from the top row to the bottom row to minimize the lexicographical order.
   - If such a position is found, the program constructs the string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the top row up to that position with the suffix of the bottom row starting from that position.
   - If no such position is found, the program constructs the string `s` by simply concatenating the entire top row with the last cell of the bottom row.

4. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will store the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates through the positions up to `x` to count the number of valid paths. The logic here is to check if the prefix of the top row matches the prefix of the constructed string `s`. If they match, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It also prints the number of paths `t` that yield this string.

### Issues:
- **Path Counting Logic**: The logic for counting the number of paths is incorrect. The variable `t` should be updated based on the number of positions where the path can switch from the top row to the bottom row without changing the lexicographical order. The current logic does not correctly handle this.

### Corrected Path Counting:
- The correct way to count the number of paths is to count the number of positions where the path can switch from the top row to the bottom row without changing the lexicographical order. This can be done by counting the number of positions where the top row and the bottom row have the same value up to the point where the path switches.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct, but the logic for counting the number of paths is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
