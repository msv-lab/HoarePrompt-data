Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed exactly 2 times, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list or "abc10jkl", `x` is 0 or 2, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If the third character of the first string in `a` is '1' and the third character of the second string in `a` is '0', then `s` is "abc10jkl", `x` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty list and `x` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either an empty list or "abc10jkl", `x` is 0 or 2, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is the concatenation of the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the characters from index `i` onwards of `a[1]`, `x` is 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `s`, `x`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', `s` is the concatenation of the first 5 characters from `a[0]` and the substring from index 4 onwards from `a[1]`, `x` is 4, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `x` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
