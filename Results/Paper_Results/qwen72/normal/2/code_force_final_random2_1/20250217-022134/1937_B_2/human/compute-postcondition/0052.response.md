To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list containing two elements.
- `n` is the length of the elements in `a`.
- `s` is constructed based on certain conditions:
  - If the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met at some index `x`, then `s` is the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the elements from index `x` onwards of `a[1]`.
  - If the condition is never met, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last element of `a[1]`.
- `x` is the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met, or `n - 1` if the condition was never met.
- `y` is the highest index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if the condition was never met.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `t` is the value of `x - i + 1` if the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` was true for any `i` in the range `[y, x)`, otherwise `t` remains 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `x` and `s`:**
   - `x` is the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, or `n - 1` if never met.
   - `s` is constructed based on the value of `x`.

2. **Determine `y`:**
   - `y` is the highest index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` is true, or 0 if never met.

3. **Determine `i`:**
   - `i` is always `n - 2`.

4. **Determine `t`:**
   - `t` is the value of `x - i + 1` if the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` is true for any `i` in the range `[y, x)`.
   - Otherwise, `t` remains 1.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `a = ['1010', '0101']` and `n = 4`:
- **Determine `x`:**
  - Check the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`:
    - For `i = 0`: `a[0][1] == '0'` and `a[1][0] == '0'` (False)
    - For `i = 1`: `a[0][2] == '1'` and `a[1][1] == '0'` (True)
  - Therefore, `x = 1`.

- **Construct `s`:**
  - Since `x = 1`, `s` is the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the elements from index `x` onwards of `a[1]`:
  - `s = '10' + '01' = '1001'`.

- **Determine `y`:**
  - Check the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'`:
    - For `i = 0`: `a[0][1] == '0'` and `a[1][0] == '0'` (False)
    - For `i = 1`: `a[0][2] == '1'` and `a[1][1] == '0'` (False)
    - For `i = 2`: `a[0][3] == '0'` and `a[1][2] == '1'` (True)
  - Therefore, `y = 2`.

- **Determine `i`:**
  - `i = n - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2`.

- **Determine `t`:**
  - Check the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` for `i` in the range `[y, x) = [2, 1)`, which is an empty range.
  - Since the range is empty, the condition is never true.
  - Therefore, `t` remains 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
