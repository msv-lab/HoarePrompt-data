Reasoning:  
The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string using two counters, `l` for 'A' and `h` for 'B'. After counting, it compares the two counters and prints 'A' if `l` (the count of 'A') is greater than `h` (the count of 'B'), otherwise it prints 'B'. This logic correctly determines which character appears more frequently in each string.

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all specified constraints and requirements. The input and output formats match the problem statement, and the logic used to determine the most frequent character is correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
