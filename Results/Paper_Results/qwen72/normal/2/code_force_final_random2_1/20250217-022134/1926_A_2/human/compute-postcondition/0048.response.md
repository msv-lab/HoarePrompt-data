Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 1, `a` is a new input string with `n` characters, `l` is the number of 'A's in `a`, and `h` is the number of 'B's in `a`. If the number of 'A's in `a` is greater than the number of 'B's in `a`, then `l` > `h`. Otherwise, the number of 'A's in `a` is less than or equal to the number of 'B's in `a`, so `l` â‰¤ `h`.***
