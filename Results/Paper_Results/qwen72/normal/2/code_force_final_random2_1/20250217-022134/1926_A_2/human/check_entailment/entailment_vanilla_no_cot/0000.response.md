Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the letter that appears more frequently. The logic and flow of the program align with the requirements of the problem statement.
