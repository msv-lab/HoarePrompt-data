Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 0, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string `a`, `h` is the number of 'B's in the input string `a`, and each of the `t` test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', all `t` strings are distinct. If `l` > `h`, the number of 'A's in the input string `a` is greater than the number of 'B's. Otherwise, the number of 'A's is less than or equal to the number of 'B's.***
