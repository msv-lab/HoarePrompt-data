The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `a`. If `a` has more characters, the loop will continue to the next character.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, and `j` is the first character in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 characters, and `j` will be the second character in `a`.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 1, `a` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, and `j` is the second character in `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.**
