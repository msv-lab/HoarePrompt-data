The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` is 1 if `j` is not 'A' and 0 otherwise. After the increment, `h` will be 2 if `j` is not 'A' and 1 if `j` is 'A'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 0, `l` is 1 if `j` is 'A' and 0 otherwise, `h` is 2 if `j` is not 'A' and 1 if `j` is 'A', and each of the `t` test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', all `t` strings are distinct, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, and `j` is the second character of `a`.**
