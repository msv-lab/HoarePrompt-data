Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, `n` must be at least 9, and `m` must be at least 4, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1.**
