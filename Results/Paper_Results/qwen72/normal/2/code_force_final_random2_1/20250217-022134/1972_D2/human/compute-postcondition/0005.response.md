The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and it is decremented by 1 from the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after being decremented.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` is decremented by 1, but it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous iteration), `func_1()` has been called twice**
