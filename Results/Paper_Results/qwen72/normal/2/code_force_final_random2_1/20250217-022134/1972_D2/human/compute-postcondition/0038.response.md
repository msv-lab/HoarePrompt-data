To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

- The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
  - `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input.
  - `x` is 4.
  - `y` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1 such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`.
  - `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `x * x <= n` must still hold true. Given that `x` is 4, the condition becomes `4 * 4 <= n`, which simplifies to `16 <= n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer provided by the input and is part of the loop condition, it must remain such that `16 <= n` for the loop to execute again. The other variables (`m`, `y`, and `cnt`) do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state remains the same, as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 16.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 4, `y` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1 such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 16**.
