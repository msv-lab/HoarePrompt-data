The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It then calculates the number of pairs (x, y) such that 1 <= x, y, (x + y) * x <= n, and (x + y) * y <= m, with the additional condition that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y is 1. After performing this calculation, the function prints the count of such valid pairs. The final state of the program includes the printed count, and the original values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
