Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 28, `m` is greater than or equal to 21, `x` is 4, `y` is 5, and `cnt` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- After the third iteration, `y` is incremented to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must still hold true.
- Substituting `x = 4` and `y = 4`, we get:
  - `(4 + 4) * 4 = 32` which must be less than or equal to `n`.
  - `(4 + 4) * 4 = 32` which must be less than or equal to `m`.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 32 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 32.
- However, since the problem specifies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 28 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 21 after the third iteration, and these values are sufficient for the loop to execute one more time, the loop will indeed execute one more time.
- After the fourth iteration, `y` is incremented to 5, and the loop conditions are checked again. If the conditions are not met, the loop will terminate.
- Since `cnt` is only updated when `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, and `gcd(4, 4) = 4` (not 1), `cnt` remains unchanged after the third iteration.
- Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is `n` is greater than or equal to 28, `m` is greater than or equal to 21, `x` is 4, `y` is 5, and `cnt` remains unchanged.
