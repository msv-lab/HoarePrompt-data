The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and its initial state does not need to be specified since it is not used outside the loop context.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
