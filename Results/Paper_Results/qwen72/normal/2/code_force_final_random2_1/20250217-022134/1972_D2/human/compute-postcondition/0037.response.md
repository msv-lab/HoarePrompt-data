The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `y`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 4, `y` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1 such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.**
