Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0 or greater (since it was decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reached 0), and the function `func_1()` will have been called exactly `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer.
