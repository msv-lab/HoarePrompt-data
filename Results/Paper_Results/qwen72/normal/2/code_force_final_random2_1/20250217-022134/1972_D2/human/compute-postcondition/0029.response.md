Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input.
- `x` is 3.
- `y` is 2.
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.
- If the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 12, m // 4)`.
- `n` must be at least 15, and `m` must be at least 10.

Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `x` is 3.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `cnt` is already calculated based on the initial conditions.

2. **Expression Calculation**:
   - Calculate `x + y`: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).
   - Calculate `(x + y) * x`: \( 5 * 3 = 15 \).
   - Calculate `(x + y) * y`: \( 5 * 2 = 10 \).

3. **Minimum Calculation**:
   - Calculate `n // 15` and `m // 10`.
   - Determine the minimum of these two values: `min(n // 15, m // 10)`.

4. **Update `cnt`**:
   - Add the result of the minimum calculation to `cnt`.

Given the initial state, let's assume `n` and `m` are such that they satisfy the conditions (at least 15 and 10 respectively). Let's denote the initial value of `cnt` as `cnt_initial`.

The new value of `cnt` will be:
\[ cnt_{\text{new}} = cnt_{\text{initial}} + \min(n // 15, m // 10) \]

Output State:
**`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + min(n // 15, m // 10)`, `n` must be at least 15, and `m` must be at least 10.**
