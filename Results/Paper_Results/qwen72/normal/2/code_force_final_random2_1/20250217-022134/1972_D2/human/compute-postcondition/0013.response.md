The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` was 2, so the new value of `y` is 3. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input and must be at least 2, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 1 + the minimum of (`n` // 3) and (`m` // 6) if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 1.**
