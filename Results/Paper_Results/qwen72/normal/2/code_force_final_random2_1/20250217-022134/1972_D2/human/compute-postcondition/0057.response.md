The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided signature. However, given the context that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, it is likely that these values are used internally within the function. Since the output is not specified, I cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on the typical behavior of functions dealing with such parameters, the function might perform some operation involving `n` and `m` and return a result.

Functionality: **The function uses internal positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and performs an unspecified operation, returning a result based on these values.**
