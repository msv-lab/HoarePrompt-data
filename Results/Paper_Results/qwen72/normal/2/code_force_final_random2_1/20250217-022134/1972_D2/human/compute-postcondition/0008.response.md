The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraint, it is implied that there might be an internal use of a variable `t` which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since no specific output is provided, we cannot determine the exact return value from the information given. However, typically such a function would perform some operation using `t` and return a result based on that operation.

Given the lack of specific output details, I can only infer the general structure based on the provided constraints. If we assume the function returns a value based on `t`, the functionality could be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function performs an operation internally using a positive integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 10^4) and returns a result based on that operation.**
