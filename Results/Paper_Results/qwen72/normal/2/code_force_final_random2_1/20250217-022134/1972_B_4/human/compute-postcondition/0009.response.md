Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the value of `data[2]`.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `s`. Since `index` is 2, `s` now holds the value of `data[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
