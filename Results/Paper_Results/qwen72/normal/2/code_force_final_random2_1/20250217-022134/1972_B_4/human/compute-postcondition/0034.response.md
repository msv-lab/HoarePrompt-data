The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. The value of `results` depends on whether `num_up_coins` is odd or even, but in both cases, `'NO'` is appended to the existing list.

- If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` was initially `['YES', 'NO']`. After appending `'NO'`, `results` becomes `['YES', 'NO', 'NO']`.
- If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` was initially `['NO', 'NO']`. After appending `'NO'`, `results` becomes `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`.

Other variables (`t`, `index`, `n`, `s`, `num_up_coins`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is 7, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `s` is the value of `data[6]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing three elements ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` is a list containing three elements ['NO', 'NO', 'NO'].**
