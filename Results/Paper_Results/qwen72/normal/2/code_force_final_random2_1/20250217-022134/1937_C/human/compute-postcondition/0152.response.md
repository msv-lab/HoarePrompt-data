Output State: **After the loop completes all iterations, `I` and `R` remain defined, `kp` is equal to the initial value of `int(input())` minus 1, `n` is the last input integer greater than 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the comparison `r` was '<' in the first inner loop, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the comparison `r` was '>' in the second inner loop, or 0 if no such `i` exists, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The function `I` and the lambda function `R` remain defined as they were initially.
- The variable `kp` will be equal to the initial value of `int(input())` minus 1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `n` will hold the last input integer provided during the last iteration of the loop, which must be greater than 0.
- The variable `g` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `v1` will hold the last value of `i` for which the comparison `r` was '<' in the first inner loop. If no such `i` exists, `v1` will be 0.
- The variable `prev` will hold the last value of `i` for which the comparison `r` was '>' in the second inner loop. If no such `i` exists, `prev` will be 0.
- The output buffer has been flushed after each print statement, ensuring that all outputs have been sent to the console.
