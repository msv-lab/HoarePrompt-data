The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1, and `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set). Otherwise, `prev` remains 0, and `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).**
