Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input, the output buffer has been flushed, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`I` is defined, `R` is defined, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 1 (set by the loop), `v2` is 1, `r` is the new user input, the output buffer has been flushed, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new user input, the output buffer has been flushed, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`I` is defined, `R` is defined, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new user input, the output buffer has been flushed, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
