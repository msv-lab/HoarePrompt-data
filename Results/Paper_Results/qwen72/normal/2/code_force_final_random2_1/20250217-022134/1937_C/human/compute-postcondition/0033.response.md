The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer provided by the user with the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and n ≠ 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is at least 2 and can go up to 10^4, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 < n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is 2; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0. If `res` (the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`) is `<`, then `min_indices` is a list containing `[1]` if `res` is `<`, otherwise `[0, 1]`. If `res` is not `<`, then `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index, 0]` if `res` is `<`, otherwise `[max_index, 0, 1]`. `res` is the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`**.
