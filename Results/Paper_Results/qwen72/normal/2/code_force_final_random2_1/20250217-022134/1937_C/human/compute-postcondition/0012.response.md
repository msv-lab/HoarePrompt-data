To determine the output state, we need to consider the function call `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` and its impact on the variables. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only infer the changes based on the arguments passed and the return value.

Given:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_index` is 0.
- `res` is `<`.

The function call `res = func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` will assign the return value of `func_1` to `res`. Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `res`, but we can state that `res` will be updated to whatever `func_1` returns.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is 1; `max_index` is 0; `res` is the return value of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`.**
