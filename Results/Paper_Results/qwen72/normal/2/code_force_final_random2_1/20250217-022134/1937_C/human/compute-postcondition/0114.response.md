The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is set to 1.**
