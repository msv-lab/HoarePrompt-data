The only object in the loop head is the variable `kp`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `kp` relative to the integer input provided by the user. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and the integer input from the user must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the final user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.**
