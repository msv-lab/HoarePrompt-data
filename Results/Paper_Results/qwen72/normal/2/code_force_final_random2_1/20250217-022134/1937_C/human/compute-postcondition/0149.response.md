Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set). If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the highest index where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>' throughout the loop.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variable `prev` tracks the highest index where the input `r` was '>'. If `r` was '>' at any point, `prev` will be the highest such index. If `r` was never '>', `prev` will remain 0.
- All other variables (`I`, `R`, `kp`, `g`, `v2`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The output buffer is flushed after each iteration, ensuring that the print statements are visible.
- `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set), as it is not modified within the loop.
