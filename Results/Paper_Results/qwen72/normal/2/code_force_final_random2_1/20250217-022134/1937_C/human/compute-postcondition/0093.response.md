The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1 (since it starts from 1 and the loop has just run once), and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `i < n` to hold true.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `I` and `R` are defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, if the new `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i` and the current value of `r` remains '>', if the new `r` is not '>', the current value of `r` remains unchanged, `i` is 2**
