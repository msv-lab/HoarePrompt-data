Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is `n-1`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` must contain at least one element; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`. If `i` is equal to `max_index`, the current iteration of the loop ends and the next iteration begins, but the values of `n`, `i`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index` remain unchanged. If `res` is equal to `=`, then `min_index` is updated to `i` and `res` remains `=`. If `res` is not equal to `=`, then the values of `n`, `i`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index` remain unchanged.***
