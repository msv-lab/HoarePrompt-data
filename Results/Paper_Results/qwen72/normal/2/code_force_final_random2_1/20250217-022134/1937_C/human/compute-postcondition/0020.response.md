Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is `n-1`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `min_indices` is initialized as a list containing the value of `max_index`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_index`) retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
