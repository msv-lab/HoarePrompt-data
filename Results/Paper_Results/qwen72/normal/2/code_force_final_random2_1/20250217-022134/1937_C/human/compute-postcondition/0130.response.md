To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.
- The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `n-1`.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to its initial value.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `I` is defined.
- `R` is defined.
- `kp` is 2.
- `g` is 0.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- The output buffer has been flushed.
- `r` is the new user input.
- `prev` is 0.
- `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is 0, and `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set)**.
