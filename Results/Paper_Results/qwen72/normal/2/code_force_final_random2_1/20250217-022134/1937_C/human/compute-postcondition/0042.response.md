Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is `n-1`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` must contain at least one element; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`. Additionally, `i` is equal to `max_index`. The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next iteration to begin, but does not change the values of any variables.**
