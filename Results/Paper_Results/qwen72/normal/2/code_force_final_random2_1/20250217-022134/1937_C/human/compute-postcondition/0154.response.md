Functionality: ** The function operates within an interactive environment and does not take any direct input parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each involving a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it finds two indices i and j such that the result of p_i âŠ• p_j (bitwise XOR) is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The function outputs the two indices i and j for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the environment in a state where the input functions `I` and `R` remain defined, and the output buffer has been flushed. **
