Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is `n-1`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` is a list containing the indices where `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned `<` during the loop's execution. If no such indices exist, `min_indices` contains the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`); `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.
Code of the loop:
for i in min_indices:
    if i == max_index:
        continue
    res = func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)
    if res == '=':
        min_index = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is `n-1`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` must contain at least one element; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`. If `i` is equal to `max_index`, the current iteration of the loop ends and the next iteration begins, but the values of `n`, `i`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index` remain unchanged. If `res` is equal to `=`, then `min_index` is updated to `i` and `res` remains `=`. If `res` is not equal to `=`, then the values of `n`, `i`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is the next element in `min_indices`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` must contain at least one element; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`. If `res` (the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`) is equal to `=`, then `min_index` is updated to `i`. If `i` equals `max_index`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is the next element in `min_indices`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` must contain at least one element. If `res` (the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`) is equal to `=`, then `min_index` is updated to `i`. In all cases, `res` is now the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. If `i` equals `max_index`, the loop continues to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
