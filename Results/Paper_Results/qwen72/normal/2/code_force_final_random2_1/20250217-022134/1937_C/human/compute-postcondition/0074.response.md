Output State: **`I` is defined, `R` is defined, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new user input, the output buffer has been flushed, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change any of the variables or their values. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that the output buffer has been flushed.
