Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `I` is defined.
   - `R` is defined.
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the new user input.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - If the new `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i` and the current value of `r` remains '>'.
   - If the new `r` is not '>', the current value of `r` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. We need to assume `i` is a variable that is defined in the context where this print statement is executed.
   - `prev` is 0 unless `r` is '>', in which case `prev` is updated to `i`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `r` is not '>', `prev` remains 0.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will always print `? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}`.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is the value of `i` at the time of execution.
   - `prev` is either 0 or `i` depending on the value of `r`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **? n-1 i n-1 prev (where n is the value of n, i is the value of i, and prev is 0 if r is not '>', or i if r is '>')**
