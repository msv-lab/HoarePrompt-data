Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the final user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.** 

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the new integer input provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
