Functionality: **The function operates within an interactive environment and does not take any direct input parameters. It finds two indices i and j in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 such that the result of p_i âŠ• p_j (bitwise XOR) is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The function returns the two indices i and j.**

This means the function interacts with an environment to query and receive responses about the elements in a permutation, aiming to identify the pair of indices that yield the maximum bitwise XOR value, while adhering to the constraint of making no more than 3n queries. The function ultimately returns these two indices.
