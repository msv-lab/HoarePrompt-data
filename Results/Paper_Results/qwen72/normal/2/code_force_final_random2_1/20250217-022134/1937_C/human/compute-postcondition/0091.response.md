Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is `i`, and if the new `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i` and the current value of `r` remains '>'. If the new `r` is not '>', the current value of `r` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prev` is updated to the current value of `i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
