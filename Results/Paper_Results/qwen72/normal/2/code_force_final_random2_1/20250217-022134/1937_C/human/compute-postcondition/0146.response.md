Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set), `prev` is 2 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 1 if `r` is '<', otherwise `prev` is 0.**
