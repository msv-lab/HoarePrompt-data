To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `I` is defined (but its value is not specified, so it doesn't affect the `print` statement).
   - `R` is defined (but its value is not specified, so it doesn't affect the `print` statement).
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this doesn't affect the `print` statement).
   - `r` is the new user input.
   - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1, and `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).
   - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0, and `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `prev` depends on the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `prev` is 0.
   - `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1.
     - The `print` statement will be: `? [v1] 2 [v1] 1`.
   - If `r` is anything other than '>', then `prev` is 0.
     - The `print` statement will be: `? [v1] 2 [v1] 0`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `v1` is not specified in the initial state, we will use the placeholder `[v1]` to represent its value.
   - The output will depend on the value of `r`.

Output: **? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev] (where [v1] is the value of v1 and [prev] is 1 if r is '>', otherwise [prev] is 0)**
