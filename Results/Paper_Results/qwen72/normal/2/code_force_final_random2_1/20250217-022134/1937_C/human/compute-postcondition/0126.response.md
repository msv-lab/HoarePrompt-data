Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v1` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 3) to `v1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
