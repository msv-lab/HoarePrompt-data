Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is set to 1.** 

The code snippet `r = input('')` prompts the user for input, and the value entered by the user is stored in the variable `r`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. If the user inputs `<`, then `v1` will be set to 1, but this change is conditional and only occurs if the user input is `<`.
