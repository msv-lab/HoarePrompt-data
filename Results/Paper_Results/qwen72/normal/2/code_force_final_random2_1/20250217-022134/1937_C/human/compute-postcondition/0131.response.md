Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `I` is defined (but its value is not specified).
   - `R` is defined (but its value is not specified).
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `r` is the new user input (but its value is not specified).
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1`: According to the initial state, `v1` remains the value it was last set to, or 0 if it was never set. Since no specific value is given for `v1`, we assume it is 0.
   - `i`: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `prev`: The value of `prev` is explicitly given as 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will substitute the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` into the formatted string.
   - The string will be: `? 0 1 0 0`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **? 0 1 0 0**
