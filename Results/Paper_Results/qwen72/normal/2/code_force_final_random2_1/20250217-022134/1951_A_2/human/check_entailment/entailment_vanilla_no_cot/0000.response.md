Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description outlines a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that generates Python files for each `.html` file found in subdirectories whose names fall within a specified range. However, the provided program defines a different function `func_1` that reads input from the user and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions related to the input string. These two programs serve entirely different purposes and are not equivalent. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem description.
