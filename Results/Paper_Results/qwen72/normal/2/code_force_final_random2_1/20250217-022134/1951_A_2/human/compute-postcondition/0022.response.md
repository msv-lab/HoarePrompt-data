The provided Python code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides various details about the environment and variables such as `start`, `end`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

The output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
