Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt1 = s.count('1')` updates the value of `cnt1` to be the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s`. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
