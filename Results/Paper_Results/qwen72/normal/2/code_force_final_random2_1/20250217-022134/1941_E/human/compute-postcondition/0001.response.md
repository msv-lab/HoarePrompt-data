The provided code reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains `m` space-separated integers. These integers are converted to a list of lists called `rows`. Each inner list represents a row of the river, containing the depths of the river cells.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers with specific constraints.
- `rows` is initially undefined.

After executing the code:
- `rows` is now a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0.**
