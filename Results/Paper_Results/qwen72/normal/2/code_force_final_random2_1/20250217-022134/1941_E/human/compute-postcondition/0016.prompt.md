You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, representing the depths of the river cells in a row; d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports, such that 1 <= d <= len(row).
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1, and the last element remains 0; `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports, such that 1 <= d <= len(row); `i` is `d-2`.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1, and the last element is the sum of the minimum values of the sublists of length `d+1` starting from each position in the list, plus the original value of the last element plus the number of iterations (len(row) - d + 1). The variable `i` is `len(row) - 1`.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the sum of the minimum values of the sublists of length `d+1` starting from each position in the list, plus the original value of the last element of `row`, plus the number of iterations (`len(row) - d + 1`).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers (with the first and last elements being 0) and a positive integer `d`. It returns the sum of the minimum values of sublists of length `d+1` starting from each position in `row`, plus the last element of `row`, plus the number of iterations (`len(row) - d + 1`).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of the minimum values of the sublists of length `d+1` starting from each position in the list, plus the original value of the last element of `row`, plus the number of iterations (`len(row) - d + 1`).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
