You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

- Program:
from typing import List
#Function 1:
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
    return row[-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from input, followed by `n` lines of `m` integers each, representing the depths of river cells. It processes these inputs to calculate the minimum cost of a sequence of `k` consecutive rows, where the cost of each row is determined by a helper function `func_1`. The function then prints the minimum cost of any such sequence of `k` rows. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs`, with `total_costs` containing the sums of every consecutive `k` elements in `costs`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a flaw in `func_1` where it incorrectly calculates the cost of placing supports. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The current implementation only considers the minimum value within a sliding window of size `d`, but it does not ensure that the supports are placed at valid positions according to the distance constraint.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 100 1 0
```
Here, the river grid is:
```
0 1 100 1 0
```
The maximum distance between supports is `2`. According to the problem description, the valid positions for supports are:
- (1, 1) and (1, 5) (required by the problem)
- (1, 3) (since the distance between (1, 1) and (1, 3) is 1, and the distance between (1, 3) and (1, 5) is also 1)

However, the current implementation of `func_1` will calculate the cost as follows:
- `row[0] = 1` (cost of placing a support at (1, 1))
- `row[1] = 2` (cost of placing a support at (1, 2))
- `row[2] = 101` (cost of placing a support at (1, 3))
- `row[3] = 2` (cost of placing a support at (1, 4))
- `row[4] = 1` (cost of placing a support at (1, 5))

The function will return `1 + 2 + 101 + 2 + 1 = 107`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the valid placement of supports according to the distance constraint.

The correct minimum cost should be `1 + 101 + 1 = 103` (placing supports at (1, 1), (1, 3), and (1, 5)).

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
