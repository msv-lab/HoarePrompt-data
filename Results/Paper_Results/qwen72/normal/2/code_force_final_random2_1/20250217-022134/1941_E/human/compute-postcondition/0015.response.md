The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `row` and `d`. `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, representing the depths of the river cells in a row. `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports, with the constraint that 1 <= d <= len(row). 

The function returns the sum of the minimum values of the sublists of length `d+1` starting from each position in the list, plus the original value of the last element of `row`, plus the number of iterations (`len(row) - d + 1`).
