Reasoning:

The original assessment identifies a critical flaw in the `func_1` function, which is responsible for calculating the cost of placing supports in a single row. The issue lies in how the function handles the distance constraint between supports. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the supports are placed at valid positions according to the distance constraint `d`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Distance Constraint Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over the row and updates the cost of placing supports. However, it only considers the minimum value within a sliding window of size `d` and adds 1 to the cost. This approach does not guarantee that the supports are placed at valid positions where the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

2. **Counterexample**:
   - The counterexample provided in the original assessment is valid:
     ```
     1
     3 5 1 2
     0 1 100 1 0
     ```
     - The correct minimum cost should be `1 + 101 + 1 = 103` (placing supports at (1, 1), (1, 3), and (1, 5)).
     - The current implementation will return `1 + 2 + 101 + 2 + 1 = 107`, which is incorrect.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly handle the distance constraint, the function should use dynamic programming to ensure that the supports are placed at valid positions. For each cell, the function should consider the minimum cost of placing a support at the previous valid positions within the distance constraint `d`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the distance constraint between supports, leading to incorrect cost calculations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
