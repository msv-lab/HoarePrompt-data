### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the `func_1` function. The issue lies in how the function calculates the cost of placing supports while ensuring that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function iterates over the row and updates the cost of placing supports.
- For the first `d-1` elements, it simply adds 1 to the depth.
- For the remaining elements, it calculates the cost as the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus the current depth plus 1.

However, this approach does not ensure that the supports are placed at valid positions according to the distance constraint. Specifically, the function does not check if the distance between the current support and the next support is within the allowed distance `d`.

#### Counterexample:
The counterexample provided in the original assessment is valid:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 100 1 0
```
- The river grid is:
  ```
  0 1 100 1 0
  ```
- The maximum distance between supports is `2`.
- Valid positions for supports are:
  - (1, 1) and (1, 5) (required by the problem)
  - (1, 3) (since the distance between (1, 1) and (1, 3) is 1, and the distance between (1, 3) and (1, 5) is also 1)

The current implementation of `func_1` will calculate the cost as follows:
- `row[0] = 1` (cost of placing a support at (1, 1))
- `row[1] = 2` (cost of placing a support at (1, 2))
- `row[2] = 101` (cost of placing a support at (1, 3))
- `row[3] = 2` (cost of placing a support at (1, 4))
- `row[4] = 1` (cost of placing a support at (1, 5))

The function will return `1 + 2 + 101 + 2 + 1 = 107`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the valid placement of supports according to the distance constraint.

The correct minimum cost should be `1 + 101 + 1 = 103` (placing supports at (1, 1), (1, 3), and (1, 5)).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.

Final: **False**
