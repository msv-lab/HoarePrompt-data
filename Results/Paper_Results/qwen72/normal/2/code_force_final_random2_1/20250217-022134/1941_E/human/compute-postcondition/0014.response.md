Functionality: ** The function reads four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from input, followed by `n` lines of `m` integers each, representing the depths of river cells. It processes these inputs to calculate the minimum cost of a sequence of `k` consecutive rows, where the cost of each row is determined by a helper function `func_1`. The function then prints the minimum cost of any such sequence of `k` rows. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs`, with `total_costs` containing the sums of every consecutive `k` elements in `costs`. **
