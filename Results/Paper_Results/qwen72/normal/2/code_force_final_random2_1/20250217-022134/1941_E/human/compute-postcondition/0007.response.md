The code appends the sum of the slice `costs[i:i + k]` to the list `total_costs`. Given that `i` is 1, the slice `costs[1:1 + k]` (or `costs[1:k + 1]`) is taken, and its sum is appended to `total_costs`.

Since `total_costs` initially contains the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, after executing the code, `total_costs` will contain two elements: the sum of the first `k` elements and the sum of the elements from index 1 to index `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is greater than `k - 1`, `i` is 1, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements from index 1 to index `k` of `costs`.**
