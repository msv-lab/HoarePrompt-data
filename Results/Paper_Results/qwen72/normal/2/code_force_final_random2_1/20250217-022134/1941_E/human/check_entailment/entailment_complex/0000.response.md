Reasoning:  
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the cost of building a bridge on a single row of the river.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1 to account for the cost of installing supports.
   - For the remaining elements, it finds the minimum cost of installing supports within a window of size `d+1` and adds 1 to the original depth.
   - The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost of building the bridge on that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for a single test case.
   - It constructs a list of rows representing the river depths.
   - It calculates the cost of building a bridge on each row using `func_1`.
   - It then finds the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of every possible sequence of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The main block of the program iterates over the number of test cases and calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program seems to correctly implement the required logic and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
