Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports for a single row. However, the logic within `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the way it updates the cost of each cell does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem, particularly the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case. It calls `func_1` for each row to compute the cost of building a bridge on that row. Then, it calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and prints the minimum cost. However, because `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution will also be incorrect.

To fix the issue, the logic in `func_1` needs to be revised to correctly handle the placement of supports according to the given constraints. Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
from typing import List
import math

# Function 1:
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    # Initialize the DP table
    dp = [math.inf] * len(row)
    dp[0] = row[0] + 1  # Cost of placing a support at the first column
    dp[-1] = row[-1] + 1  # Cost of placing a support at the last column

    # Precompute the minimum cost for each position
    left_min = [math.inf] * len(row)
    right_min = [math.inf] * len(row)

    for i in range(1, len(row)):
        left_min[i] = min(left_min[i-1], dp[i-1])
    
    for i in range(len(row) - 2, -1, -1):
        right_min[i] = min(right_min[i+1], dp[i+1])

    for i in range(1, len(row) - 1):
        dp[i] = min(left_min[max(0, i - d)], right_min[min(i + d, len(row) - 1)]) + row[i] + 1

    return dp[-1]

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k, d = map(int, input().split())
        rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))]
        results.append(min(total_costs))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
func_2()
```

This corrected version of `func_1` uses dynamic programming to ensure that the cost of placing supports is calculated correctly, taking into account the maximum distance `d` between supports. The overall structure of `func_2` remains the same, but now it uses the corrected `func_1` to compute the minimum costs.
