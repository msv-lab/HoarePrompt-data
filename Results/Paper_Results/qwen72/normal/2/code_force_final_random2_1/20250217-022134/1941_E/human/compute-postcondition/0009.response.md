The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `costs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `costs` minus `(k - 1)`. If `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than `k - 1`, and `costs` is a list of length `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Since `n` is greater than `k - 1`, and `n` is the length of `costs`, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is greater than `k - 1`, `i` is 2, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of elements from index 1 to index `k` of `costs`.**
