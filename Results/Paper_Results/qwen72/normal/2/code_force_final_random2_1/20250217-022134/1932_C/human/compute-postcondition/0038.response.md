The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a` and the string `s`. `m` is a positive integer. `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. 

The function returns a list `ans` which is the reversed list of cumulative products. These products are derived from elements in the list `b`, where each element in `b` is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'). The final list `ans` contains the cumulative products of these elements in reverse order.
