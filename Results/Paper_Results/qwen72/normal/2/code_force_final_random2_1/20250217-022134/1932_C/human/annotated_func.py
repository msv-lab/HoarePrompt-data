#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

    b = []

    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'), `l` is `n`, and `r` is `-1`.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in the reversed `b`, `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in the reversed list `b`. Each element in `b` is selected from the list `a` based on the corresponding character in the string `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'). The final list `ans` is calculated as the cumulative products of these elements in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of elements selected from `a` based on the instructions in `s`. Specifically, for each character in `s`, if the character is 'L', an element is taken from the left end of `a`; if the character is 'R', an element is taken from the right end of `a`. These elements are then used to compute the cumulative products in reverse order, and the resulting list is returned in its original order.
