Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `v` and `p`, `p` is the product of the first two elements in the reversed `b`, `v` is the second element in the reversed `b`.** 

The code `ans.append(p)` adds the value of `p` (which is the product of the first two elements in the reversed `b`) to the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
