Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the appropriate elements based on the first character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is 'L', `b` contains the first two elements of `a`, `l` is 2, and `r` is `n - 1`. If the first character of `s` is 'R', `b` contains the last two elements of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 2`. If the second character of `s` is 'L', `r` remains unchanged. If the second character of `s` is 'R', `r` is decreased by 1.***
