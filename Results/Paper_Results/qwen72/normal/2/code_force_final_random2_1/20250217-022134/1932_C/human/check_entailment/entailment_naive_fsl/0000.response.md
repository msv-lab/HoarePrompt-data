Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` before removing an element. Instead, it appends the element to be removed to the list `b` and then computes the product in reverse order. This approach fails to meet the requirement of computing the product of the current state of the array `a` before each removal.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
24 24 8 1
```

The actual output is incorrect because the program does not compute the product of the current state of the array before each removal. For example, after the first command 'L', the array becomes `[1, 4, 2]`, and the product should be `8 % 6 = 2`, but the program incorrectly outputs `24`.
