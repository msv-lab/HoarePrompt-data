Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that iterates over the number of test cases.

2. **Function Call**: For each test case, the function `func_1` is called with the appropriate arguments: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`.

3. **Processing Commands**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` as they are removed according to the commands in `s`.
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are used to track the left and right ends of the array `a`.
   - The loop iterates over each character in `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented.
     - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented.
   - This part correctly simulates the removal of elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`.

4. **Cumulative Products**:
   - The function then calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
   - A variable `p` is initialized to 1 to keep track of the product.
   - The loop iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order, multiplying `p` by each element and appending the result to `ans`.
   - The final list `ans` is returned in its original order by reversing it.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results of each test case as required.

However, there is a critical issue in the implementation:
- The function `func_1` does not take the modulus `m` into account when calculating the cumulative products. The problem statement requires that the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` should be taken modulo `m` at each step.

To fix this, the line `p = p * v` should be changed to `p = (p * v) % m`.

Given this issue, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
