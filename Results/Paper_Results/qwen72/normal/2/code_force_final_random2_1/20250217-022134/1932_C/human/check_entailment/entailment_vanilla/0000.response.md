### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands and compute the required remainders.

3. **Command Processing**:
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the left and right ends of the array.
   - It iterates through the command string `s` and appends the appropriate element to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - This part correctly simulates the removal of elements from the array.

4. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the remaining elements.
   - It iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, multiplying the current product `p` by the current element and appending the result to the list `ans`.
   - This ensures that the product is calculated correctly for each step, and the remainders are computed.

5. **Output**:
   - The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the remainders in the correct order.

### Issues:
- **Product Calculation**:
  - The program does not take the remainder modulo `m` at each step of the product calculation. This can lead to overflow issues and incorrect results for large products.
  - The correct approach would be to take the remainder modulo `m` after each multiplication to ensure the product remains manageable and accurate.

### Corrected Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = (p * v) % m  # Take the remainder modulo m at each step
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it does not take the remainder modulo `m` at each step of the product calculation, which can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
