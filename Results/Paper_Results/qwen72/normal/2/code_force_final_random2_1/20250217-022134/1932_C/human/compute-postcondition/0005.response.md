Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`. The first character of `s` is 'L'.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(a[l])` adds the element at index `l` of the list `a` to the list `b`.
- Initially, `b` was an empty list, and `l` is 0.
- After executing the code, `b` now contains the first element of `a`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.
- The first character of `s` is still 'L'.
