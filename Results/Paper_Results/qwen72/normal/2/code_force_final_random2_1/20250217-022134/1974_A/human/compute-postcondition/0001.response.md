To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`) are not directly involved in the loop's condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- For each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99
- `n` is an input integer

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be set to 0 by the loop itself when it starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
