Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has some logical flaws that prevent it from correctly calculating the minimum number of screens required in all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of 2x2 Icons**: The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`t`) by dividing `b` by 2 and adding 1 if there's a remainder. This is not always correct because the number of 2x2 icons can be placed in a way that minimizes the number of screens used. For example, placing 3 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen, but the program might incorrectly calculate it as needing 2 screens.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Space**: The program calculates the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This assumes that each screen has 15 available cells after placing 2x2 icons, which is incorrect. A screen has 15 cells in total, but placing a 2x2 icon removes 4 cells, not just 4 cells per screen.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining 1x1 Icons**: The program then tries to fit the remaining 1x1 icons into the remaining space. However, the calculation `t2 = a - t1` and the subsequent logic to add more screens is flawed. It does not correctly account for the fact that a screen can have up to 15 cells, and the remaining space should be calculated based on the actual number of cells left after placing 2x2 icons.

To fix these issues, a more accurate approach would be to:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons first.
- Calculate the remaining space on those screens.
- Place the 1x1 icons in the remaining space, and if there are still 1x1 icons left, calculate the additional screens needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b * 4 + 14) // 15
        
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens
        remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        screens_for_1x1 = (a - remaining_space + 14) // 15
        
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        
        print(total_screens)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of screens is calculated accurately for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons.
