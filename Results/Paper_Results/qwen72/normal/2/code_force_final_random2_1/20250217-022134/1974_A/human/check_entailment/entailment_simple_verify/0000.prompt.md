You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the loop has processed `n` pairs of inputs (`a`, `b`). For each iteration, the variable `t` is updated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, for each pair of inputs (`a`, `b`), `t` is initially set to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. Then, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or `t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0`, where `t2` is `a - t1`. The final value of `t` for each iteration is printed. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `n` is the total number of iterations performed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is zero correctly. Specifically, when `b` is 0, the initial calculation of `t` (number of screens) is set to 0, which is incorrect because even if there are no 2x2 icons, the 1x1 icons still need to be placed on screens. For example, if the input is `15 0`, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of screens as 1 instead of the correct value of 1.

To fix this, the initial value of `t` should be set to 1 if `b` is 0, and the logic for calculating the number of screens should be adjusted accordingly.
