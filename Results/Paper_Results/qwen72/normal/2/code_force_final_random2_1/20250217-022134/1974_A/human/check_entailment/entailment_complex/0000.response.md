Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading the values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`t`). This is done by dividing `b` by 2 and adding 1 if `b` is odd. This is correct because each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells available (5 rows * 3 columns).

3. **Calculation of Remaining Cells**:
   - The program then calculates the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons (`t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`). This is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells.

4. **Handling 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells (`t1`) are sufficient to accommodate all 1x1 icons (`a`), the number of screens (`t`) remains unchanged.
   - If the remaining cells are insufficient, the program calculates the additional screens needed (`t2 = a - t1`). It then adds the ceiling of `t2 / 15` to `t` to account for the additional screens required.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case, which is the correct output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
