Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd, plus `t2 // 15 + 1`, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4` (using the original value of `t`), `t2` is equal to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)` (using the original value of `t`).**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
- The original value of `t` is used to compute `t2` before updating `t`.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `t1`) remain unchanged or their values are derived from the original values of `t` and `t2`.
