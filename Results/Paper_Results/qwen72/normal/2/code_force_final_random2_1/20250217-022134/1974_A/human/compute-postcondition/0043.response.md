Output State: **`a` is an integer (specifically, `a` is now the integer value of the first part of the input), `b` is an integer representing the second part of the input, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is equal to `b`.**

The variable `t` is assigned the value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
