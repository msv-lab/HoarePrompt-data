The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the description, it seems to handle multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers, `x` and `y`. The function is expected to process `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers within the range 0 to 99.

However, since the specific output or behavior of the function for each test case is not provided, I can only infer that the function processes these test cases and likely returns some form of result or results based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10,000), and for each test case, it takes two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). The function returns a result or results based on the processing of these test cases.**
