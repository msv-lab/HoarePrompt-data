Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer representing the second part of the input, `t` is now equal to `b // 2`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, if `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is greater than or equal to `a`, if `t1` is less than `a`, then `t` is updated as follows: if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15`; otherwise, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`, `t2` remains `a - t1`, and if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t2` is a multiple of 15; otherwise, `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t // 2`, which means `t` is now equal to `b // 2`.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions related to `t1` and `t2` remain the same, but they now depend on the new value of `t` which is `b // 2`.
