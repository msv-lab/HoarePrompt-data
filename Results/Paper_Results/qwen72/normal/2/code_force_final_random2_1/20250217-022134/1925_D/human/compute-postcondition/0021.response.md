To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop.
- `j` is `m-1`.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `f` is an input integer.
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `cn2`:**
   \[
   \text{cn2} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}
   \]
   This is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items without regard to order.

2. **Calculate `p`:**
   \[
   \text{p} = \frac{2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{\text{gcd}}
   \]
   Here, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

3. **Calculate `q`:**
   \[
   \text{q} = \frac{2 \times \text{cn2}}{\text{gcd}}
   \]

4. **Calculate the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`:**
   \[
   \text{q_inv} = \text{pow}(q, -1, M)
   \]
   This computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`.

5. **Compute the final result:**
   \[
   \text{result} = (\text{p} \times \text{q_inv}) \% M
   \]

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the above computation, which is the value of `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, and `M` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the given formula and the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the modular arithmetic operation described.

Output: **(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) (where p and q are calculated based on the given formulas and gcd, and M is the modulus)**
