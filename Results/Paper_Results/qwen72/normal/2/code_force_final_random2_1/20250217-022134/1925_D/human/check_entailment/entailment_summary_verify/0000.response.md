### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines with `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`: Pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Expected Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion can be calculated as follows:
     - For each pair of friends, the probability of choosing that pair in any given excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
     - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
     - The expected increase in friendship value for a pair of friends over `k` excursions is the sum of the probabilities of choosing that pair in each excursion, multiplied by the number of excursions remaining after the current one.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution calculates the expected value using the following steps:
1. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - `sum_f` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
2. **Total Number of Pairs:**
   - `cn2` is the total number of possible pairs of children, calculated as \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]
   - The expected value is then calculated as \(\frac{p}{q}\) and printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Correctness of the Formula:
- **Initial Sum Contribution:**
  - The term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f}\) accounts for the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends, multiplied by the number of excursions and the total number of pairs.
- **Incremental Increase Contribution:**
  - The term \(m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\) attempts to account for the incremental increase in friendship values over the excursions. However, this term is incorrect because it does not properly reflect the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over the excursions.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach should involve calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over the excursions. The expected increase for a pair of friends is the sum of the probabilities of choosing that pair in each excursion, multiplied by the number of excursions remaining after the current one.

The correct formula for the expected value should be:
\[
\text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}} \right)
\]

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided solution does not correctly handle the incremental increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over the excursions. The formula used in the program is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
