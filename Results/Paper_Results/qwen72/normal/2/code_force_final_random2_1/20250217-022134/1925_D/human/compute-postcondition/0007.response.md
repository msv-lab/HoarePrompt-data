Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sum_f += f` adds the value of `f` to `sum_f`. Initially, `sum_f` was 0, so after executing the code, `sum_f` is now equal to `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
