The code snippet `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f` after converting them to integers. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**
