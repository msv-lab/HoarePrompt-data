Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions correctly. Specifically, the formula used in the program to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values is incorrect. The program calculates `p` as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, which does not accurately reflect the expected increase in friendship values for subsequent excursions.

A correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion and summing these values appropriately. The current implementation does not correctly account for the incremental increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over the k excursions. This leads to incorrect results for the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
