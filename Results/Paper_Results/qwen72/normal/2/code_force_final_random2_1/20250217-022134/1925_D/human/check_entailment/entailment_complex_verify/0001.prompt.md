You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` pairs `(a_i, b_i, f_i)`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these inputs and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the pairs `(a_i, b_i, f_i)`. It computes a result using these values and prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions.
   - Each excursion involves selecting a pair of children, and if they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` (number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions).
   - It then reads the friendship values for each pair of friends and sums them up in `sum_f`.
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is calculated as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - Finally, it computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) and prints the result.

3. **Mathematical Derivation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions can be derived as follows:
     - The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in one excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
     - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair of friends in one excursion is \(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
     - Over `k` excursions, the expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair of friends is \(k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
     - The total expected increase in the friendship value for all pairs of friends is \(k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot m\).
     - The initial sum of friendship values is `sum_f`.
     - Therefore, the total expected value is \(k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot m + k \cdot \text{sum\_f}\).

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of pairs `cn2`.
   - It correctly calculates the sum of initial friendship values `sum_f`.
   - It correctly calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - It correctly simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their gcd.
   - It correctly computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are no pairs of friends (`m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value is 0.
   - The program handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the expected value is the sum of the initial friendship value plus the increase over `k` excursions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation for solving the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
