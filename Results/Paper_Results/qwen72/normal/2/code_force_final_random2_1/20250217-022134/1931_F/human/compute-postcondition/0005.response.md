The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, and the current value of `m` is 1. However, these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement, as the statement does not depend on any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet will be:

Output: **yes**
