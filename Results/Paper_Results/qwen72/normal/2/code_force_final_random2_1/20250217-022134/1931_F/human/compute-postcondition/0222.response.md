Postcondition: **`l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` is greater than the number of iterations, `idx1` is not -1, if `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, if `m` is equal to 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the input, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
