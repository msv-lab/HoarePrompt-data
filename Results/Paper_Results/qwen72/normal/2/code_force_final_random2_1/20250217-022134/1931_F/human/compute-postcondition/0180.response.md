Output State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 2`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the same conditions apply as before. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues. `idx2` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- The new state includes the updated value of `idx2` while maintaining all the initial conditions.
