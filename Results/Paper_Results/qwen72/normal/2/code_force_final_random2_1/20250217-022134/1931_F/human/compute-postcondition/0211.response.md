Output State: **`l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` is greater than the number of iterations, `idx1` is not -1. If `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. `val` is an empty list. `idx1` is less than `idx2`. `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position `idx1`. `l` is now a reference to the list `l2`.**
