The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is at least 3.
- `val` is a list containing at least two tuples.
- `a3` is the first integer from the second tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the second tuple in `val`.

However, none of these variables or their values are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **no**
