Postcondition: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is an empty list, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value of `i` before the loop terminates), `a3` is the first integer from the latest user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest user input, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
