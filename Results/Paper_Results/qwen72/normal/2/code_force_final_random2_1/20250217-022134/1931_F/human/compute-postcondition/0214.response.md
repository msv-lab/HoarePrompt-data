The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`.

Given the initial state:
- `l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2.
- `n` is greater than the number of iterations.
- `idx1` is not -1.
- If `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.

After executing the code:
- The list `l1` now includes the element `a1` at the index `idx2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` is greater than the number of iterations, `idx1` is not -1, if `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` now includes the element `a1` at the index `idx2`.**
