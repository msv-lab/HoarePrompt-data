Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the following k lines contains n integers `a_{ij}`, where 1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n and all `a_{ij}` are distinct, representing the order of participants shown to the participant `a_{i0}`. The sum of n · k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and all the authors of the screenshots are different.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m == 1:
        input()
        print('yes')
        continue
    a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())
    a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())
    l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]
    l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]
    if l11 != l22:
        for _ in range(m - 2):
            input()
        print('no')
        continue
    idx1 = idx2 = -1
    p1 = p2 = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
            break
        if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
                idx1 = idx2 = i
                break
            else:
                if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                    idx1 = i
                    p1 = 1
                else:
                    idx2 = i
                    p2 = 1
                if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                    break
    val = []
    if idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1:
        idx1 = n - 2
    if idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1:
        idx2 = n - 2
    if idx1 < idx2:
        l2.insert(idx1, a2)
        l = l2
    elif idx1 > idx2:
        l1.insert(idx2, a1)
        l = l1
    else:
        if m == 2:
            print('yes')
            continue
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2):
            l1.insert(idx2, a1)
            l = l1
        else:
            l2.insert(idx1, a2)
            l = l2
        val.append((a3, l3))
        m -= 1
    for _ in range(m - 2):
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        val.append((a3, l3))
    for a3, l3 in val:
        if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
            print('no')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, and no 'no' was printed, so 'yes' will be printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed. For each tuple, `a3` is the first integer, and `l3` is the list of the remaining integers. The loop will print 'yes' if for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` contains all elements of the list `l` except for `a3`. Otherwise, the loop will print 'no' and terminate early.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If all tuples in `val` satisfy the condition `l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]`, the output will be 'yes'. If any tuple does not satisfy this condition, the output will be 'no' and the loop will terminate early. The values of `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `l` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
