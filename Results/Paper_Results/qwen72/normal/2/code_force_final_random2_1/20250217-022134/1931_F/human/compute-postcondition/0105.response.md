Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` and `a1` are input integers, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, indicating the positions where `l1` and `l2` differ by `a1` and `a2`. `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, depending on whether a mismatch was found and adjusted. The loop has completed all iterations, and `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early due to conditions being met. `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is non-negative, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`, indicating that `l2` differs from `l1` by `a2` at position `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is a reference to `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. If `idx1 >= idx2`, `l1` is updated with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2` or if `idx1 <= idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, and `l` is set to `l1`. If `idx1 <= idx2` and `m` is 1, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `idx1 <= idx2` and `m` is not 1 and the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l2` is updated with `a2` inserted at position `idx1`, and `l` is set to `l2`.***
