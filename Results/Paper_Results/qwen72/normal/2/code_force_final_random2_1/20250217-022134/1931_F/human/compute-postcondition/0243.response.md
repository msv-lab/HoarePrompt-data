To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `a3` and `l3` as they are part of the tuple being iterated over from the list `val`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2.
- `a3` is the first integer from the last input.
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the last input.
- `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, with the total number of tuples equal to `m - 2`.

For the loop to execute, `val` must contain at least one tuple. This means `m - 2` must be at least 1, so `m` must be at least 3. Additionally, `a3` and `l3` should be set to the values of the first tuple in `val` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first tuple in `val`**
