Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `val` is a list that contains at least one more tuple.
- Each tuple in `val` consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers.
- `a3` and `l3` are the first elements of the next tuple in `val`.
- The program checks if `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.
- If `l3` is not equal to this list comprehension, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('no')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'no'`.
- The initial state provides conditions under which the program might break out of a loop or if statement, but it does not affect the content of the `print` statement itself.
- Since the `print` statement is not conditional and always executes, it will always print the string `'no'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'no'` regardless of the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **no**
