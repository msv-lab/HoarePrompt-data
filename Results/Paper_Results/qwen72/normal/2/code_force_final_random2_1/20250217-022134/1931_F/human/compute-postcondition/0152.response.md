To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, and the program has waited for user input for each iteration.
- If `l11` is equal to `l22`, no changes are made and the program continues as usual.
- `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`.
- For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `n`.
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.
- The other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`) and the conditions involving `l11`, `l22`, and `m` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
