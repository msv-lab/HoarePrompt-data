The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.

Given the initial state:
- `l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2.
- `n` is greater than the number of iterations.
- `idx1` is not -1.
- If `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.
- If `m` is equal to 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

After executing the code snippet:
- `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `l3` is assigned a list of integers from the remaining parts of the input.

The values of the other variables (`l22`, `l11`, `m`, `n`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` is greater than the number of iterations, `idx1` is not -1, if `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, if `m` is equal to 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the input.**
