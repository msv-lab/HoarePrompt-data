Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is 2, `a1` and `a2` are input integers, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, indicating the positions where `l1` and `l2` differ by `a1` and `a2`. `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, depending on whether a mismatch was found and adjusted. The loop has completed all iterations, and `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early due to conditions being met. `val` is an empty list. If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is non-negative, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`, indicating that `l2` differs from `l1` by `a2` at position `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is 2, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. `a3` is an input integer, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` is updated with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, and `l` is set to `l1`. Otherwise, `l2` is updated with `a2` inserted at position `idx1`, and `l` is set to `l2`.**
