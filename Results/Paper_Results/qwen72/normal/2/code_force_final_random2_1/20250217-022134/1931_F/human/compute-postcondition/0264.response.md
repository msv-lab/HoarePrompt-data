The code snippet `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a2` and the rest to the list `l2`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is at least 3
- `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input
- `a1` is the first integer from the user input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input

After executing the code snippet, the following changes occur:
- `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input
- `l2` is assigned a list of the remaining integers from the new user input

The other variables (`m`, `val`, `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input.**
