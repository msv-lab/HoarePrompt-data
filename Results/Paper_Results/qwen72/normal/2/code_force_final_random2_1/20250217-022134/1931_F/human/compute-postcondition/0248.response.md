The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a3` and `l3`, which are derived from the list `val`. The loop iterates over each tuple in `val`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another tuple in `val` after the current one.

At the end of the last iteration, `val` contains at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first tuple in `val`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must contain at least two tuples. After the last iteration, the next tuple in `val` will be unpacked into `a3` and `l3`. Therefore, `a3` will be the first integer from the second tuple in `val`, and `l3` will be the list of the remaining integers from the second tuple in `val`.

State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing at least two tuples, `a3` is the first integer from the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the second tuple in `val`.**
