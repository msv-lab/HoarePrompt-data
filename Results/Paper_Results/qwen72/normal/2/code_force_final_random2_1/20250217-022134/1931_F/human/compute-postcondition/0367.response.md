Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new input, `m` is greater than 3, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous value, `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `l` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The line `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` assigns the first integer from the new input to `a3` and the remaining integers to the list `l3`.
- The initial state specifies that `a3` is the first integer from the new input and `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new input, which remains true after the code execution.
- The value of `m` is still greater than 3.
- The tuple `(a3, l3)` is appended to the previous value of `val`, so `val` now includes this new tuple.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
