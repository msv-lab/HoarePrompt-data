Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)` from the initial state.**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` already contains the tuple `(a3, l3)` from the initial state, after the execution, `val` now contains two identical tuples `(a3, l3)`. The values of `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.
