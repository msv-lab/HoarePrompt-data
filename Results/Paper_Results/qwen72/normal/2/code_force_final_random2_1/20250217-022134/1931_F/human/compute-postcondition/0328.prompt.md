Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` and `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative integers, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If none of these conditions are met, the program continues executing the next part of the code.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `i_old + 1`, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` is `i_old + 1`, `idx2` is `i_old + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] != a2` or `l2[i + p2] != a1`, and if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration or statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `i_old + 2`, and `i` is less than `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] != a1`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx2` is set to `i_old + 2` and `p2` is 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, the program continues with the next iteration or statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
