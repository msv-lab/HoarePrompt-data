Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, and the program has waited for user input for each iteration. If `l11` is equal to `l22`, no changes are made and the program continues as usual. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then: If `l1[i + p1]` is `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is `a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, `p1` and `p2` remain 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, they are set to `i`, `p1` and `p2` are set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is `a2`, `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` remains -1, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` remains 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not `a2`, `idx1` remains -1, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` remains 0, and `p2` is set to 1. In all cases, the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`, and either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 2`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the same conditions apply as before. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, the loop continues under the same conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` is greater than 2, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 3`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
