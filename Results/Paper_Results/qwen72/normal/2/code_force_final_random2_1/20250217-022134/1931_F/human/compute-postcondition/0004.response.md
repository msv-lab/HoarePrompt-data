The `input()` function is called, which waits for user input. Since no variable is assigned the result of `input()`, the input itself does not affect the state of the program. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, and the current value of `m` is 1.**
