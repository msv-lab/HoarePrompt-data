Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly process scenarios where more than two users post screenshots, and the relative positions of the users in the screenshots do not align with the expected order.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 3 4 5
3 1 2 4 5
```

In this case:
- User 1 sees the order `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- User 2 sees the order `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`.
- User 3 sees the order `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`.

The program should output "NO" because there is no consistent order of participants that would result in these three screenshots. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" for this input.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
