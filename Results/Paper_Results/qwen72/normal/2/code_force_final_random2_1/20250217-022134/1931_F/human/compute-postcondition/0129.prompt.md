Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, where each `a3` is the first integer from the corresponding new input, and each `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the corresponding new input.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of all elements in `l` except `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original flow.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing normally.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
