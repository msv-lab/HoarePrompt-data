Output State: **`l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` is greater than the number of iterations, `idx1` is not -1, if `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` now includes the element `a1` at the index `idx2`, `l` is now a reference to `l1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = l1` assigns the reference of `l1` to `l`.
- All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
