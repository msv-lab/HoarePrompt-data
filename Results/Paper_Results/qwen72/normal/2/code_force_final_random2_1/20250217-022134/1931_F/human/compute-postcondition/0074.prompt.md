Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` and `a1` are input integers, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then: If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, and the current value of `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, and the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` and `a1` are input integers, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the following conditions apply: If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, and the current value of `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, and the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the following actions occur: If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` but `l2[i + p2] != a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is 1. If `i + max(1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution normally. If `l1[i + p1] != a2` but `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is 1. If `i + max(p1, 1)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution normally. If `l1[i + p1] != a2` and `l2[i + p2] != a1`, then neither `idx1` nor `idx2` are updated, and the program continues execution normally. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative at any point, the program exits the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, the program continues execution normally.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
