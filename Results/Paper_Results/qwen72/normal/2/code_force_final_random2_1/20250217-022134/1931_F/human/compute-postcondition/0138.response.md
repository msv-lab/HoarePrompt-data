The code snippet `l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]` filters the list `l1` to exclude any occurrences of the value `a2`.

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is greater than 0
  - `n` is the first integer from the input
  - `m` is the second integer from the input
  - `a1` is the first integer from the new input
  - `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input
  - `a2` is the first integer from the latest input
  - `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input
  - `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
  - `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
  - `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative
  - `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1
  - `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early
  - `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`. If `m` is 1, the loop continues to the next iteration.

- **Impact of the Code:**
  - The list `l11` is updated to contain only the elements from `l1` that are not equal to `a2`.

- **Output State:**
  - `t` is greater than 0
  - `n` is the first integer from the input
  - `m` is the second integer from the input
  - `a1` is the first integer from the new input
  - `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input
  - `a2` is the first integer from the latest input
  - `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input
  - `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
  - `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
  - `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative
  - `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1
  - `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early
  - `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`. If `m` is 1, the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`. If `m` is 1, the loop continues to the next iteration.**
