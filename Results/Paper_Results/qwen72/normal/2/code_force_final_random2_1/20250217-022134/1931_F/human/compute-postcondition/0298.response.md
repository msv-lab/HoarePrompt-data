Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative integers, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the program continues executing the next part of the code.***
