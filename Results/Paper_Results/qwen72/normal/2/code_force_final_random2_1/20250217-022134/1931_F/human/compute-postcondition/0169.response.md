Output State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`. `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`, meaning both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative. `p1` is set to 1 and `p2` is set to 1. The current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`, and either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
