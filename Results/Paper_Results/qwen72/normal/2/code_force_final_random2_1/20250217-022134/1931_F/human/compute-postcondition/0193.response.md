The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. This does not affect the other variables or conditions specified in the initial state. The only change is the new value of `p1`.

Output State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` must be greater than 2, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` (which is now 1) and `p2` is equal to `n - 3`, `i` is incremented by 1, `idx1` is equal to `i`. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` (which is now 1) and `p2` equals `n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
