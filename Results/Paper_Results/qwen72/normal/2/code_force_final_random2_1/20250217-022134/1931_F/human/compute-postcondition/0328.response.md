Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value of `i` before the loop terminates), `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 depending on whether `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n - 1` times, but it can terminate early if certain conditions are met.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n - 2` when the loop completes all iterations, unless it breaks early.
- `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the same index `i` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` are found, otherwise they remain -1.
- `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` is found, respectively, otherwise they remain 0.
- The other variables (`m`, `val`, `t`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
