Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided solution, let's re-evaluate the logic and the problem statement in detail.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key to determining the winner lies in the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of coins in the wallets.

### Solution Logic:
- The provided solution uses the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0` to determine the winner.
- This condition checks if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even.

### Reasoning for the Condition:
- **Even Difference**: If the difference `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob will win.
- **Odd Difference**: If the difference `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice will win.

### Explanation:
- **Even Difference**: If the difference is even, the number of moves required to reach a state where one player cannot make a move will be even. Since Alice starts, she will make the first move, and Bob will make the last move, leading to Bob's win.
- **Odd Difference**: If the difference is odd, the number of moves required to reach a state where one player cannot make a move will be odd. Since Alice starts, she will make the last move, leading to Alice's win.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - `abs(1 - 1) = 0` (even)
  - Expected output: Bob
  - Actual output: Bob
- **Example 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
  - `abs(1 - 4) = 3` (odd)
  - Expected output: Alice
  - Actual output: Alice
- **Example 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
  - `abs(5 - 3) = 2` (even)
  - Expected output: Bob
  - Actual output: Bob
- **Example 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - `abs(4 - 5) = 1` (odd)
  - Expected output: Alice
  - Actual output: Alice

All examples match the expected outcomes, confirming that the logic is correct.

### Additional Considerations:
- The solution correctly handles the edge cases where the number of coins is very large (up to \(10^9\)).
- The solution efficiently processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The logic and implementation are sound and produce the correct results for all given examples.

Final: **True**
