Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` is an integer provided by the user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` and `b` are specific integers provided by the user input (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), and `i` is `t-1`. The loop has printed "Bob" for each pair of `a` and `b` where the absolute difference between them is even, and "Alice" for each pair where the absolute difference is odd.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains the same as it was initially provided by the user input.
- The variables `a` and `b` are updated with new values from the user input during each iteration of the loop.
- The loop index `i` will be `t-1` after the last iteration, since the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd, and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.
