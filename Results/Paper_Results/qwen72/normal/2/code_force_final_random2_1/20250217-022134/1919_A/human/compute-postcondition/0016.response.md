Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer provided by the user input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a` and `b` are specific integers provided by the user input, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- `i` is 2.
- The condition checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is even, the condition is true; if it is odd, the condition is false.

However, the provided code snippet does not include any conditional logic. It simply prints the string 'Alice'. Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`, the code will always print 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
