Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer provided by the user input, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, with the constraint \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- `i` is 1.
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- The condition checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is even, the condition is true; if it is odd, the condition is false.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Alice**
