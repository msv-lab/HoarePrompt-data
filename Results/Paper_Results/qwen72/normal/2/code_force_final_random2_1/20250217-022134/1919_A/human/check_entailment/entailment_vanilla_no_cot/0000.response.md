Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The logic hinges on the fact that the game's outcome is determined by the initial conditions and the optimal play strategy, which leads to a simple check of whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the difference is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins. This aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.
