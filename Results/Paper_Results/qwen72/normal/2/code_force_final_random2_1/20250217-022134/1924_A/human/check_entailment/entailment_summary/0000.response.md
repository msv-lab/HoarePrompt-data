Reasoning:

1. **Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process the string `s` and determine if it contains all possible subsequences of length `n` formed from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It maintains a set `alphabet` of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and iterates through the string `s`.
   - For each character in `s` that is in the `alphabet` set:
     - If the set has more than one element, the character is removed from the set.
     - If the set has exactly one element, the character is added to `s2` and the set is reset to the original `k` alphabets.
   - The function returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from the position `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2` which contains characters added when the set had exactly one element left.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to get the result.
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, it means not all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. It then constructs a missing subsequence and appends it to the output list `OUT`.
   - If the boolean is `True`, it appends "Yes" to the output list `OUT`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results stored in `OUT`.

4. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the logic of checking for subsequences and constructing a missing subsequence if needed.
   - The main logic correctly processes the input and outputs the results as required.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality and handle the specified edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
