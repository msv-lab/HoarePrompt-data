### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function Call and Output Collection:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `s`, `k`, and `n`.
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, the program appends "Yes" or "No" to the output list `OUT`.
   - If the result is "No", it constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` and appends it to `OUT`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `s1` and `s2` are initialized as empty strings.
     - `alphabet` is initialized as a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - **Loop Through String `s`:**
     - For each character `i` in `s`, if `i` is in `alphabet`:
       - If `alphabet` has more than one element, `i` is removed from `alphabet` and added to `s1`.
       - If `alphabet` has exactly one element, `i` is added to `s2`, and `alphabet` is reset to the original set of `k` alphabets.
   - **Final Checks and Return:**
     - The function calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
     - It returns a tuple containing:
       - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
       - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
       - The string `s2`.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - The program prints the results stored in `OUT`.

### Issues and Correctness:

- **Boolean Condition in `func_1`:**
  - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` is used to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` alphabets.
  - This condition is correct because if `s1` has at least `n * k` characters, it means that there are enough unique characters to form all possible combinations of length `n`.

- **Construction of Non-Subsequence String:**
  - The program attempts to construct a string that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` by finding the first character not in `s1` and repeating it `n` times.
  - This approach is correct because if a character is not in `s1`, it means that it does not appear enough times to form a subsequence of length `n`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or `n` is 1 correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` alphabets and to generate a non-subsequence string if necessary.

**Correctness: **True****
