The code `alphabet.remove(i)` removes the second character of the string `s` from the set `alphabet`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty.
   - `i` is the second character of `s`.
   - `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`.
   - If the size of `alphabet` is greater than 1, `s2` remains an empty string.
   - If the size of `alphabet` is exactly 1, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`.
   - `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets except for the first character of `s`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The second character of `s` (denoted as `i`) is removed from the set `alphabet`.

3. **Resulting State:**
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains the second character of `s`.
   - `s1` remains a string containing the first character of `s`.
   - `s2` remains unchanged (either an empty string or a string containing the first character of `s` depending on the size of `alphabet`).
   - `alphabet` now contains the first k lowercase English alphabets except for the first character of `s` and the second character of `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty, `i` is the second character of `s`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, if the size of `alphabet` is greater than 1, `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets except for the first character of `s` and the second character of `s`. If the size of `alphabet` is exactly 1, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `alphabet` remains a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets except for the first character of `s` and the second character of `s`.**
