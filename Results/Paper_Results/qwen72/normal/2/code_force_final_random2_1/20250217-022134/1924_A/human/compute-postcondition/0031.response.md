The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `s`, `k`, and `n`. 

- `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26).

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
2. A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
3. A string `s2` containing all characters from `s` that were added when the alphabet had exactly one element left.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It returns a tuple with a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and a string `s2` containing characters from `s` that were added when the alphabet had exactly one element left.**
