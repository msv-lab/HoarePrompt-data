Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**: The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`. It only checks if the length of the constructed string `s1` is at least `n * k`, which is not sufficient to ensure that all possible combinations are subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence**: The logic for constructing a missing subsequence when the answer is "NO" is flawed. The code attempts to find a character that is not in `s1` and repeats it to form the missing subsequence. This approach does not guarantee that the constructed string is indeed a missing subsequence.

3. **Handling of Alphabet Set**: The way the `alphabet` set is used and modified within the loop is incorrect. The set is reset to the full set of `k` characters whenever a character is repeated, which does not help in checking all possible subsequences.

4. **Output Format**: The output format should be consistent with the problem statement. The program should print "YES" or "NO" followed by the missing subsequence if the answer is "NO". The current implementation prints "No" instead of "NO".

To fix these issues, a more robust approach is needed to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if they are subsequences of `s`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase English alphabets
    all_possible = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    # Check if all possible strings are subsequences of s
    for possible in all_possible:
        if not is_subsequence(possible, s):
            print("NO")
            print(possible)
            break
    else:
        print("YES")
```

This corrected version generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checks if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" followed by the missing subsequence. If all possible strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".
