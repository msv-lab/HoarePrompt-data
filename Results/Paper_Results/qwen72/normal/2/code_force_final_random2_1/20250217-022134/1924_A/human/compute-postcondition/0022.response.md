Output State: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty. `i` is the third character of `s`. `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`. `i` has been removed from the set `alphabet`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty.
- `i` is the third character of `s`.
- `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`.
- The code `alphabet.remove(i)` removes the character `i` from the set `alphabet`.
- The values of `s` and `s1` remain unchanged.
- The set `alphabet` now no longer contains the character `i`.
