Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer input by the user, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is an integer input by the user.
- `j` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' because at least one of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1' character.
- `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1' character, otherwise `b` remains an empty string.

Given the `print(a)` statement, we need to determine the value of `a`.

From the initial state, it is explicitly stated that `a` is 'TRIANGLE' because at least one of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1' character. Therefore, the value of `a` is 'TRIANGLE'.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
