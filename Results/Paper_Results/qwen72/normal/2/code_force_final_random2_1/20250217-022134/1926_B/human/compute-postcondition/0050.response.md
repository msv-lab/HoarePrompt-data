Postcondition: ***`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` remains 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is 1; if `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1' character, `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If `s` does not contain any '1' characters, `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string. `s` is now the new string input by the user.***
