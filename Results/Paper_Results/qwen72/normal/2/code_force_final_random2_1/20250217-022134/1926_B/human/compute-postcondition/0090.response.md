Postcondition: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` is the new integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' because the input string `s` contained exactly one '1'; `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.**
