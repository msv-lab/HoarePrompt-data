Output State: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2; `j` is 2; `s` is a new string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.**
