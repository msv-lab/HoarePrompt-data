Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case. It also reads the grid itself line by line.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row `s` in the grid, it checks the count of '1's in the row.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - After processing all rows, it checks if `a` is not zero (which means a triangle was detected). If so, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

4. **Issues**:
   - The logic for detecting shapes is flawed. The current implementation will incorrectly identify any grid with a row containing exactly one '1' as a triangle, regardless of the overall shape.
   - Similarly, it will identify any grid with a row containing more than one '1' as a square, even if the overall shape is a triangle.
   - This approach does not consider the structure of the entire grid, which is necessary to correctly identify the shape.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify the shape, the function should check the entire grid to ensure that the pattern of '1's matches the definition of a triangle or a square.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern \(2i - 1\) for some \(i\), and the central '1's should be aligned in one column.
   - For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same and form a continuous block.

Given the issues in the current implementation, the program is indeed incorrect. The function does not properly account for the structure of the entire grid and can produce incorrect results based on the partial information from individual rows.

Final: **False**
