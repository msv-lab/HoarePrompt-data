Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly identify the shapes as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangle and Square Identification**:
   - The code checks if a row has exactly one '1' (`if s.count('1') == 1:`) and immediately sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. This is incorrect because a single '1' in a row does not necessarily mean the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row.
   - Similarly, the code checks if a row has more than one '1' (`elif s.count('1') > 1:`) and immediately sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This is also incorrect because a row with multiple '1's could be part of a triangle or a square.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Shape**:
   - The logic for determining whether the shape is a triangle or a square should involve checking the pattern of '1's across multiple rows, not just the count of '1's in a single row.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should form a specific pattern (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...).
   - For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same and form a block of '1's.

3. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The code does not reset the variables `a` and `b` between test cases, which can lead to incorrect results if the previous test case influenced these variables.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm that checks the pattern of '1's across all rows to determine if the shape is a triangle or a square.
