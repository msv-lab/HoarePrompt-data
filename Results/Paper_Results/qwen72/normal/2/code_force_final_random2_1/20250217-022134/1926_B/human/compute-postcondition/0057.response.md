Output State: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` remains 1; `n` is the integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1' character, otherwise `a` remains 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1' character, otherwise `b` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `n` is the integer input by the user, which determines the number of iterations.
- `j` is `n-1` after the loop completes, as it is the final value of the loop counter.
- `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop's execution.
- `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1' character during the loop's execution. If no such strings were entered, `b` remains an empty string.
