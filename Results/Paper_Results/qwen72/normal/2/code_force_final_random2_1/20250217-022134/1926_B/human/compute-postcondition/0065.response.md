Output State: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` is the new integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`; `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1' character, otherwise `b` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is set to 0, overriding any previous value it might have had.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `b`) retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
