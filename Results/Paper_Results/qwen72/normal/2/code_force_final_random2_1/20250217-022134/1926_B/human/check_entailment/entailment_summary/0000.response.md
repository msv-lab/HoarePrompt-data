Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking the number of '1's in each row of the grid. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the shapes as defined in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Triangle Identification**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1'. This is insufficient because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially as the triangle grows larger. For example, a triangle with `k=3` will have rows with 1, 3, and 5 '1's respectively. The program would incorrectly identify such a triangle as a square if any row has more than one '1'.

2. **Square Identification**: The program assumes that if any row contains more than one '1', the shape must be a square. This is also incorrect because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, and the program does not check the specific pattern required for a square (i.e., `k` consecutive '1's in each of `k` rows).

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the grid is entirely filled with '0's or when the shape is an upside-down triangle.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly identify the shapes as per the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
