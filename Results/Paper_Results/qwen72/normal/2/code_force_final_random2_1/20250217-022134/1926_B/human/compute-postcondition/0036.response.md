To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer input by the user
- `j` is `n-1`
- `a` is 0
- `b` is an empty string

For Loop:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop `for j in range(n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. This is because `range(n)` generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`, and this sequence is non-empty only if `n > 0`.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `j` is initialized by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust its value explicitly.

4. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is initialized by the loop.
   - `a` remains 0.
   - `b` remains an empty string.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string**
