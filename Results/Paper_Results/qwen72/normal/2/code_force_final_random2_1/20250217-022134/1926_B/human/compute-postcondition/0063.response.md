The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition is based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will now be 2. For the loop to continue executing, `t` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` is the integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If any of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1' character, otherwise `b` remains an empty string.**
