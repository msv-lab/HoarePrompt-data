Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `s` is a new string input by the user; `a` is 0; `j` is 1. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.***
