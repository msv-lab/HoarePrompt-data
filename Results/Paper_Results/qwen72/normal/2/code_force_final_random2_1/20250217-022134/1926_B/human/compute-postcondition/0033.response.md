Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `n` is an integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`; `a` is 0; `b` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer input by the user.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 100, which remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The variable `j` is calculated as `n-1` based on the new value of `n`.
- The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states, with `a` being 0 and `b` being an empty string.
