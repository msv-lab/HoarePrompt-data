Output State: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` is the new integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If any of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1' character, otherwise `b` remains an empty string.**
