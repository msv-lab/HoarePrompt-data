The code snippet `b = ''` reassigns the variable `b` to an empty string, overriding its previous value. This means that regardless of the initial condition of `b` (which was 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1' character, otherwise an empty string), `b` is now explicitly set to an empty string.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` is the new integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`; `a` is 0; `b` is an empty string.**
