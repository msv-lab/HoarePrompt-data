Output State: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` is the new integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any input string `s` contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` remains 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `j` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, as it iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- `a` will be set to 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1'. If none of the strings contained exactly one '1', `a` remains 0.
- `b` will be set to 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1'. If none of the strings contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.
