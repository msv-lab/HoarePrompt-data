Postcondition: ***`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` remains 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1' character, otherwise `a` remains 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `b` remains an empty string; `s` is now the new string input by the user.***
