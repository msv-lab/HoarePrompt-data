Postcondition: ***`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` remains 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `j` is initialized by the loop; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1' character, otherwise `a` remains 0; `b` remains an empty string if the count of '1' in `s` is not greater than 1, otherwise `b` is set to 'SQUARE'; `s` is a string input by the user.***
