Output State: **`i` is `bets + 1`, `a[bets]` is `prod // a[bets]`**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `i` is currently `bets`, and incrementing `i` by 1 makes `i` equal to `bets + 1`.
- The code `a[i] = prod // a[i]` updates the element at index `i` in the list `a` to be the integer division of `prod` by `a[i]`.
- Since `i` is now `bets + 1`, the element at index `bets` in the list `a` is updated to `prod // a[bets]`.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
