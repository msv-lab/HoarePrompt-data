The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `bets` (number of outcomes) and a list of integers `a` (multipliers). It calculates the product of all elements in `a` and then updates each element to the product divided by itself. It sums the updated elements and compares this sum to the original product. If the sum is greater than or equal to the product, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the updated list of elements as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the processed results for each test case.
