Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 1, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers where `a[bets - 1]` is `prod // a[bets - 1]` and `a[bets]` is `prod // a[bets]`, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` before the update, `i` is `bets`, `sumo` is `sumo + a[bets - 1] + a[bets]`, and if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the previous updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`.**
