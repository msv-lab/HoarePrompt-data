Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of outcomes. k_1, k_2, ..., k_n are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = 1
    for i in range(bets):
        prod *= a[i]
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is the number of iterations, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the product of all original elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` remains at least 1, `T` remains 1, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers where each element from index 0 to `bets - 1` has been updated to `prod // a[i]` (where `prod` is the product of the original elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`), `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no additional changes are made. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` remains at least 1, `T` is 2, `bets` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[i]`. Otherwise, the elements in `a` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
