The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `bets` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `bets` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + a[1]`, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`.**
