Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 1, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the product of all original elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`.**
