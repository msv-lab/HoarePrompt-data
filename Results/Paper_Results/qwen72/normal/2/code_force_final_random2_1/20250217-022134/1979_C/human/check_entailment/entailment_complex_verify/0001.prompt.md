You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

    #State: `t` is 0, `T` is `t - 1`, `bets` is the number of iterations for the last test case, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` for the last test case, `prod` is the product of all original elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` for the last test case, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` for the last test case. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` for any test case, the output for that test case is `-1`. Otherwise, the output for each test case is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `bets` (number of outcomes) and a list of integers `a` (multipliers). It calculates the product of all elements in `a` and then updates each element to the product divided by itself. It sums the updated elements and compares this sum to the original product. If the sum is greater than or equal to the product, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the updated list of elements as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the processed results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet should be less than the minimum of `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then sets each bet `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]` and sums up all the bets to get `sumo`.
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Product Calculation:** The product of all multipliers `prod` is calculated correctly.
   - **Bet Calculation:** Each bet `a[i]` is set to `prod // a[i]`. This ensures that the total amount bet is `sumo = sum(prod // a[i] for i in range(bets))`.
   - **Condition Check:** The condition `sumo < prod` is checked to ensure the total amount bet is strictly less than the product of all multipliers.
   - **Output:** If the condition is met, the bets are printed. Otherwise, `-1` is printed.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The condition `sumo < prod` is not necessarily the correct condition to check. The correct condition should be that the total amount bet `sumo` should be strictly less than the minimum of `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - The current implementation assumes that `prod` is the correct threshold, but this is not always true. For example, if all `k_i` are the same, the total bet `sumo` will be `n * (prod // k_i)`, which may not satisfy the condition.

5. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition should be that the total amount bet `sumo` should be strictly less than the minimum of `k_i * x_i` for all `i`. This means `sumo < min(k_i * (prod // k_i))` for all `i`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the required condition to ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
