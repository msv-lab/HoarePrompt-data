Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a fundamental flaw in its logic for determining the bets. The approach taken is to calculate the product of all multipliers and then divide this product by each individual multiplier to determine the bets. This method does not ensure that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return from any winning outcome, which is a requirement of the problem.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following:

1. **Product Calculation**: The product of all multipliers (`prod`) grows very quickly, especially when `n` is large. This can lead to overflow issues, but more importantly, it does not help in finding a valid distribution of bets.

2. **Sum of Bets**: The sum of the bets (`sumo`) is calculated by dividing the product by each multiplier. However, this sum is not guaranteed to be less than the product itself, which is what the code checks with `if sumo >= prod:`. This check is incorrect because the condition we need to satisfy is that the sum of bets should be less than the return from any winning outcome, not the product of all multipliers.

3. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve finding a set of bets such that the sum of the bets is less than the minimum return from any winning outcome. One way to achieve this is to use a common divisor or a smaller value that ensures the sum of bets is less than the return from any winning outcome.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize bets to 1 for each outcome
        bets = [1] * n
        
        # Calculate the total sum of bets
        total_bets = sum(bets)
        
        # Check if the total sum of bets is less than the return from any winning outcome
        if all(total_bets < k[i] * bets[i] for i in range(n)):
            print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This version initializes all bets to 1 and checks if the total sum of bets is less than the return from any winning outcome. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`. This approach is simpler and more likely to meet the problem's requirements.
