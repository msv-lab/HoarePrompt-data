The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the context provided, it seems to operate within a predefined environment where `start` and `end` are integers representing the range of folder names to be processed. The function processes subfolders within the current directory, which may contain `.html` files.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **Processes a range of subfolders (from `start` to `end`) within the current directory, where each subfolder may contain `.html` files. The function does not return any value but performs operations on the specified subfolders.**
