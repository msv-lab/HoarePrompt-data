Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. Additionally, `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2 or `cnt1` is even. If `s` contains the substring '11', the program processes the folders within the specified range and checks for .html files. If `s` does not contain the substring '11', the program still processes the folders within the specified range and checks for .html files.**
