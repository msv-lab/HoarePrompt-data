Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or even, the program processes the folders within the specified range and checks for .html files, regardless of whether `s` contains the substring '11'.**
