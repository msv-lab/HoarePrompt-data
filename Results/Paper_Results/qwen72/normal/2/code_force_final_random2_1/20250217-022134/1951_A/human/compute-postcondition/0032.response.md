The code snippet `cnt1 = s.count('1')` calculates the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `cnt1`.

Given the initial state:
- `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`.
- The current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files.
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.

After executing the code snippet, the only change is that `cnt1` is now specifically the count of '1's in the string `s`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.**
