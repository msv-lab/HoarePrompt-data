Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start and end are integers where start <= end, representing the range of folder names to be processed. The current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or even, the program processes the folders within the specified range and checks for .html files, regardless of whether `s` contains the substring '11'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` % 2 == 0, the state remains unchanged. If `cnt1` > 2 and (`cnt1` % 2 == 1 or `cnt1` == 1), the state remains unchanged. If '11' is in `s`, the state remains unchanged. In all other cases, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the state remains unchanged. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and either odd or 1, the state remains unchanged. If `cnt1` is not greater than 2 or `cnt1` is even and not 1, and if '11' is in `s`, the state remains unchanged. If '11' is not in `s`, the state also remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
