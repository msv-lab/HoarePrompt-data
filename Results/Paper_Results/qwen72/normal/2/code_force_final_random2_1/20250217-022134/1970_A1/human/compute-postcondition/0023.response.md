To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
   - `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, meaning every opening parenthesis "(" has a corresponding closing parenthesis ")".
   - The length of `s` does not exceed 500,000.
   - `balance` is 0 because the sequence is balanced.
   - `details` is a sorted list of tuples, each in the form `(balance, -i, char)`, where:
     - `balance` is the balance of the parentheses at position `i`.
     - `-i` is the negative index of the character in the string `s`.
     - `char` is the character at position `i` in the string `s`.
   - `i` is the last index of the string `s`, i.e., `len(s) - 1`.
   - `result` is a string that contains the characters from `details` in the order they appear in the sorted list.

2. **Understanding the Sorting**:
   - The list `details` is sorted primarily by `balance`, then by `-i`, and finally by `char`.
   - Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the `balance` will always be 0 at the end of the sequence.
   - The sorting by `-i` means that the characters will be ordered by their positions in the string `s` in reverse order (from the last to the first).
   - The sorting by `char` is not significant here because the characters are only "(" and ")".

3. **Constructing `result`**:
   - The `details` list will contain tuples where the `balance` is 0, and the characters are sorted by their positions in reverse order.
   - Therefore, `result` will be a string that contains the characters of `s` in reverse order.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `s` in reverse order.

Output: **s reversed (where s is the original balanced parentheses sequence)**
