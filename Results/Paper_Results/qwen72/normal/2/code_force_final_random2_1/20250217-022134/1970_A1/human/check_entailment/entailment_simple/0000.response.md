Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is read into the variable `s`, which is assumed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The program iterates through the string `s` and calculates the balance at each position. If the character is '(', the balance is incremented; if the character is ')', the balance is decremented. This part is correct and ensures that the balance is calculated correctly.

3. **Details Collection**: For each character in the string, a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` is appended to the `details` list. The use of `-i` ensures that when sorting, ties in balance are broken in decreasing order of position, as required by the problem.

4. **Sorting**: The `details` list is sorted based on the balance and then by the negative index. This step correctly rearranges the characters according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

5. **Result Construction**: The sorted `details` list is used to construct the result string by extracting the characters from the tuples. The result is then printed.

6. **Output**: The output is the balanced shuffle of the input string, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above steps, the program correctly performs the balanced shuffle operation and produces the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
