Output State: **`s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `balance` is 0 because the sequence is balanced. `details` is now a sorted list of tuples, each in the form `(balance, -i, char)`, sorted primarily by `balance`, then by `-i`, and finally by `char`. `i` is the last index of the string `s` (i.e., `len(s) - 1`). `result` is a string that contains the characters from `details` in the order they appear in the sorted list.**

Explanation:
- The code `result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)` constructs a new string `result` by joining the characters from the third element of each tuple in the `details` list.
- Since `details` is already sorted by `balance`, `-i`, and `char`, the characters in `result` will follow the same order as they appear in the sorted `details`.
- The values of `s`, `balance`, `details`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `result` is created and holds the concatenated string of characters from the `details` list.
