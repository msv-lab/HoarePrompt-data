The `details.sort()` command sorts the list `details` based on the tuples it contains. Each tuple in `details` is in the form `(balance, -i, char)`, and the sorting is done primarily by the `balance` value, secondarily by the `-i` value (which represents the negative index of the character), and finally by the `char` itself.

Given that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the `balance` value will fluctuate between positive and zero values as the parentheses open and close, but ultimately, the sequence is balanced, meaning the final `balance` is 0. The `-i` values ensure that characters are sorted in reverse order of their positions in the string `s`.

After sorting, the `details` list will be ordered such that tuples with lower `balance` values come first, and within the same `balance` value, tuples with higher indices (lower `-i` values) come first. The `char` values will be sorted last, but since there are only two possible characters `(` and `)`, this will not affect the primary sorting criteria.

Output State: **`s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `balance` is 0 because the sequence is balanced. `details` is now a sorted list of tuples, each in the form `(balance, -i, char)`, sorted primarily by `balance`, then by `-i`, and finally by `char`. `i` is the last index of the string `s` (i.e., `len(s) - 1`).**
