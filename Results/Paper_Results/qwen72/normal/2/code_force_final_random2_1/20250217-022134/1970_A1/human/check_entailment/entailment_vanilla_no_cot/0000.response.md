Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program iterates through the input string `s`, updating the balance for each character. If the character is '(', the balance increases by 1; if it is ')', the balance decreases by 1. This correctly computes the balance of each prefix.

2. **Details Collection**: For each character in the input string, the program collects a tuple containing the balance, the negative index (to break ties in decreasing order of position), and the character itself. This ensures that when sorting, the characters are ordered by their balance and then by their position in reverse order.

3. **Sorting**: The list of tuples `details` is sorted based on the balance and the negative index. This sorting step correctly rearranges the characters according to the rules specified in the problem.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list. This results in the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the result string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given that the program follows the steps outlined in the problem description and produces the correct output for the given example, the program is correct.
