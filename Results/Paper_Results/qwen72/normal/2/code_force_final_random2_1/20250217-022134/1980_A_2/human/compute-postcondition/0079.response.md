The value of `ans` is incremented by the difference between `m` and `hmp[i]`. Since `i` is 'F', the value of `hmp['F']` is subtracted from `m`, and the result is added to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is 'ABCDEF', `i` is 'F', `hmp` must have at least one key, and the value of `hmp['F']` is less than `m`; `ans` is increased by `m - hmp['F']`.**
