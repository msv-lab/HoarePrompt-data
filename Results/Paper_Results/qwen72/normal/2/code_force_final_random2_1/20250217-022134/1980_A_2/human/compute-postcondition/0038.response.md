Postcondition: **`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are now the integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'A', `ans` is 0, `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user, and the character 'A' is not present in the Counter object `hmp`.**
