Output State: **`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and must have at least three key-value pairs, `i` is the third key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp` plus `(m - hmp[i])` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.**
