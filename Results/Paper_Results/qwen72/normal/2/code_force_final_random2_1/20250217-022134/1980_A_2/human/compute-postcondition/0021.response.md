Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are now the integers provided by the user input, `s` is a non-empty string input by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is a key in `hmp`, `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `m` and the current value of `hmp[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
