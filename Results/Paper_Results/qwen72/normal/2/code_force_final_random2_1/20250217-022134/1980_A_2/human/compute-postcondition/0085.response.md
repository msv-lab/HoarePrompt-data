The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` updates the value of `ans` based on the value of `hmp[i]` and `m`. According to the initial state, if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, `ans` remains unchanged.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**: `p` is 'ABCDEF', `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current `i`, `hmp` has at least one key remaining. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The value of `hmp[i]` is checked.
   - If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value.
   - If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Output State**:
   - If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.
   - If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, `ans` remains unchanged.
   - The values of `p`, `i`, and `hmp` remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`p` is 'ABCDEF', `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current `i`, `hmp` has at least one key remaining. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
