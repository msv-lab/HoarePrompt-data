Output State: **`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is an integer input by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is an integer input by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is the last key in `hmp` that was processed by the loop, `ans` is 0, `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `hmp = Counter(s)` updates the `hmp` variable to be a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user, and the Counter object `hmp` now reflects the character counts in this new string `s`.
