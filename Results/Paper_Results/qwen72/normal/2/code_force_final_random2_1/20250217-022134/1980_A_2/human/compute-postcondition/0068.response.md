The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans` or `m`. Therefore, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`p` is 'ABCDEF', `i` is 'A', `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m`.**
