Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` contain the values of `a` appended based on the corresponding values of `x` (1, 2, or any other value) for each iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `loop`, `iterable`, `num`:** These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`innerLoop`:** This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will run. It remains the same throughout the loop.
- **`iterable2`:** This variable increments with each iteration of the loop, starting from 0 and ending at `innerLoop - 1`.
- **`x` and `a`:** These variables are input integers read during each iteration of the loop. After the loop completes, `x` and `a` will hold the values of the last input pair.
- **`big`, `less`, `no`:** These lists are populated based on the value of `x` during each iteration:
  - If `x` is 1, `a` is appended to `big`.
  - If `x` is 2, `a` is appended to `less`.
  - For any other value of `x`, `a` is appended to `no`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain the values of `a` that were appended based on the corresponding values of `x` for each iteration.
