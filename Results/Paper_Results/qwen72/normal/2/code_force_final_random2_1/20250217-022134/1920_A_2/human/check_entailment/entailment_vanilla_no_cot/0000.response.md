Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It processes the input to gather constraints, calculates the range of valid `k` values, and adjusts for any specific exclusions (`k` must not equal some value). The solution accounts for all specified constraints and outputs the correct number of valid `k` values for each test case.
