Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is the first integer read from input, `a` is the second integer read from input, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `i` is undefined, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` twice if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is a list containing the value of `a` once if `x` is 2 and remains unchanged otherwise, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` twice if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is a list containing the value of `a` once if `x` is 1 and remains an empty list otherwise.***
