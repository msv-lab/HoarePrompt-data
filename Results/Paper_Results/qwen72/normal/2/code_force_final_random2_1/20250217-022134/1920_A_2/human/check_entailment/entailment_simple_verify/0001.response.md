### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Loop Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).

2. **Constraint Collection:**
   - The function initializes three lists: `less`, `big`, and `no` to store the constraints of types 2, 1, and 3, respectively.
   - It correctly appends the values to these lists based on the type of constraint.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the minimum value from the `less` list and the maximum value from the `big` list.
   - It computes the potential range of valid `k` values as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

4. **Handling Invalid Ranges:**
   - If the calculated range is less than 1, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This handles cases where the constraints are contradictory (e.g., `k >= 5` and `k <= 4`).

5. **Excluding Specific Values:**
   - The function iterates through the `no` list to exclude any values that fall within the valid range.
   - It decrements the count of valid `k` values for each such value found.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Range Calculation:**
  - The calculation `min(less) - max(big) + 1` correctly determines the range of valid `k` values. This is because `min(less)` gives the smallest upper bound and `max(big)` gives the largest lower bound. Adding 1 accounts for the inclusive nature of the range.

- **Handling of Contradictory Constraints:**
  - The check `if num < 1:` ensures that if the range is invalid (i.e., no valid `k` values exist), the function prints 0 and moves to the next test case. This is correct and necessary.

- **Exclusion of Specific Values:**
  - The loop `for i in no:` correctly excludes values that are explicitly forbidden by the constraints of type 3. The condition `if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):` ensures that only values within the valid range are considered for exclusion.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases where the constraints are tight (e.g., `k >= 5` and `k <= 5` with no excluded values) correctly, printing 1.
  - It also handles cases where the constraints are contradictory (e.g., `k >= 5` and `k <= 4`) correctly, printing 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
