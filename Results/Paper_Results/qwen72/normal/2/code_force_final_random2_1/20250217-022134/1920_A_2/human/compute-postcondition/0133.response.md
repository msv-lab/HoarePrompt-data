Postcondition: **`i` is undefined, `no` contains all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `iterable` is `k + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `k + 1`, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is the number of iterations executed, `x` and `a` are integers provided by user input during each iteration, and the current value of `num` is less than 1.**
