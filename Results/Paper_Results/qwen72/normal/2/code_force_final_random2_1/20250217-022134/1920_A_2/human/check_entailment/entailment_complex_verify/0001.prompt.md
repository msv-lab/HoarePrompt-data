You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` is the total number of iterations the loop was set to run, `iterable` is `loop - 1`, `num` is the final calculated value of `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the number of elements in `no` that satisfy `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, `innerLoop` is the input integer for the last iteration, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is a list of integers where `x` was 3, `less` is a list of integers where `x` was 2, `big` is a list of integers where `x` was 1. If `num` is less than 1, the value of `num` printed is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function categorizes these constraints into three lists: `big` for type 1, `less` for type 2, and `no` for type 3. It calculates the number of valid solutions as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, adjusting this count by subtracting the number of elements in `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. If the calculated number of solutions is less than 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the calculated number. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value, leaving the input variables `t` and `n` unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Loop Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).

2. **Constraint Collection:**
   - The function initializes three lists: `less`, `big`, and `no` to store the constraints of types 2, 1, and 3, respectively.
   - It correctly appends the values to these lists based on the type of constraint.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the minimum value from the `less` list and the maximum value from the `big` list.
   - It computes the potential range of valid `k` values as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

4. **Handling Invalid Ranges:**
   - If the calculated range is less than 1, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This handles cases where the constraints are contradictory (e.g., `k >= 5` and `k <= 4`).

5. **Excluding Specific Values:**
   - The function iterates through the `no` list to exclude any values that fall within the valid range.
   - It decrements the count of valid `k` values for each such value found.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
