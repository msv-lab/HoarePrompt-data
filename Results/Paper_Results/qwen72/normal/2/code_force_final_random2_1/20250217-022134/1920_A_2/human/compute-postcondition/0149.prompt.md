Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution set. No two constraints are the same within a test case. `loop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is a non-empty list, `i` is the last element of `no`. Here, `count` is the number of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the last element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2. For each element `i` in `no`, if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1 for each such element. The final value of `num` is the initial value of `num` minus the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the last element in `no`, `no` must contain at least one integer, `iterable` is `k + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `k + 1`, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the number of elements in `no` that satisfy `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, `innerLoop` is the number of iterations executed, `x` and `a` are integers provided by user input during each iteration. If `num` is less than 1, the current value of `num` remains less than 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
