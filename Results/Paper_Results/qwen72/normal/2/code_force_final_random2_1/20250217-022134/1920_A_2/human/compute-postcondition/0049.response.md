Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is a non-empty list, `i` is the last element of `no`. Here, `count` is the number of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `no`.
- For each element `i`, if `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, `num` is decremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `num` will be `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`, where `count` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
