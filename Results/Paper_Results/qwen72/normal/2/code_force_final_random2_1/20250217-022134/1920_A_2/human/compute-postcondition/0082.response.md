Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `i` is undefined, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `loop`, `iterable`, `num`:** These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`innerLoop`:** This variable is the total number of iterations the loop will run.
- **`iterable2`:** After the loop completes, `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1` because the loop runs from 0 to `innerLoop - 1`.
- **`x` and `a`:** These variables will hold the values of the last input read during the final iteration of the loop.
- **`no`:** This list will contain all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2.
- **`less`:** This list will contain all values of `a` where `x` is 2.
- **`big`:** This list will contain all values of `a` where `x` is 1.
- **`i`:** This variable remains undefined as it is not used or modified in the loop.
