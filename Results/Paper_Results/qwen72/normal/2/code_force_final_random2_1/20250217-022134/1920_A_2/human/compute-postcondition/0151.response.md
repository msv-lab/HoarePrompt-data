Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function categorizes these constraints into three lists: `big` for type 1, `less` for type 2, and `no` for type 3. It calculates the number of valid solutions as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, adjusting this count by subtracting the number of elements in `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. If the calculated number of solutions is less than 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the calculated number. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value, leaving the input variables `t` and `n` unchanged. **
