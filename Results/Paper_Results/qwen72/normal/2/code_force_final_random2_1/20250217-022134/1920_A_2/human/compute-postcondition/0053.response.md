Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is a non-empty list, `i` is the last element of `no`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `big` as an empty list. This does not affect any other variables, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `num` is now dependent on the maximum value of an empty list (`big`), which will be `None` or undefined, but since the initial state already specifies `num` as `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`, and `less` is an empty list, `min(less)` is also undefined. Therefore, the expression for `num` remains as `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
