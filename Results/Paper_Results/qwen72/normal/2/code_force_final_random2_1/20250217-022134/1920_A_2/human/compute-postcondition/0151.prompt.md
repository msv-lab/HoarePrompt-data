You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution set. No two constraints are the same within a test case.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` is the total number of iterations the loop was set to run, `iterable` is `loop - 1`, `num` is the final calculated value of `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the number of elements in `no` that satisfy `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, `innerLoop` is the input integer for the last iteration, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is a list of integers where `x` was 3, `less` is a list of integers where `x` was 2, `big` is a list of integers where `x` was 1. If `num` is less than 1, the value of `num` printed is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). Each test case must include at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, ensuring a finite solution set. No two constraints are the same within a test case. The function returns a result based on the processing of these constraints for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
