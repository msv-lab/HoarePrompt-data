The code snippet `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` is defined as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. After decrementing `num` by 1, the new value of `num` becomes `min(less) - max(big)`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element of `no`, and `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive.**
