Output State: **`i` is undefined, `no` is an empty list, `iterable` is `k + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `k + 1`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `no = []` reassigns `no` to an empty list, overriding its previous value.
- Since `i` was initially the last element of `no`, and `no` is now an empty list, `i` is no longer defined.
- The other variables (`iterable`, `loop`, `less`, `big`) remain unchanged.
