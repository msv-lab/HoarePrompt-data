The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables within this specific iteration, and the loop continues with the next iteration.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`i` is undefined, `no` contains all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `iterable` is `k + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `k + 1`, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is the number of iterations executed, `x` and `a` are integers provided by user input during each iteration, and the current value of `num` is less than 1.**
