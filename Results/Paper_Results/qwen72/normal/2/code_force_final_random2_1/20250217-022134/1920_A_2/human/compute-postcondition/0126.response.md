The code `big.append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `big`. Based on the initial state, the lists `no` and `less` remain unchanged, while `big` now contains the integer `a` regardless of the value of `x`.

Output State: **`i` is undefined, `iterable` is `k + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `k + 1`, `iterable2` is `k + 3`, `innerLoop` must be greater than `k + 3`, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer provided by user input, `a` is an integer provided by user input, `no` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `big` contains the integer `a`.**
