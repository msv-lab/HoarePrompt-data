To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

### Given Loop:
```python
for j in pl:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
- `w` is greater than 1
- `_` is 1
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers from the input
- `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` and must have at least 2 elements
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `palka`
- `j` is the second element in `pl`
- If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is set to 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is set to 1

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the list `pl`.
- The variable `j` is the current element being processed in the loop.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to the next element in `pl`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `pl`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second element in `pl`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to the third element in `pl`.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
- `w` remains greater than 1
- `_` remains 1
- `ln` remains an input integer
- `palka` remains a list of integers from the input
- `pl` remains a list containing all unique elements from `palka` and must have at least 2 elements
- `d` remains a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `palka`
- `j` is now the third element in `pl`
- If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is set to 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is set to 1

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `palka`, `j` is the third element in `pl`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is set to 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is set to 1**
