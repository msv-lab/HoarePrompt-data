Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr`, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 4. After the function concludes, the original list `arr` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the total number of groups of 4 sticks that can be formed from each unique stick length. **
