The value of `shapes` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `j` is the third element in `pl`, `shapes` is incremented by 1.**
