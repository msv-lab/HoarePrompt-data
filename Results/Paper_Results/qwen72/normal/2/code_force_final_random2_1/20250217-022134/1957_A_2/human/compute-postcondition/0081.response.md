Let's break down the initial state and determine the value of `shapes`:

1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
   - `w`: Greater than 1.
   - `_`: Equals 1.
   - `ln`: An input integer.
   - `palka`: A list of integers from the input.
   - `pl`: A list containing all unique elements from `palka`.
   - `d`: A dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `palka`.
   - `shapes`: The total number of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times.

2. **Determine the Value of `shapes`:**
   - `palka` is a list of integers.
   - `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of that element in `palka`.
   - `shapes` is the count of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times.

3. **Steps to Calculate `shapes`:**
   - Create the dictionary `d` by counting the occurrences of each element in `palka`.
   - Iterate through the dictionary `d` and count how many keys have a value of 3 or more.

Given this information, the `print(shapes)` statement will output the number of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the total number of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times)**
