To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in pl:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

In this loop, the only object in the loop head is `j`, which will take on the values from the list `pl`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `pl` is not empty. If `pl` is empty, the loop will not run at all.
3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `pl` is not empty for the loop to execute.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
- `w` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has been fully iterated over
- `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`
- `shapes` is 0

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, `pl` must contain at least one element. Therefore, `palka` must contain at least one unique integer.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has been fully iterated over, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 1 unique integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `shapes` is 0**
