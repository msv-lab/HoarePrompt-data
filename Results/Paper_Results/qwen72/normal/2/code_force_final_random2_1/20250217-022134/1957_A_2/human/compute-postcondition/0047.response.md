The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `palka`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If `palka` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `i` should be the first element of `palka`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `i` is the first element of `palka`**
