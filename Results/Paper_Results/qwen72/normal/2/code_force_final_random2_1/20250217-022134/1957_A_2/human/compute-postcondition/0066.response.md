Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list that may contain the first, second, and third elements of `palka` if they were not already present, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the third element of `palka`) is either set to 1 (if it did not exist in `d` before) or incremented by 1, `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` now contains the third element of `palka` appended to it.**
