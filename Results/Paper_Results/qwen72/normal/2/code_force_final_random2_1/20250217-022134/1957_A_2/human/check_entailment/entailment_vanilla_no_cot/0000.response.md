Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be formed from the sticks. However, the problem asks for the maximum number of regular polygons, which can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. The current implementation only considers 4-sided polygons, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should consider all possible regular polygons (from triangles upwards) and calculate the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed. This would involve finding the maximum value of `v // k` for each possible number of sides `k` (where `k >= 3`), and then summing these values.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    
    max_polygons = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        for sides in range(3, count + 1):  # Consider polygons with 3 or more sides
            max_polygons += count // sides
            count %= sides  # Update the remaining sticks after forming the polygons
    
    return max_polygons
```

This function correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks.
