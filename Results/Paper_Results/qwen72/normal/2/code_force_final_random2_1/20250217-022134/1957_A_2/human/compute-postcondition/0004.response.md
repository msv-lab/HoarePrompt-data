The code updates the `freq` dictionary by incrementing the count of the value `n` (which is the second element in `arr`). If `n` is already a key in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1. If `n` is not a key in `freq`, it is added with a value of 1.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `n` is the second element in `arr`.
- `freq` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its value is 1.

After executing the code:
- The value of `n` remains the second element in `arr`.
- The `freq` dictionary now includes the key `n` with a value of 1 if `n` was not previously in `freq`, or the value of `n` is incremented by 1 if `n` was already in `freq`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the second element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its value is 1, and `n` as a key with a value of 1 if `n` was not previously in `freq`, or the value of `n` is incremented by 1 if `n` was already in `freq`.**
