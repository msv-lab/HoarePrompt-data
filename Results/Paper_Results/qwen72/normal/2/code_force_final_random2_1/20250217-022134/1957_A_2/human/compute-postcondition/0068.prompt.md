Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka` if it was not already present, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the first element of `palka`) is either set to 1 (if it did not exist in `d` before) or incremented by 1, `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, and `i` is the first element of `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl`, it is now added to `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka` if it was not already present, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the second element of `palka`) is either set to 1 (if it did not exist in `d` before) or incremented by 1, `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `i` is the second element of `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl`, it is now added to `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list that may contain the first, second, and third elements of `palka` if they were not already present, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the third element of `palka`) is either set to 1 (if it did not exist in `d` before) or incremented by 1, `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `i` is the third element of `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` now contains the third element of `palka` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
