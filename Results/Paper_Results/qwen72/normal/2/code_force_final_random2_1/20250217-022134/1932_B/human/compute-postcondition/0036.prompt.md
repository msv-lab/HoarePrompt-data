You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string. The length of path is at least 1.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: path is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string. The length of path is at least 1. `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 0.

The length of `path` is at least 1. `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 0. `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`. The first element of `path` is not '@'. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to `-inf`.
    #State: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string. The length of `path` is at least 1. `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 0. `dp` is a list with length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is `1` and all other elements are `0`. If the first element of `path` is '*', then the first element of `dp` is `-inf` and all other elements are `0`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then all elements of `dp` remain `0`.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: `path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string. The length of `path` is at least 1, and `n` is the length of `path`, which is greater than 1. `dp` is a list with length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is `1` and all other elements are `0`. If the first element of `path` is '*', then the first element of `dp` is `-inf` and all other elements are `0`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then all elements of `dp` remain `0`. If the second element of `path` is '*', then the second element of `dp` is `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is not '*', then the second element of `dp` is `2` if `path[1]` is '@' or `1` if `path[1]` is not '@`.
    #State: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string. The length of `path` is at least 1, and `n` is the length of `path`, which is greater than 0. `dp` is a list with length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is `1` and all other elements are `0`. If the first element of `path` is '*', then the first element of `dp` is `-inf` and all other elements are `0`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then all elements of `dp` remain `0`. If `n` is greater than 1, and the second element of `path` is '*', then the second element of `dp` is `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is not '*', then the second element of `dp` is `2` if `path[1]` is '@' or `1` if `path[1]` is not '@'.
    for i in range(2, n):

            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: `path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string, `n` is the length of `path` and must be greater than 0, `dp` is a list with length `n` initialized based on the first and second elements of `path`, and all elements of `dp` from index 2 to `n-1` have been updated according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 2 to `n-1`, if `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and `i` is now equal to `n`.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. This value is calculated from the elements of `dp` which have been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, where `dp[i]` is set to `-inf` if `path[i]` is '*', otherwise `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `path`, a list of strings. It returns 0 if all elements in the derived list `dp` are set to negative infinity. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from `dp` that is greater than negative infinity, calculated based on the conditions specified for each element in `path`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. This value is calculated from the elements of `dp` which have been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, where `dp[i]` is set to `-inf` if `path[i]` is '*', otherwise `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
