Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the third element in `data`, `path` is the string at index 4 in `data`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing two results of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. Since `results` already contains one result from `func_1(path)`, after appending, `results` now contains two results of `func_1(path)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
