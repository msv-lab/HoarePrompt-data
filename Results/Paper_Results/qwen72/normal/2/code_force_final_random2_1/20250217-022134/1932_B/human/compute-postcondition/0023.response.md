Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all iterations of the loop have completed.
- The variable `n` holds the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed during the loop.
- The variable `path` holds the string at the last index in `data` that was processed during the loop.
- The list `data` remains unchanged, still representing the original input split by spaces.
- The variable `index` is now the final index after processing all elements, which is equal to the length of `data` minus the number of elements not processed by the loop.
- The list `results` contains the results of calling `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
