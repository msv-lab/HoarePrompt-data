The code snippet assigns the value of `int(data[index])` to the variable `n`. Given that `index` is 1, `data[index]` refers to the second element in the list `data`. Since `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `data[1]` is the second space-separated value from the input, which is expected to be a positive integer between 1 and 100.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `path` is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**.
