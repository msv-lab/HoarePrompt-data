The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` must contain at least two elements, and `result` is the second element in `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least three elements, and `result` will be the third element in `results`.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` must contain at least three elements, `result` is the third element in `results`**
