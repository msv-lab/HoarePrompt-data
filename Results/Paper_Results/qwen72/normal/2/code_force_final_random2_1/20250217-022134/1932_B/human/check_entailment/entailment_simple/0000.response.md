Reasoning:

The annotated program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the year when the nth sign occurs, considering that signs must occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign. However, the provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not perform this calculation. Instead, they seem to be attempting to solve a different problem involving dynamic programming with a list of symbols ('@', '*', and periodicities), which is not relevant to the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process a list of strings where each string can be '@', '*', or a periodicity. This is not aligned with the problem's requirement to handle a list of integers representing the periodicities of signs.
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is not appropriate for the problem. It seems to be solving a problem related to counting occurrences of '@' while avoiding '*', which is not what the problem asks for.

3. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input and processes it, but it calls `func_1` with a single string representing the periodicities, which is not the correct format for `func_1`.
   - The function `func_2` should be processing the periodicities as integers and using a different algorithm to calculate the year when the nth sign occurs.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - The correct solution would involve iterating through the list of periodicities and calculating the next year when each sign occurs, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
   - For example, if the periodicities are `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`, the correct algorithm would calculate the years as follows:
     - First sign occurs in year 3.
     - Second sign occurs in year 4 (next multiple of 2 after 3).
     - Third sign occurs in year 8 (next multiple of 4 after 4).
     - Fourth sign occurs in year 10 (next multiple of 5 after 8).
     - Fifth sign occurs in year 18 (next multiple of 9 after 10).
     - Sixth sign occurs in year 36 (next multiple of 18 after 18).

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
