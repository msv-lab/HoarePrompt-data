Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, considering the sequential nature of the signs. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve a different problem, specifically a path traversal problem where certain characters in a string represent obstacles or goals. This is entirely unrelated to the problem of calculating the year of the n-th sign based on periodic occurrences. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.

Final: **False**
