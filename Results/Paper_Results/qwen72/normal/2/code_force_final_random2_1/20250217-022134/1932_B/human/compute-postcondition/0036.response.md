Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list `path` as input, where each element in the list is a string representing either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity. The function processes this list to compute a dynamic programming array `dp` based on specific rules. If the list `path` is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it initializes `dp` and updates its values based on the characters in `path`. For each element in `path`, if the element is '*', the corresponding `dp` value is set to negative infinity. If the element is '@', the `dp` value is incremented by 1. The final value returned is the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. If all values in `dp` are negative infinity, the function returns 0. **
