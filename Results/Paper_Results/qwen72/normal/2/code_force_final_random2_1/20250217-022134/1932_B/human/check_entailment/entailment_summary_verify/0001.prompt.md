You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if path[0] == '@':
        dp[0] = 1
    elif path[0] == '*':
        dp[0] = -float('inf')
    if n > 1:
        if path[1] == '*':
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
    return max((x for x in dp if x > -float('inf')))

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        path = data[index]
        index += 1
        results.append(func_1(path))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases (up to 1000), where each test case involves a set of periodicities (up to 100). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1` with the periodicity data and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result. The function does not return any value but modifies the state by printing the results to the standard output.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, with the next sign occurring strictly after the previous one.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function appears to be designed for a different problem. It uses dynamic programming to process a string `path` where characters `@` and `*` have specific meanings. This function does not align with the problem statement about calculating the year of the nth sign.
     - The function initializes a DP array `dp` and processes the string `path` to calculate some score based on the presence of `@` and `*`.
     - The function returns the maximum value from the DP array that is not negative infinity.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - The input is split into a list `data`, and the function iterates over the test cases, extracting the number of signs `n` and the string `path`.
     - The function appends the result of `func_1(path)` to a list `results` and prints each result.

3. **Mismatch**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve a problem involving a string with characters `@` and `*`, which is not related to the problem of calculating the year of the nth sign based on periodicities.
   - The input processing in `func_2` also does not match the expected input format for the given problem, which involves reading integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions are designed for a different problem and do not address the requirements of calculating the year of the nth sign based on periodicities.
