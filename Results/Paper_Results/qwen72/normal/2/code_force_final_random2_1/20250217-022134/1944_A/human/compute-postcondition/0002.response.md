Initial State: `_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

Let's break down the logic step by step:

1. **Condition Check**: The condition `n - k <= 1` is evaluated.
   - If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, then the expression `n if n - k <= 1 else 1` evaluates to `n`.
   - If `n - k` is greater than 1, then the expression evaluates to `1`.

2. **Output Determination**:
   - If `n - k <= 1`, the output will be the value of `n`.
   - If `n - k > 1`, the output will be `1`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and their specific values are not provided.

Therefore, the output depends on the values of `n` and `k`:
- If `n - k <= 1`, the output will be `n`.
- If `n - k > 1`, the output will be `1`.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1 (where n and k are integers read from the input)**
