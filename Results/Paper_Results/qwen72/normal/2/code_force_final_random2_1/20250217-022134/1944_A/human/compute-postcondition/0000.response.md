The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Since `t` is already defined as a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), the input should match this value for the loop to execute correctly.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t` for the loop to execute `t` times.**
