You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2, representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: All iterations of the loop have completed. The variable `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each of the `t` test cases, the values of `n` and `k` were read from the input and the appropriate output was printed based on the condition `n if n - k <= 1 else 1`. The loop has executed exactly `t` times, and no further iterations will occur.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters for multiple test cases, where each test case includes the number of islands `n` and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed `k`. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given `n` and `k`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
