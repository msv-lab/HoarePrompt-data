The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`, both converted to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `int(input())` must be equal to `t` for the loop to execute `t` times.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `k` are set based on the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
