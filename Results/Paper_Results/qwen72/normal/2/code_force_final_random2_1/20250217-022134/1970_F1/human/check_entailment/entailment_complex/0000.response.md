Reasoning:  
The provided program has a significant issue with the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to update the position of a player based on a movement direction. However, the function fails to execute correctly because it attempts to unpack `b` (which is a tuple of movement directions) into `dx` and `dy`, but `b` is passed as a single integer instead of a tuple. This results in a `TypeError` when the function is called, causing the program to fail.

Additionally, the logic for checking if a player has scored a goal is flawed. The program checks if the player's position is in the list of goals, but it should check if the player is at the position of a goal of the opposite team. The current implementation will incorrectly increment the score if a player is at any goal, regardless of the team.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and will not produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
