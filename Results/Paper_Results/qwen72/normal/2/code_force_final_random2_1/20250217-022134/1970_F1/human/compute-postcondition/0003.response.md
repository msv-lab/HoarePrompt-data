The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of a field, with the constraints that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both `a` and `b` are odd. Due to an error in the function, `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`, and therefore the function does not return any values.
