Reasoning:  
The program has a logical issue with the function `func_1`. The function is supposed to take a tuple representing the current position of a player and a tuple representing the direction of movement, and return the new position after the movement. However, the function `func_1` is called with `mouvements[mo[1]]`, which correctly provides a tuple like `(-1, 0)` for 'L'. But the function itself incorrectly unpacks `b` (which is a tuple) directly into `dx, dy` without handling the case where `b` might not be a tuple (though in this specific context, it always should be).

However, the more critical issue is that the function `func_1` is not used correctly in the context of the game logic. Specifically, the function is supposed to update the position of the player, but the program does not handle the case where the player is carrying the Quaffle. Additionally, the function does not check if the new position is within the bounds of the field, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where a player catches the Quaffle (`C` action) or when the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
