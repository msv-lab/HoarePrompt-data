The function `func_1` is intended to take two parameters `a` and `b`, both expected to be tuples or lists containing two integers. However, due to an error in the code where `b` is incorrectly treated as a single integer instead of a tuple or list, the function fails to execute correctly and does not return any values. As a result, the function does not modify the state of the program or produce any output.
