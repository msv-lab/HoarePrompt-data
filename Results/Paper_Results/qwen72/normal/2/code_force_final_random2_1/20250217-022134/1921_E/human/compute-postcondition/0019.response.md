Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is `r[0]`.
   - `m` is `r[1]`.
   - `x1` is `r[2] + 1`.
   - `x2` is `r[4]`.
   - `y2` is `r[5]`.
   - `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where:
     - 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6
     - 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9
     - Either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - However, the condition `y1 == y2` is true, which implies that the initial condition `y1 != y2` must have been false, meaning the current value of `y1` must be such that `y1 == y2`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The condition `y1 == y2` being true contradicts the initial condition `y1 != y2`. This suggests that there might be a logical inconsistency in the problem setup. However, for the purpose of determining the output, we need to focus on the given conditions and the print statement.
   - The print statement simply prints the string 'Alice'.

Given the conditions and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
