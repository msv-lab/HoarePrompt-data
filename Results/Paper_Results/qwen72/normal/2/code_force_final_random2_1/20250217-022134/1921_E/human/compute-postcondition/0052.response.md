Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is `r[0]`, which is the first element of the list `r`.
- `m` is `r[1]`, which is the second element of the list `r`.
- `x1` is `r[2]`, which is the third element of the list `r`.
- `y1` is `r[3]`, which is the fourth element of the list `r`.
- `x2` is `r[4]`, which is the fifth element of the list `r`.
- `y2` is `r[5]`, which is the sixth element of the list `r`.
- `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] with specific constraints.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
- The current value of `y1` is equal to the current value of `y2`.

The print statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('bob')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'bob'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this print statement.

Output: **bob**
