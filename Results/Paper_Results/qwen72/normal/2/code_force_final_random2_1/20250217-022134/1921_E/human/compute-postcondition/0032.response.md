Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]` with the following constraints:
     - \( 1 \leq x_a, x_b \leq h \leq 10^6 \)
     - \( 1 \leq y_a, y_b \leq w \leq 10^9 \)
     - Either \( x_a \neq x_b \) or \( y_a \neq y_b \)
   - `x1` is defined as `r[2] + 1 + a`
   - `x2` is defined as `r[4] - a`
   - `y2` is `r[5]`
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`
   - If `y1` â‰¥ `y2`, then `a` is `r[5] - 1`
   - If `y1` < `y2`, then `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`

2. **Conditions:**
   - The condition `x2` is greater than `x1` is explicitly stated.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.

3. **Additional Conditions:**
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the final condition:
- The condition `x2` is greater than `x1` is true.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.

However, the additional condition states that either:
- `x2` is less than or equal to `x1` (which is false because `x2` is greater than `x1`)
- `x1` is less than 1 (which is not necessarily true based on the given constraints)
- `x2` is greater than `n` (which is not necessarily true based on the given constraints)

Since the additional condition must be satisfied, and the only condition that can be true is `x2` is greater than `n`, this implies that `x2` is indeed greater than `n`.

Therefore, the `print('draw')` statement will execute under these conditions.

Output: **draw**
