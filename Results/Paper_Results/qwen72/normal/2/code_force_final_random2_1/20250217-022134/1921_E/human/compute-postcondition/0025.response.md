Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is less than `y2`, `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`.** 

Explanation:
- The variable `a` is assigned the value `m - y2`.
- `m` is `r[1]` and `y2` is `r[5]`, so `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
