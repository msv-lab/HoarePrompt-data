Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is [1], `lex` is an input integer - 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `lex` is less than 27.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `lex` is the original value of `lex` minus 1.
- Since the original value of `lex` was less than 28, the new value of `lex` is now less than 27.
- All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
