To determine what will be printed by the `print(temp)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
- `cases` must be greater than 0.
- `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers.
- `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `i` is 0.
- `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[0][0] + 96`, `info[0][1] + 96`, and `info[0][2] + 96`.
- `j` is 2.

### Explanation:
1. **`info[0]`**: This is the first sublist in the `info` list. Since each sublist contains three sorted integers, let's denote these integers as `a`, `b`, and `c` where `a ≤ b ≤ c`.

2. **ASCII Values**:
   - `info[0][0] + 96`: This converts the first integer in the sublist to a character by adding 96 to its value and converting it to an ASCII character.
   - `info[0][1] + 96`: This converts the second integer in the sublist to a character by adding 96 to its value and converting it to an ASCII character.
   - `info[0][2] + 96`: This converts the third integer in the sublist to a character by adding 96 to its value and converting it to an ASCII character.

3. **String Construction**:
   - `temp` is constructed by concatenating the characters obtained from the above conversions.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `info[0]` is `[1, 2, 3]` (a typical sorted list of three integers).

- `info[0][0] + 96 = 1 + 96 = 97` → ASCII value 97 corresponds to the character 'a'.
- `info[0][1] + 96 = 2 + 96 = 98` → ASCII value 98 corresponds to the character 'b'.
- `info[0][2] + 96 = 3 + 96 = 99` → ASCII value 99 corresponds to the character 'c'.

Thus, `temp` would be the string `'abc'`.

### General Case:
For any sublist `[a, b, c]` in `info[0]`, the characters in `temp` will be:
- `chr(a + 96)`
- `chr(b + 96)`
- `chr(c + 96)`

### Final Output:
The `print(temp)` statement will print the string `temp` which is constructed from the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[0][0] + 96`, `info[0][1] + 96`, and `info[0][2] + 96`.

Output: **temp (where temp is the string formed by the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of info[0][0] + 96, info[0][1] + 96, and info[0][2] + 96)**

For example, if `info[0]` is `[1, 2, 3]`, the output will be:
Output: **abc**
