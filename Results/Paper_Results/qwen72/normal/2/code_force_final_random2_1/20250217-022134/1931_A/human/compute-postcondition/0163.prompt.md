You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer `n` as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded value of a three-letter word.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is the initial input integer, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers representing the values of `lex` after processing, and `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration. The variables `i` and `j` are not relevant outside the loop context.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is the initial input integer, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is `cases - 1`, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`, `j` is 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and returns the corresponding three-letter word based on the encoded value `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
