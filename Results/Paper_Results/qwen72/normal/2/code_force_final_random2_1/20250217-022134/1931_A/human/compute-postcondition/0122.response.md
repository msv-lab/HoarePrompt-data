Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `arr` is now [1, 26] if the original `lex` was less than 28, [26, 26] if the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), and [26] if the original `lex` was greater than 78.**
