Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `lex` is `lex - 1`, and `arr` is `[1, 1]` if `lex - 1` < 28, `[26, 1]` if 28 ≤ `lex - 1` < 52 or 52 ≤ `lex - 1` ≤ 78, and `[1]` if `lex - 1` > 78.**
