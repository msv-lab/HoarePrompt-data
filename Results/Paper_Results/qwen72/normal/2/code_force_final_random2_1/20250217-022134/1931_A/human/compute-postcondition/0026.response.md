The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 28 (as per the conditions for `arr`), subtracting 26 from `lex` means `lex` is now between 2 and 52 (inclusive). This affects the value of `arr` as follows:

- If `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive) before the operation, it will now be between 2 and 26 (inclusive), which means `arr` will be [1, 26].
- If `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive) before the operation, it will now be between 26 and 52 (inclusive), which means `arr` will be [26, 26].

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` < 28, [26, 26] if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, and [26] if `lex` > 78 or [26, 26] if 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` < 28, [26, 26] if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, and [26] if `lex` > 78 or [26, 26] if 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.**
