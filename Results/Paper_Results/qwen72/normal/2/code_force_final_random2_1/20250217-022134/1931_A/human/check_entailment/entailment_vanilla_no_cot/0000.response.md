Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the generation of the lexicographically smallest word for all possible inputs. Specifically, the logic used to distribute the values among the three letters is flawed. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The program attempts to distribute the highest possible values (26) to the first two letters and then sorts the array. This approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for the input `24`, the program might produce `aav` instead of `cat`.

2. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The conditions used to distribute the values (e.g., `if lex < 28`, `elif lex < 52`, etc.) are not comprehensive and do not cover all possible cases. This can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

3. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array after distributing the values does not necessarily result in the lexicographically smallest word. The order of the letters is crucial, and sorting them can disrupt the correct order.

To correctly solve this problem, a more systematic approach is needed to ensure that the lexicographically smallest word is generated. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the three letters with the smallest possible values
        a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
        remaining = lex - 3  # Subtract the initial values of 'a', 'b', and 'c'
        
        # Distribute the remaining value to the letters
        while remaining > 0:
            if remaining >= 25 and c < 26:
                c += 25
                remaining -= 25
            elif remaining >= 25 and b < 26:
                b += 25
                remaining -= 25
            else:
                a += remaining
                remaining = 0
        
        # Convert the values to characters
        result = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is generated by distributing the remaining value to the letters in a way that maintains the correct order.
