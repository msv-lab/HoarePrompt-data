Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `temp` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[1][2] + 96`.
- All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, `lex`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
