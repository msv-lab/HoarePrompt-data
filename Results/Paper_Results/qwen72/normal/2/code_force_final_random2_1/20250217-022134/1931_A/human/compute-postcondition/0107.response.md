The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `info`) remain unchanged. The specific value of `lex` after the decrement depends on its initial value, but it will be one less than what it was before.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `lex` is `lex - 1`.**
