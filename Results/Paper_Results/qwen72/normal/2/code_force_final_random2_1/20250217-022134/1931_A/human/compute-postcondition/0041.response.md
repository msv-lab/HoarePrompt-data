The code `arr.append(lex)` adds the value of `lex` to the end of the list `arr`. The initial state specifies different conditions for `lex` and the corresponding values of `arr`. We need to consider each case:

1. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 1] and `lex` is reduced by 2, making `lex` less than 26.
2. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` negative or zero.
3. If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` between 0 and 26.
4. If `lex` > 78, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` greater than 26 but less than or equal to 78.

After appending `lex` to `arr`, the new state of `arr` will be:

- If `lex` < 28, `arr` becomes [1, 1, `lex`].
- If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` becomes [26, 26, `lex`].
- If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` becomes [26, 26, `lex`].
- If `lex` > 78, `arr` becomes [26, 26, `lex`].

The values of `n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`] if `lex` < 28, `arr` is [26, 26, `lex`] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and `lex` is reduced by 52 if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.**
