Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `info` is [[1, 1, lex]], `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is [1], and `lex` is the input integer with the current value of `lex` being less than 27.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `lex` is one less than its previous value, which was less than 28. All other variables remain unchanged.
