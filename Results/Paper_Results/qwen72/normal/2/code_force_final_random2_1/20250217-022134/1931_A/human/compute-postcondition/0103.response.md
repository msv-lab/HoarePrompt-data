Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, and `lex` is greater than or equal to 28. If `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is now `lex - 26` (which is between -24 and 26). Otherwise, if `lex` > 78, `arr` remains an empty list and `lex` is the input integer. If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is `lex - 26` (which is between 26 and 52).***
