Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], [1, 26], or [26, 26]. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 1] or [26, 1], `lex` is the input integer minus 2, and `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 2]]. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [1, 26] or [26, 26], `lex` is the input integer minus 52, and `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 52]]. If 52 ≤ `lex` < 78, `arr` is [26, 26], `lex` is the input integer minus 52, and `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]]. If `lex` ≥ 78, `arr` is [26, 26], `lex` is the input integer minus 52, and `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]].**

Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly 2 times because `j` ranges from 0 to 1 (inclusive).
- After the first iteration, `lex` is reduced by 1 or 26 depending on its initial value.
- After the second iteration, `lex` is further reduced by 1 or 26 again, leading to the final values of `lex` and `arr` as described above.
- The variable `info` is updated based on the final value of `lex` after both iterations.
