Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96` and `info[1][1] + 96`, `j` is 1.** 

Explanation: The variable `temp` was initially a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[1][0] + 96`. After executing the code, `temp` is updated to include an additional character, which corresponds to the ASCII value of `info[1][1] + 96`. All other variables remain unchanged.
