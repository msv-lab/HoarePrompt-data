The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` updates the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from its current value. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `n` remains an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
- `cases` remains greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` remains 1.
- `info` remains updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value.
- The value of `lex` is reduced by 26.

Given the conditions for `lex`:
- If `lex` was initially less than 28, `arr` was `[1, 26]`, and `lex` was the input integer minus 1. After the code, `lex` becomes `input integer - 27`.
- If `lex` was initially between 28 and 52 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` was `[26, 26]`, and `lex` was `lex - 26`. After the code, `lex` becomes `lex - 52`.
- If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` was `[26]`, and `lex` was the input integer. After the code, `lex` becomes `input integer - 26`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `info` includes the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, and `lex` is reduced by 26.**

Specifically:
- If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `input integer - 27`.
- If `lex` was initially between 28 and 52 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `lex` is now `lex - 52`.
- If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `lex` is now `input integer - 26`.
