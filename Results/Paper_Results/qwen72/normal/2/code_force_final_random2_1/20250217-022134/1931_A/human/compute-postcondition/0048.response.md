The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute regardless of the initial values of `j` because the range is set to `2`, which means the loop will run twice. However, for the loop to start correctly, `j` should be initialized to a value that aligns with the typical starting point of a loop, which is `0`.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if `lex` < 28, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, and `lex` is the input integer**
