The code `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Let's consider the different cases based on the initial state:

1. If `lex` < 28:
   - `arr` is either [1, 1] or [26, 1]
   - `lex` is the input integer minus 2
   - `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 2]]

2. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52:
   - `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26]
   - `lex` is the input integer minus 52
   - `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 52]]

3. If 52 ≤ `lex` < 78:
   - `arr` is [26, 26]
   - `lex` is the input integer minus 52
   - `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]]

4. If `lex` ≥ 78:
   - `arr` is [26, 26]
   - `lex` is the input integer minus 52
   - `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]]

In all cases, `arr` will have `lex` appended to it. The other variables (`n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, and `info`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [26, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 26, lex], or [26, 26, lex], depending on the initial value of `lex`, `lex` is the input integer minus 2, 52, or 52 (as per the conditions), and `info` is either [[1, 1, lex - 2]], [[1, 1, lex - 52]], [[26, 26, lex - 52]], or [[26, 26, lex - 52]], depending on the initial value of `lex`.**
