Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 2, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[2][0] + 96` and `info[2][1] + 96`, `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new character to the string `temp`. This character is determined by converting the integer `info[i][j] + 96` to its corresponding ASCII character using the `chr` function.
- Before the code execution, `temp` was a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][0] + 96`.
- After the code execution, `temp` now contains the characters corresponding to both `info[2][0] + 96` and `info[2][1] + 96`.
- All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, `lex`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
