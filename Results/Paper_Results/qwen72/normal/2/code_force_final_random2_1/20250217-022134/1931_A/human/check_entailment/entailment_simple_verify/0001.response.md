### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It iterates over a fixed range of 2 (to determine the positions of the first two letters).
   - Inside the loop, it checks the value of `lex` (the encoded sum) and appends the appropriate values to `arr`:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 52, it appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program constructs the final word by converting the positions in `arr` to their corresponding characters and prints the result.

### Issues:
- **Flawed Logic for Lexicographically Smallest Word**:
  - The conditions for appending values to `arr` do not always ensure the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might incorrectly append 26 and 1, leading to a non-optimal solution.
  - The program does not handle cases where the sum can be split into different combinations of letters that result in the same total but are not lexicographically smallest.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start with the smallest possible values for the first two letters and adjust the third letter accordingly.
- We need to ensure that the sum of the positions of the three letters equals the given encoded value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the positions of the letters
        a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
        # Adjust the positions to match the encoded value
        while a + b + c < lex:
            if c < 26:
                c += 1
            elif b < 26:
                b += 1
                c = 1
            else:
                a += 1
                b = 1
                c = 1
        # Convert positions to characters
        word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(word)
```

### Explanation:
- We initialize `a`, `b`, and `c` to 1, representing the smallest possible values for the letters.
- We increment the positions starting from the last letter (`c`) and moving to the first letter (`a`) if necessary, ensuring the sum matches the encoded value.
- Finally, we convert the positions to their corresponding characters and print the result.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for determining the lexicographically smallest word.

Final: **False**
