Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26]. If `lex` ≤ 78, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, lex]] if the original `lex` < 28, or [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 28 ≤ original `lex` < 52, or [[26, 26, lex - 78]] if original `lex` ≥ 52, and `lex` is the original `lex` - 26. If `lex` > 78, `info` and `arr` remain unchanged.***
