The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Based on the initial conditions, `arr` could be one of three possible lists: `[1]`, `[26]`, or an empty list `[]`. After appending 26 to `arr`, the new value of `arr` will be:

- If `lex` < 28, `arr` was `[1]` and becomes `[1, 26]`.
- If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52 or 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` was `[26]` and becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` > 78, `arr` was `[]` and becomes `[26]`.

The values of `n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `info` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is `[1, 26]`, and `lex` is the input integer minus 1. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52 or 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]`, and `lex` is `lex - 26` (which is between -24 and 52). If `lex` > 78, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` is the input integer.**
