Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `arr` has one more element which is the current value of `lex`. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 1, lex] and `lex` is the input integer minus 2. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26, 26, lex] and `lex` is now `lex - 52` (which is between -24 and 26). If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26, 26, lex] and `lex` is `lex - 52` (which is between 0 and 26). If `lex` > 78, `arr` is [lex] and `lex` is the input integer.**
