The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit, which is 2. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `arr` is either [1] or [26]. If `lex` < 28, `info` is [[1, 1, lex]], and `lex` is the input integer with the current value of `lex` being less than 28. If `lex` ≥ 28, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]]. If `lex` < 52, `lex` is an integer where 28 ≤ lex ≤ 51. If `lex` ≥ 52, `info` is updated to [[26, 26, lex - 78]], and `lex` is an integer where 28 ≤ lex ≤ 78.**
