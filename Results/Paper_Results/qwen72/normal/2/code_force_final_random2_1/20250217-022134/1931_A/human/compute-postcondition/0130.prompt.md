Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer, `info` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex < 28:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        elif lex <= 78:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    info.append(arr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if `lex` < 28, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, lex] if `lex` < 28, `arr` is [26, 26, lex - 52] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and `lex` is reduced by 52 if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is one of [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 26, lex], `lex` is the input integer minus 2, 52, or 52, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `arr` is sorted in ascending order, and `lex` remains the same as before the code execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
