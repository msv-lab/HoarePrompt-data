Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `arr` is [26], `lex` is now `lex - 26`, `info` is updated to include the new list `[26]` appended to its existing value, and `lex` is greater than or equal to 26 and less than or equal to 52.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.
- Since the initial value of `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from it results in a new value of `lex` that is between 26 and 52 (inclusive).
- All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, and `info`) remain unchanged.
