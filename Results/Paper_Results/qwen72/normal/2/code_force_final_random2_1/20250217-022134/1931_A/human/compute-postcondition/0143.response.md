The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range defined as `range(3)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute 3 times regardless of the values of other variables, as long as the range is from 0 to 2 (inclusive). The variable `j` starts at 0 for the loop to execute its first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is an empty string, `j` is 0**
