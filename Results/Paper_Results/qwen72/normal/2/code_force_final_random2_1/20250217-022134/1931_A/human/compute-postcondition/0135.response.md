The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range limit `3`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The range limit remains 3, as it is defined by the `range(3)` statement in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 0, `temp` is now a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[0][0] + 96`, `j` is 1**
