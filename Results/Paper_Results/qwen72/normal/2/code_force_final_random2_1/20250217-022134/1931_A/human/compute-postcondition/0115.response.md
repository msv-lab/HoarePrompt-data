Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` > 78, `arr` remains an empty list and `lex` is the input integer.***
