Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is [1], `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0, and the current value of `lex` is less than 28.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` was an empty list, so after appending 1, `arr` becomes [1]. All other variables remain unchanged.
