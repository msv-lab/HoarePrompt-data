To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the typical starting point for a `range` function in Python.

Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is the initial input integer, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, and `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration. However, for the loop to execute, the critical adjustments are:

- `cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should start at 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 0**
