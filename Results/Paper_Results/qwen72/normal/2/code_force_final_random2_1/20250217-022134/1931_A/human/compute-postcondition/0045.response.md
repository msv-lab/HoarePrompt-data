The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `cases` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if `lex` < 28, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, lex] if `lex` < 28, `arr` is [26, 26, lex - 52] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and `lex` is reduced by 52 if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.**
