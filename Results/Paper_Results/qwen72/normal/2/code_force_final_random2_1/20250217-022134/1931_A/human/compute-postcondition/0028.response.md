Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `lex` < 52, `lex` is reduced by 26 and `arr` is [26]. If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` is [26]. If `lex` > 78, `arr` is an empty list and `lex` remains unchanged.***
