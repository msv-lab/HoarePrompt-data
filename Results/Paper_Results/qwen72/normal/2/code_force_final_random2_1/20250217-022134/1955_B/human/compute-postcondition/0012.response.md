The code `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)` appends the result of the expression `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `h` is 0, the term `d * h` evaluates to 0, simplifying the expression to `a + k * c`. The values of `a`, `k`, and `c` are not specified, so they remain as they are. The list `li` is updated with this new element.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 0, `li` is updated with the value `a + k * c`.**
