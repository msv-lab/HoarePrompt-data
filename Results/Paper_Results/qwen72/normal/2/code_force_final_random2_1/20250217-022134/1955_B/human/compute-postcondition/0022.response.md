The only variables in the loop head are `h` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `h` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is `n-1` and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be incremented by 1, making it `n`.

However, since `h` is now equal to `n`, the condition `h < n` will no longer be true, and the loop will not execute again. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the termination condition) is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is `n`, `li` has `2 * n + 1` elements, where the first `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are also `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the last element is `a + k * c + d * (n-1)`, `k` is `n`**
