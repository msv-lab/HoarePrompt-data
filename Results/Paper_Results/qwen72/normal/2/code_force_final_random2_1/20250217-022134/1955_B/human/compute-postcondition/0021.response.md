Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is `n-1`, `li` has `2 * n + 1` elements, where the first `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are also `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the last element is `a + k * c + d * (n-1)`, `k` is `n`.**
