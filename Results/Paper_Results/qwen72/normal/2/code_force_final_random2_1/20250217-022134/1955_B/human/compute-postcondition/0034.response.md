The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6.
- `l` is a list of n^2 integers where 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ 10^9.

The function returns 'yes' in some cases and 'no' in others, based on the input parameters and their relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. It returns 'yes' in certain conditions and 'no' in other conditions based on the values of these parameters.**
