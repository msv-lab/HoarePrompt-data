Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `k` is `n`, `h` is `n-1`, and `li` has `n^2` elements, where each element is `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.**

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `n` retains its original value within the range 2 to 500. The variable `k` will have the value `n` because the outer loop runs `n` times. The variable `h` will be `n-1` because the inner loop runs `n` times for each iteration of the outer loop. The list `li` will contain `n^2` elements, with each element calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `k` ranges from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. This means `li` will have a total of `n^2` unique values based on the given formula.
