Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is `n`, `li` has `2 * n + 3` elements, where the first `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are also `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the second-to-last element is `a + k * c + d * (n-1)`, the third-to-last element is `a + n * c + d * n`, and the last element is `a + k * c + d * h`, `k` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The list `li` initially had `2 * n + 2` elements.
- The code `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)` adds one more element to the list `li`.
- The new element added is `a + k * c + d * h`, which is consistent with the pattern of the elements in `li`.
- Therefore, the length of `li` is now `2 * n + 3`.
- All other variables (`n`, `h`, `k`) remain unchanged.
- The structure of `li` remains the same, with the new element appended to the end.
