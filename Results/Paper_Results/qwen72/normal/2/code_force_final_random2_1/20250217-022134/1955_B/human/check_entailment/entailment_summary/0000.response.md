Reasoning:  
The program is designed to check if a given list of numbers can form a progressive square as defined by the problem statement. The key steps in the program are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases, the parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of integers.
2. **Minimum Value Calculation**: The program finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
3. **Progressive Square Construction**: It constructs a new list `li` by calculating each element as `a + k * c + d * h` for all possible values of `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
4. **Comparison**: It sorts both the original list `l` and the newly constructed list `li` and checks if they are equal.
5. **Output**: Based on the comparison, it prints 'yes' if the lists match and 'no' otherwise.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Progressive Square Construction**:
  - The formula `a + k * c + d * h` correctly generates the elements of the progressive square based on the given rules.
  - The program iterates over all possible values of `k` and `h` to ensure all elements are included in the list `li`.

- **Sorting and Comparison**:
  - Sorting both lists before comparison is a valid approach because the order of elements in the input list `l` is not guaranteed.
  - The comparison ensures that the elements in `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the constraints well, including the range of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the size of the input list `l`.
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
