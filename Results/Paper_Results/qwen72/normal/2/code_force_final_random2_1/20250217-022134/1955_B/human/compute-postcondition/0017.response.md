Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 2, `li` has a new element `a + k * c + d * h` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `li`. This new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Since `h` is 2, the expression simplifies to `a + k * c + 2 * d`. The values of `n` and `h` remain unchanged. The list `li` now includes this new element.
