Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is `n-1`, `li` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains unchanged, `h` is now equal to `n-1`, and the list `li` contains `n` elements. Each element in `li` is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `h` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.
