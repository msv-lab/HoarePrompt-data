Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if the given array `b` can form the progressive square with the specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. The program follows these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the array `l`.
3. It finds the minimum value in the array `l`, which corresponds to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square.
4. It generates the expected values of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
5. It sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l`.
6. It compares the sorted lists to determine if they are equal, indicating that the input array can form the progressive square.

The logic and implementation are correct, and the program should work as expected for the given problem description.
