The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the initial condition of `num_up_coins` being odd or even, the list `results` now contains an additional 'NO'. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0 but decremented by 1, `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is the value of `data[4]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `data[4]`. If `num_up_coins` was odd, `results` is a list containing two elements ['YES', 'NO']. If `num_up_coins` was even, `results` is a list containing two elements ['NO', 'NO'].**
