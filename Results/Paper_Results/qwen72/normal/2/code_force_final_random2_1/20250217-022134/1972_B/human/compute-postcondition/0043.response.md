Output State: **`t` is 0, `index` is `1 + 2 * t_initial`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd or even, and `results` has exactly `t_initial` elements.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: The variable `t` remains 0 throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`index` is `1 + 2 * t_initial`**: The variable `index` is set to `1 + 2 * t_initial` before the loop starts and is not modified within the loop.
- **`results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd or even**: This describes the content of the `results` list, which is populated based on the initial conditions.
- **`results` has exactly `t_initial` elements**: Since the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list, and the loop completes, the `results` list must have exactly `t_initial` elements, as specified in the initial state.
