Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is 0, `index` is `1 + 2 * t_initial`, where `t_initial` is the initial value of `t`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd or even. The final `results` list will have `t_initial` elements.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: After all iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` implicitly with each iteration.
- **`index`**: The `index` variable increments by 2 for each iteration (once for `n` and once for `s`). Since there are `t_initial` iterations, `index` will be `1 + 2 * t_initial`.
- **`results`**: The `results` list will contain `t_initial` elements, each being 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, and 'NO' if it is even.
