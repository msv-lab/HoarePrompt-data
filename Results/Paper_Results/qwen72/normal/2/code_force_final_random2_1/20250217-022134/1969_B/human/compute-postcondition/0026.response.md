To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `ans` step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`.
- `cnt` is a list where:
  - `cnt[0]` is the number of times 0 appears in `s`.
  - `cnt[1]` is the number of times 1 appears in `s`.
- `ans` is the sum of:
  - The number of times 0 appears in `s` when there is at least one 1 before it.
  - The number of times 1 appears in `s` multiplied by the number of times 0 appears in `s` minus the number of times 0 has been counted so far.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Counting 0s with at least one 1 before them:**
   - We need to iterate through the list `s` and count the number of 0s that have at least one 1 before them.
   - Let's denote this count as `count_0_with_1_before`.

2. **Counting 1s and 0s:**
   - `cnt[0]` is the total number of 0s in `s`.
   - `cnt[1]` is the total number of 1s in `s`.

3. **Calculating the second part of `ans`:**
   - The second part of `ans` is the number of times 1 appears in `s` multiplied by the number of times 0 appears in `s` minus the number of times 0 has been counted so far.
   - This can be expressed as: `cnt[1] * (cnt[0] - count_0_with_1_before)`.

4. **Summing up both parts:**
   - `ans = count_0_with_1_before + cnt[1] * (cnt[0] - count_0_with_1_before)`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`:
- `cnt[0] = 3` (number of 0s)
- `cnt[1] = 3` (number of 1s)
- `count_0_with_1_before = 2` (0s at indices 1 and 3 have at least one 1 before them).

Then:
- `ans = 2 + 3 * (3 - 2) = 2 + 3 * 1 = 2 + 3 = 5`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the calculation of `ans`, the `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` as described above.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the number of times 0 appears in s when there is at least one 1 before it, plus the number of times 1 appears in s multiplied by the number of times 0 appears in s minus the number of times 0 has been counted so far)**.
