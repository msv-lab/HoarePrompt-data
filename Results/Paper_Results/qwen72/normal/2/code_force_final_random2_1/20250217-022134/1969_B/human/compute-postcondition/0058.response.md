The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the list `cnt`. Given that `c` is the first element in the list `s`, and `cnt` is initially `[0, 0]`, the value of `cnt[c]` will be incremented by 1.

- If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
- If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` will be incremented from 0 to 1.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input string that must have at least one element, `n` is greater than `len(s)`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[1, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[0, 1]` if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element in the list `s`.**
