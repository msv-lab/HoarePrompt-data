Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least three elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` and `ans` is `zeroes - 2`. If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is `[0, 3]` and `ans` is `2 * zeroes + 1` if the else part is executed, otherwise `ans` is `3 * zeroes`.***
