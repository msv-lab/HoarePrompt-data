The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Let's analyze the impact:

- If `c` is 0, then `cnt` was initially `[1, 0]` and `ans` was 0. After executing `cnt[c] += 1`, `cnt` becomes `[2, 0]`.
- If `c` is not 0, then `cnt` was initially `[0, 1]` and `ans` was `zeroes`. After executing `cnt[c] += 1`, `cnt` becomes `[0, 2]`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least two elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `c` is the second element of the list `s`. If `c` is 0, then `cnt` is `[2, 0]` and `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, then `cnt` is `[0, 2]` and `ans` is `zeroes`.**
