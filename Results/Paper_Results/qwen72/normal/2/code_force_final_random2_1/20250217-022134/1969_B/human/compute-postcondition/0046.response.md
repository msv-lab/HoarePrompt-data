The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[c]` by 1. This affects the count of the digit `c` in the `cnt` dictionary. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least 2 elements, `c` is the third element of `s`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is now `cnt[c] + 1`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is now `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**
