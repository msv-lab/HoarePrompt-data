Correctness: **True**

The provided solution appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. The solution calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order by counting the transitions that require a shift operation, which aligns with the problem statement. The logic for calculating the cost is based on the count of '0's and '1's and their positions, which is consistent with the requirement to minimize the total cost of cyclic shifts. Therefore, the solution is correct based on the problem description.
