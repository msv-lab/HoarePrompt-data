### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost to achieve this.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it converts the input string into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string.
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the counter array.
   - For each character, it calculates the cost of making the string sorted up to that point and adds it to the total cost `ans`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current character is 0, it adds 1 to the total cost if there has been at least one 1 encountered before.
   - If the current character is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeros to the total cost.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the string is entirely composed of 0s or 1s.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is O(n) for each test case, where n is the length of the string.
   - The space complexity is O(n) due to the list conversion and additional counters.

6. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly calculates the minimum cost for the provided examples:
     - For "10", the cost is 2.
     - For "0000", the cost is 0.
     - For "11000", the cost is 9.
     - For "101011", the cost is 5.
     - For "01101001", the cost is 11.

7. **Annotated Code Review**:
   - The annotations confirm that the state of the program is correctly maintained throughout the execution.
   - The function correctly processes each test case and calculates the total cost accurately.
   - The final state of the program after processing all test cases is as expected.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
