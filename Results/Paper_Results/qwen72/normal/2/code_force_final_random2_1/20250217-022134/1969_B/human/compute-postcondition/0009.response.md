Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least one element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[1, 0]` because `c` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `c` is the first element of the list `s` which is 0.**
