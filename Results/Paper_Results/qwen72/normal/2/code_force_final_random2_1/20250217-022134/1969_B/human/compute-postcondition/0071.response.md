The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1.

- If `c` is 0, `cnt` was initially `[2, 0]`, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes `[3, 0]`.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt` was initially `[0, 2]`, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes `[0, 3]`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input string that must have at least two elements, `n` is greater than `len(s)`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[0, 3]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the third element in the list `s`, `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, or `2 * zeroes` if `c` is 1.**
