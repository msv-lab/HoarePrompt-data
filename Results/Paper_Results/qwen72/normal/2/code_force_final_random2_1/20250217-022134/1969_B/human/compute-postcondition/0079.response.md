Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calculates the sum of the number of times a '1' appears before each '0' in the string, plus the total number of '0's multiplied by the number of '1's. It prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state includes `n` being 0 (indicating the loop has completed), `s` being the last processed binary string as a list of integers, `zeroes` being the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt` being a list with the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, and `ans` being the calculated result for the last test case. **
