Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least two elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `c` is the second element of the list `s`. If `c` is 0, then `cnt` is `[2, 0]` and `ans` is `zeroes - 2`. If `c` is not 0, then `cnt` is `[0, 2]` and `ans` is `2 * zeroes`.**
