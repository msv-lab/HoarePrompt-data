Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input string, `n` is greater than `len(s)`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[zeroes, len(s) - zeroes]`, and `ans` is the sum of the number of times a 1 appears before each 0 in the list `s` plus the total number of 0s multiplied by the number of 1s.**

### Explanation:
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt[0]` will be the total number of 0s in the list `s`, which is `zeroes`. Similarly, `cnt[1]` will be the total number of 1s in the list `s`, which is `len(s) - zeroes`.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` accumulates the value based on the conditions inside the loop. For each 0 in the list `s`, `ans` increases by 1 if there is at least one 1 before it. For each 1 in the list `s`, `ans` increases by the number of 0s that have not been counted yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`). Therefore, `ans` ends up being the sum of the number of times a 1 appears before each 0 in the list `s` plus the total number of 0s multiplied by the number of 1s.
