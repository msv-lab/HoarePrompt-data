### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation allows us to select any contiguous subarray and insert its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum of the array `a` is calculated using `s = sum(a)`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The variable `t` is used to store the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found so far.
   - The variable `tmp` is used to keep track of the current sum of the subarray being considered.
   - For each element `x` in the array `a`, `tmp` is updated by adding `x`. If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0 (since a negative sum would not contribute to maximizing the total sum).
   - `t` is updated to the maximum of `t` and `tmp`.

4. **Final Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the value of `t` is doubled and added to `ans`, with the result taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases `T` and processing each test case independently.
   - The use of `MOD` ensures that the results are within the required range.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program efficiently calculates the maximum subarray sum using a single pass through the array.
   - The operations are performed in \(O(n)\) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, taking into account the constraints and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
