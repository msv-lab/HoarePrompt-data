Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `_` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) * (2^(k-1)) % MOD`; `i` is `0`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD) % MOD`.**

### Explanation:
- **`T`**: Remains unchanged as it is read from the standard input and is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains unchanged as it is set to 2 and not modified within the loop.
- **`n` and `k`**: These are read from the standard input and are not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: This is a list of integers read from the standard input and is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: The sum of the elements in `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`t`**: Initially, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`. In each iteration of the loop, `t` is multiplied by 2 and then taken modulo `MOD`. After `k-1` iterations, `t` becomes `((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) * (2^(k-1)) % MOD`.
- **`i`**: Initially, `i` is `k-1`. After `k-1` iterations, `i` becomes `0`.
- **`ans`**: Initially, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. In each iteration, `t` is added to `ans` and then taken modulo `MOD`. After `k-1` iterations, `ans` becomes `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD) % MOD`.
