To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

1. The variable `i` is the loop counter and will start at 0.
2. The variable `k` determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute at least once, `k - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `k` must be greater than 1.

Given this, the state adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be 0 (the starting value for the loop counter).
- `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 0**
