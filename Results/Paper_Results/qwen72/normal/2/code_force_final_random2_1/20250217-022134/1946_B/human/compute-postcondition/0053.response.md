The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the first element in `a`, and `a` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements. The value of `x` will now be the second element in `a`.

State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0, `x` is the second element in `a`, `tmp` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0.**
