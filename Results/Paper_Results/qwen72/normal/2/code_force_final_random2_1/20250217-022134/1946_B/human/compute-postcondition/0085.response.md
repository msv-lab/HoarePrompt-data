Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(2^(k-1) * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`, `i` is `k-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, assigning this list to `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, which is now updated with the actual list of integers.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged and retain their specified properties and values as described in the initial state.
