Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`, `i` is `k-1`, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.
- For each element `x`, `tmp` is incremented by `x`.
- If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
- `t` is updated to be the maximum value between `t` and `tmp`.
- After the loop completes, `t` will hold the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`.
- The final value of `ans` is calculated using the formula `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`, where `s` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
- The other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
