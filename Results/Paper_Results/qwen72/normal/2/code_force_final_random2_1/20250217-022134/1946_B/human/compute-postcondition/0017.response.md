Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the second element in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0.** 

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and the current value of `t`. Since the initial state specifies that if `tmp` < 0, `tmp` is set to 0, and otherwise `tmp` is updated to `tmp + x`, the value of `t` will be the maximum of the updated `tmp` (which could be 0 or `tmp + x`) and the current value of `t`. All other variables remain unchanged.
