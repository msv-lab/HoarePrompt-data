Postcondition: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have at least one element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`, `i` is `k-1`. The current value of `tmp` is less than 0.**
