To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the loop head).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(k - 1)`.
- For the loop to execute, `k - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `k` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` is initialized to `k-1` before the loop starts.
- For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 1.

### Final State:
- `T` remains as an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- `_` remains 2.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, with `k` being greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`, `i` is `k-1`, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`**.
