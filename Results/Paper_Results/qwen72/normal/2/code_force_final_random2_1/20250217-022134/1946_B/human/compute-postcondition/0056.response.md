Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0, `x` is the second element in `a`. If `tmp` (which is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0 plus the second element in `a`) is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.***
