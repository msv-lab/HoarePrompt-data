Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the third element in `a`. If `tmp` < 0, `t` is 0 and `tmp` is 0. Otherwise, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, and `tmp` is updated to `tmp` + `x`.***
