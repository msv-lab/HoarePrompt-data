Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array a and the number of operations, respectively. a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array a. The sum of the values of n and k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. MOD is 1000000007.**
