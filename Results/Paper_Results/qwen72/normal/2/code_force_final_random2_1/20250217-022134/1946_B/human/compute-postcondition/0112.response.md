The code snippet `t *= 2` multiplies the value of `t` by 2. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements.
   - `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
   - `t` is `(2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD`.
   - `i` is `k-2`.
   - `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `t` is multiplied by 2.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Before the code, `t` is `(2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD`.
   - After the code, `t` becomes `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD)`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements.
   - `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
   - `t` is `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD)`.
   - `i` is `k-2`.
   - `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD)`, `i` is `k-2`, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`.**
