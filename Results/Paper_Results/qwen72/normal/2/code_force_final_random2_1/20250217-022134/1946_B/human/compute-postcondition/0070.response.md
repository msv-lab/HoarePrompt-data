The code snippet `ans %= MOD` modifies the value of `ans` by taking the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`. This operation ensures that `ans` is within the range [0, MOD-1].

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` is now `2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD`.
- `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative.
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`.
- `i` is 0.

After executing `ans %= MOD`, the value of `ans` is updated to the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t` % MOD, `i` is 0.**
