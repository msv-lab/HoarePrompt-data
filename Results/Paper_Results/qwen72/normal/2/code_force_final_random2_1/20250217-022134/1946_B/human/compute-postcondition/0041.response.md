Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, with the constraint \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, with the constraint that `k` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
- `t` is initialized to 0 and then updated by the expression `t * (2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `T` is read from the standard input and must be between 1 and 10,000.
   - `_` is set to 0, but it is not used in the given code snippet.
   - `n` and `k` are read from the next line, with `k` being greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the next line.
   - `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.

2. **Variable `t`:**
   - `t` is initialized to 0.
   - The expression `t * (2` is incomplete and does not form a valid operation. This suggests that there might be a missing part of the code or a typo.

3. **Variable `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is not defined in the given initial state or code snippet. This means that the `print(ans)` statement will raise a `NameError` because `ans` is not defined.

### Conclusion:
Given the incomplete and undefined nature of the variable `ans`, the `print(ans)` statement will result in a `NameError`.

Output: **NameError (since `ans` is not defined)**
