Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `_` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) % MOD`; `i` is `k-2`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be the remainder when `t` is divided by `MOD`. This means that `t` is now `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
