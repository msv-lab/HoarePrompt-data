The code snippet `ans += t` updates the value of `ans` by adding the current value of `t` to it. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `ans` was initially defined as `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t) % MOD`.
- `t` is defined as `(t * 2) % MOD`.

The new value of `ans` after executing `ans += t` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t) % MOD + t`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t) % MOD + t`, `i` is 2.**
