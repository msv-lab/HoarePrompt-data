Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `0` and 0, `x` is the second element in `a`, `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp = 0` sets the variable `tmp` to 0.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- Since `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, and `tmp` is now 0, `t` remains 0.
