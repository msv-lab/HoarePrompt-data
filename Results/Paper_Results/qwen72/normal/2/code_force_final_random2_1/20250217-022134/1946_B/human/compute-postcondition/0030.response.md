The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 2.

State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `t % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD`, `i` is 1**
