The value of `t` is multiplied by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a` multiplied by 2, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 0.**
