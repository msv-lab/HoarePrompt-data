Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(t * (2`.**

Explanation:
- The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the next line of standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`.
- The values of `T`, `_`, `a`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
- The values of `n` and `k` are now specific integers read from the input.
