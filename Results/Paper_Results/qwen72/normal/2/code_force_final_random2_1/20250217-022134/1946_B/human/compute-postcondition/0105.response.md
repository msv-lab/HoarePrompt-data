Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`, `i` is `k-1`, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes the variables `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `i`, and `ans`.
- The code snippet updates the value of `ans` to `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is calculated using the existing values of `s` and `t`, and the constant `MOD`.
- The output state reflects the updated value of `ans` while keeping all other variables and their conditions intact.
