Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` will hold the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in the list `a` after the loop completes.
- The variable `tmp` will be the sum of the current subarray being considered during the loop. If this sum becomes negative, `tmp` is reset to 0.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
