Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `beautiful_count` (initially 0), `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list of integers from `case['array']` with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. The value of `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` was already in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is updated to `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` was not in `freq`, `freq` now includes the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with a value of 1, and `beautiful_count` remains 0.**
