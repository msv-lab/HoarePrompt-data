Correctness: **True**

The provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. It iterates through the array, calculates the necessary remainders for each element, and uses a frequency dictionary to count how many times a pair of elements meets the criteria for being a "beautiful" pair. The approach of using modulo operations to find the required remainders and checking against a frequency dictionary is efficient and aligns with the constraints and requirements of the problem. The debug prints also suggest that the program is tracking the necessary values correctly. Therefore, the program is likely to produce the correct output for the given problem description.
