To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `case` and `test_cases`.

1. **`case`**: This variable will be assigned values from `test_cases` during each iteration of the loop. Initially, it doesn't need to be set to any specific value because it will be assigned within the loop.

2. **`test_cases`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element. Given the problem description, `test_cases` should contain `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases` to ensure it contains at least one test case. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a_i`) are part of the test cases and will be processed inside the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, each containing two lines: the first line with three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and the second line with `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `results` is an empty list**.
