Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
- `results` is an empty list.
- For each test case, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, and `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case.
- `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered during the loop.
- `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can form a "beautiful" pair with any previous number in `a` based on the conditions specified in the loop.
- Each key in `freq` is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)`, and its value is the number of times this pair has been encountered.
- The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are the results of the last iteration of the loop.

The `print` statement will output the value of `beautiful_count`, which is the total count of numbers in `a` that can form a "beautiful" pair with any previous number in `a`.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the total count of numbers in a that can form a "beautiful" pair with any previous number in a based on the conditions specified in the loop)**
