Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `beautiful_count` is initialized to 0.**

The code initializes `freq` to an empty dictionary, but does not affect any other variables. Therefore, all other variables retain their initial values.
