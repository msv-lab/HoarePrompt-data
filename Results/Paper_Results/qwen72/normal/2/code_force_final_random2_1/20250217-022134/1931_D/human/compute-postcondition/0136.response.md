Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. For each test case, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `case['array']`, and `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the remainders when an element of `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, and the value is the count of how many times this pair of remainders appears in `a`. The variable `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop execution for each test case.**
