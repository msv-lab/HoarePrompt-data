Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` remains an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered during the loop, `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can form a "beautiful" pair with any previous number in `a` based on the conditions specified in the loop. Each key in `freq` is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)`, and its value is the number of times this pair has been encountered. The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are the results of the last iteration of the loop.**
