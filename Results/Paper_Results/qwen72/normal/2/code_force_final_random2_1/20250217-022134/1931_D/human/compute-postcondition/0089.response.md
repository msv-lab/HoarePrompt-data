Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list of integers from `case['array']` with all its elements processed, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` for each element in `a`, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop execution.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the given range.
- **`test_cases`**: Remains a list of `t` test cases.
- **`results`**: Contains one element, which is the final value of `beautiful_count` after the loop has completed.
- **`n`**: The length of the array `a` as specified in the test case.
- **`x` and `y`**: The values used for modulo operations, as specified in the test case.
- **`a`**: The list of integers from the test case, all of which have been processed by the loop.
- **`freq`**: A dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the remainders of the current number when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. The value is the count of how many times this pair has appeared in the list `a`.
- **`beautiful_count`**: The total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop execution. A "beautiful" pair is defined as a pair of numbers where the first number can be transformed into the second number by adding some integer multiple of `x` and `y` such that the resulting number has the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`. This count is updated based on the frequency of the required remainders in the `freq` dictionary.
