You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, x, and y (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. For each test case, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `case['array']`, and `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the remainders when an element of `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, and the value is the count of how many times this pair of remainders appears in `a`. The variable `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop execution for each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Each element in `results` represents the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the `freq` dictionary for each test case. The `freq` dictionary contains counts of how many times each pair of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` appears in the list `a` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. For each test case, it calculates the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` from the remainders of the numbers in the list `a` when divided by `x` and `y`. It returns a list `results` containing the `beautiful_count` for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Each element in `results` represents the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the `freq` dictionary for each test case. The `freq` dictionary contains counts of how many times each pair of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` appears in the list `a` for each test case.
