The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a test case. Each test case dictionary contains 'params' (a list of three integers: `n`, `x`, and `y`) and 'array' (a list of `n` integers). The function processes each test case to calculate the count of "beautiful" pairs of numbers in the array `a` for each test case. A pair is considered "beautiful" if the difference between the required remainders (`required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`) when a number is divided by `x` and `y` respectively, matches a previously seen pair of remainders. The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the count of "beautiful" pairs for the corresponding test case. The original `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
