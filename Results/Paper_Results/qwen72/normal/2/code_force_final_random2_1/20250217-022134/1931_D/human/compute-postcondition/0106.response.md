Postcondition: ***`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in the dictionary `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is updated to `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains 0.***
