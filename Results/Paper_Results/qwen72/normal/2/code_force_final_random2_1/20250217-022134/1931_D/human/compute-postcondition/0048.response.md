The only object in the loop head is the variable `case`, which is an element from the list `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `test_cases` must still contain at least one more element after the current `case`.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, and `case` was the current test case being processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more test case left in `test_cases`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` still has at least one more element.

State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of the next `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of the next `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of the next `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the next test case, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered during the loop, `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can form a "beautiful" pair with any previous number in `a` based on the conditions specified in the loop. The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are the results of the next iteration of the loop.**
