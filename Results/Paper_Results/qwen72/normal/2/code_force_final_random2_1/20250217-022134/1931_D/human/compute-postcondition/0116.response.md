To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.
   - `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
   - `results` is a list containing two elements: the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the final value of `beautiful_count`.
   - `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have at least two elements.
   - `freq` is a dictionary. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` was not in `freq`, it is now set to 1. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` was already in `freq`, it is incremented by 1.
   - `beautiful_count` remains 0.
   - `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - **`num`**: This is the next element in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers, `num` will be one of these integers.
   - **`mod_x`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. Mathematically, `mod_x = num % x`.
   - **`mod_y`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. Mathematically, `mod_y = num % y`.
   - **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This represents the smallest non-negative integer that, when added to `mod_x`, results in a multiple of `x`.
   - **`required_mod_y`**: This is simply `mod_y`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   Let's assume the following values for the variables:
   - `a = [10, 15, 20]`
   - `x = 3`
   - `y = 4`
   - `num` is the first element of `a`, so `num = 10`.

   Now, calculate the values:
   - `mod_x = 10 % 3 = 1`
   - `mod_y = 10 % 4 = 2`
   - `required_mod_x = (3 - 1) % 3 = 2`
   - `required_mod_y = 2`

   Therefore, the `print` statement will output:
   ```
   Number: 10, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 2, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 2
   ```

5. **General Output:**
   Given the initial state and the calculations, the output will be:
   Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y] (where [num] is the next element in the list `a`, [mod_x] is the remainder when [num] is divided by `x`, [mod_y] is the remainder when [num] is divided by `y`, [required_mod_x] is (x - [mod_x]) % x, and [required_mod_y] is [mod_y])**
