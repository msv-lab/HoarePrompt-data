Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
- `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `beautiful_count` (initially 0).
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`.
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`.
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` is a list of integers from `case['array']` with at least 2 elements.
- `num` is the second element of `a`.
- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
- If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, `freq` now includes the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with a value of 1, and `beautiful_count` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1, and `beautiful_count` is updated to `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`num`**: This is the second element of the list `a`.
2. **`mod_x`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
3. **`mod_y`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
4. **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
5. **`required_mod_y`**: This is the same as `mod_y`.

### Example Calculation:
Assume the following values for the variables:
- `a = [10, 15, 20]`
- `x = 7`
- `y = 3`

Then:
- `num = 15` (the second element of `a`)
- `mod_x = 15 % 7 = 1`
- `mod_y = 15 % 3 = 0`
- `required_mod_x = (7 - 1) % 7 = 6`
- `required_mod_y = 0`

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` as calculated above.

Output: **Number: 15, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 0, required_mod_x: 6, required_mod_y: 0**
