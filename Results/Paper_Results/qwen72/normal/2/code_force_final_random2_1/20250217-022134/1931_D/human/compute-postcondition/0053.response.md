Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `beautiful_count` (which is 0).
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`.
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`.
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` is a list of integers from `case['array']`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement will output the following:

```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

Explanation:
- `n` is the first element of the `params` list in the current test case.
- `x` is the second element of the `params` list in the current test case.
- `y` is the third element of the `params` list in the current test case.
- `a` is the list of integers from the `array` in the current test case.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where [n] is the value of `case['params'][0]`, [x] is the value of `case['params'][1]`, [y] is the value of `case['params'][2]`, and [a] is the list of integers from `case['array']`)**
