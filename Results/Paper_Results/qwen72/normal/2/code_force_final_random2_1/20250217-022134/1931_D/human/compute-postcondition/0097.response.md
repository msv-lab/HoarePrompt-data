Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
- `results` is a list containing two elements: the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the final value of `beautiful_count`.
- `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`.
- `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`.
- `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`.
- `a` is a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.

The `print` statement will output the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` as they are defined in the first test case of `test_cases`.

Let's break down the values:
- `n` is the first element of the `params` list in the first test case.
- `x` is the second element of the `params` list in the first test case.
- `y` is the third element of the `params` list in the first test case.
- `a` is the list of integers from the `array` key in the first test case.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where [n] is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, [x] is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, [y] is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, and [a] is the list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']`)**
