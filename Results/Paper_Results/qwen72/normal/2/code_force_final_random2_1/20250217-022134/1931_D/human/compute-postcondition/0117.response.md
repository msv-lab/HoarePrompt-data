Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have at least two elements, `freq` is a dictionary. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` was not in `freq`, then `freq` now has the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` set to 1. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` was already in `freq`, then `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1. `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**
