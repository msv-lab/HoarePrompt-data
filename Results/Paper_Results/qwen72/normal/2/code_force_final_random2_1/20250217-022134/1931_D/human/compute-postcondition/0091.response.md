Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list of integers from `case['array']` with all its elements processed, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` for each element in `a`, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop execution.**
