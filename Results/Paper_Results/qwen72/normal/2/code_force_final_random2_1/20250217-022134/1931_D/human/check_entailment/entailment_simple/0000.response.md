Reasoning:

The provided solution aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Key Points in the Solution:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries, each containing the parameters and the array for a test case).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the result for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the `params` key and the array `a` from the `array` key.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\) where \(\text{mod}_x\) is the remainder of \(a_i\) when divided by \(x\) and \(\text{mod}_y\) is the remainder of \(a_i\) when divided by \(y\).
   - It also initializes `beautiful_count` to zero, which will store the count of beautiful pairs.

3. **Finding Beautiful Pairs**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates:
     - `mod_x` as `num % x`
     - `mod_y` as `num % y`
     - `required_mod_x` as \((x - \text{mod}_x) \% x\)
     - `required_mod_y` as `\text{mod}_y`
   - It checks if the pair \((\text{required_mod_x}, \text{required_mod_y})\) exists in the `freq` dictionary. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the `freq` dictionary to include the current pair \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\).

4. **Storing Results**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array `a`, it appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

5. **Returning Results**:
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Verification:
- The logic correctly identifies the pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
- The use of the `freq` dictionary ensures efficient counting of pairs without nested loops, making the solution scalable for large inputs.
- The provided example test cases are handled correctly, and the output matches the expected results.

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
