Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have at least one more element, `freq` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `required_mod_x` to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged.
- The dictionary `freq` is updated by incrementing the count of the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` by 1.
