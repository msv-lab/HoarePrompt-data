Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Path Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest string by checking if the next character in the first row is '1' and the corresponding character in the second row is '0'. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the lexicographically smallest string.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     4
     0101
     0000
     ```
     The correct lexicographically smallest string is `00000`, but the program will incorrectly output `01000`.

2. **Incorrect Path Counting**:
   - The program calculates the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string using a simple loop, which does not account for all possible paths.
   - For example, in the case where the grid is:
     ```
     4
     0000
     0000
     ```
     The correct number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string `00000` is `2`, but the program will output `1`.

To ensure correctness, the program needs to:
- Properly simulate the movement of the grasshopper to find the lexicographically smallest string.
- Use dynamic programming or a similar approach to count the number of paths that yield this string.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = [input() for _ in range(2)]
    
    # Initialize the lexicographically smallest string
    s = a[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[0][i] < a[1][i]:
            s += a[0][i]
        else:
            s += a[1][i]
    
    # Count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(2)]
    dp[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[0][i] == s[i]:
            dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1]
        if a[1][i] == s[i]:
            dp[1][i] = dp[0][i-1] + dp[1][i-1]
    
    print(s)
    print(dp[1][n-1])

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the lexicographically smallest string is found and the number of paths that yield this string is correctly counted.
