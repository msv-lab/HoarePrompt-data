To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variable `b` is the loop iterator.
   - The expression `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)` determines the range over which `b` will iterate.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)` contains at least one value.
   - For `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)` to contain at least one value, the upper bound (`min(n, m) + 1`) must be greater than the lower bound (2).

3. **Translate the Condition into State Adjustments:**
   - The condition `min(n, m) + 1 > 2` simplifies to `min(n, m) > 1`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 1.
   - The initial state given is `n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string values, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 1, and `ans` is `n`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- We need to ensure that `min(n, m) > 1` for the loop to execute.
- The variable `b` will start at 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) > 1`, `b` is 2, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n`**
