The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers.

- `n` and `m` were initially strings from the input.
- After the conversion, `n` and `m` are now integers.
- The value of `b` is calculated as `min(n, m) + 1`, which remains unchanged because `n` and `m` are now integers, but their values are the same as before the conversion.
- `t` is still greater than or equal to 2.
- `T` is still 2.
- `ans` is still `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers from the input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.**
