The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning these parts to `n` and `m`. This means `n` and `m` will now hold the values from the input, which are expected to be strings since `input().split()` returns a list of strings.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `T` is 0

After executing the code, `n` and `m` will be updated to the values provided by the input, which are strings. The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are strings from input, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 0**
