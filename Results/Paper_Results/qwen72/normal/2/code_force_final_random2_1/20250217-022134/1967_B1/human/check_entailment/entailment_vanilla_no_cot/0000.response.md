Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` is incorrect. The program incorrectly adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the answer, which does not reflect the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This version correctly checks the condition for each pair `(a, b)` and counts the valid pairs. However, this approach might be too slow for large values of `n` and `m` due to its time complexity of \(O(n \times m)\). For better performance, a more optimized approach would be needed, but the above code is logically correct for the given problem.
