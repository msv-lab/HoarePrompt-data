Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + (n + 2) // 4`, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 1, `b` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value.
- Given that `b` is 2, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` simplifies to `(n + 2) // 4`.
- The value of `ans` is now `ans + (n + 2) // 4`.
- The condition that `min(n, m)` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
- The value of `b` remains 2.
