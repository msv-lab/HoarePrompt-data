To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string values.
- `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `T` is 1.
- `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `b` and the expression `min(n, m) + 1`.
2. **Current State of `b`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.
3. **Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be within the range defined by `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)`. This means `b` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than `min(n, m) + 1`.

### Adjustments:
- **Increment `b`**: Since `b` is currently `min(n, m) + 1`, for the next iteration, `b` should be `min(n, m) + 1 - 1 = min(n, m)`.
- **Check Range**: For the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than `min(n, m) + 1`. Therefore, `b` should be `min(n, m)`.

### Updated State:
- `b` is now `min(n, m)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `T`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string values, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`**
