The function `func` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The output of the function is not specified, so I cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information.

Since the task requires me to describe the functionality of the function, and without specific output details, I can only describe the expected input parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The specific output of the function is not provided, so the functionality cannot be fully described.**
