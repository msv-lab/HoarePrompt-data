You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` based on the formula `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` and prints this value. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes. The final state of the program includes the last values of `n` and `m` read from the input, the variable `b` set to `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` as the total number of test cases, and `T` as `t - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `ans` is incorrect. The line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` does not accurately reflect the condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). According to the problem description, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). However, the program's logic will not correctly count these pairs.

Let's break down the issue:
- For \(b = 1\), the program correctly adds \(n\) to `ans` (since \(1 \leq a \leq n\)).
- For \(b = 2\), the program incorrectly adds \((n + 2) // (2 * 2)\) to `ans`, which is not the correct way to count valid pairs.

A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results.
