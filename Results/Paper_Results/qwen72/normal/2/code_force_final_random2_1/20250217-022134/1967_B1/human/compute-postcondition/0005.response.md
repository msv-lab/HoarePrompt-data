To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)` contains at least one value. This means that `min(n, m) + 1` must be greater than 2.
3. **Simplifying the Condition**: For the loop to execute, `min(n, m) + 1 > 2` must be true. Simplifying this, we get `min(n, m) > 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`n` and `m`**: To ensure the loop executes, at least one of `n` or `m` must be greater than 1.
- **`b`**: The variable `b` will start at 2.

### Final State:
Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string inputs.
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `T` is 0.
- `ans` is equal to `n`.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, the state should be:

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that at least one of them is greater than 1, `b` is 2, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n`**.
