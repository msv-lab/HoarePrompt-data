The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` based on the formula `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` and prints this value. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes. The final state of the program includes the last values of `n` and `m` read from the input, the variable `b` set to `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` as the total number of test cases, and `T` as `t - 1`.
