The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 4, the expression simplifies to `(n + 4) // 16`. The value of `ans` is updated accordingly, while the conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + (n + 4) // 16`, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 3.**
