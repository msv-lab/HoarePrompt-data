To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

### Initial State:
- `ans` is updated to `ans + Σ((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
- `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.
- `min(n, m)` remains the same.
- `t` is 2.
- `T` is 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Summation**:
   - The summation `Σ((n + b) // (b * b))` is computed for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
   - For each value of `b` in this range, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is evaluated and added to `ans`.

2. **Final Value of `b`**:
   - After the summation, `b` is set to `min(n, m) + 1`.

3. **Value of `ans`**:
   - The value of `ans` after the summation is the sum of all the terms `(n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

### Explanation of the Print Statement:
- The `print(ans)` statement will print the final value of `ans` after the summation has been performed.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` which is the sum of the terms `(n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of (n + b) // (b * b) for b from 2 to min(n, m))**
