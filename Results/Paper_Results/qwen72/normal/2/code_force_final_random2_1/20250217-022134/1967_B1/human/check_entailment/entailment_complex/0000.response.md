Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of \( b \) from 2 up to \( \min(n, m) \) and calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using the formula \( \text{ans} = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left( \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right) \). However, this approach is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition that \( a + b \) must be a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

The correct approach should involve checking for each pair \((a, b)\) whether \( a + b \) is divisible by \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The current implementation incorrectly assumes a simpler relationship and does not account for the gcd condition.

Additionally, the initial value of `ans` is set to `n`, which is not justified by the problem statement. The correct initial value should be 0, and the count of valid pairs should be incremented based on the correct condition.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
