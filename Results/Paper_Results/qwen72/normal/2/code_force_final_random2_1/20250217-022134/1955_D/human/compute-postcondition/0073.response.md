Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `nabors` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time, `aa` is now a list of strings from the input, `bb` is now a list of strings from the new input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`.**
