Postcondition: ***`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the execution; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` and `out_aa` are updated to the next pair in the `zip` object. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, and `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. All other variables (`C`, `D`, `E`, `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`) retain their previous values.***
