Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `nabors` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time, `aa` is now a list of strings from the input, `bb` is now a list of strings from the new input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`, `C[in_aa]` is one less than its previous value (if it was greater than 0) and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are updated based on the conditions described, `pairs_in_D` is updated based on the conditions described, and `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, `C[in_aa]` is two less than its original value (if it was greater than 1), `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` remain unchanged, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `fnd` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `C[in_aa]` is one less than its previous value (if it was greater than 0), `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are updated based on the conditions described, `pairs_in_D` is updated accordingly, and `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. Additionally, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. All other conditions from the initial state remain valid: `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the third element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element of `aa[:n - m]`, and the changes to `C`, `D`, `E`, and `pairs_in_D` based on the conditions described in the initial state are still applicable.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
