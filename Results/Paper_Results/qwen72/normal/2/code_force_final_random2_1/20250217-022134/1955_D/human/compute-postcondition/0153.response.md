Postcondition: **`C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in dictionary `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `nabors` is 0, `aa` is now a list of strings generated from the input split by spaces, `bb` is a list of strings generated from the new input split by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in `bb`. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 and `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. Additionally, if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` was 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
