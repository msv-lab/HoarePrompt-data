The code snippet `pairs_in_D -= 1` decrements the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the third element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element of `aa[:n - m]`, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1.**
