Output State: **If `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the execution, `fnd` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. All other variables (`C`, `D`, `E`, `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, `pairs_in_D`) retain their previous values.**
