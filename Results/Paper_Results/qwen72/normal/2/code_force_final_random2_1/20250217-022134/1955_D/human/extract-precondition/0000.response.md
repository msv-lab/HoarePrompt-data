Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the required number of matching elements, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
