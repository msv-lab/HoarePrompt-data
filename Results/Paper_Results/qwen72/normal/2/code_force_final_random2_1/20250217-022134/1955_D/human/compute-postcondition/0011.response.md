Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `aa` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the input split by spaces, `bb` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the new input split by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection (minimum counts) of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` (i.e., the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`), `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` (i.e., the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`), `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.**
