Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. All other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `m`, `in_aa` (next element in `aa[m:]`), `out_aa` (next element in `aa[:n - m]`), `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D`, `E`, `C`) retain their previous values.**
