Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`, `C[in_aa]` is one less than its previous value (if it was greater than 0), `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are updated based on the conditions described, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is updated based on the conditions described, and `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged.**
