Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, and `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, `C[in_aa]` is one less than its previous value (which was greater than 0), and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, then if `E[out_aa]` > 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is one less than its previous value (which was greater than 0), `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `pairs_in_D` is one more than its previous value, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` ≤ 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` ≤ 0, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, and if `D[out_aa]` > 0, then if `E[out_aa]` > 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is one less than its previous value (which was greater than 0), `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `pairs_in_D` is one less than its previous value, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` ≤ 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.***
