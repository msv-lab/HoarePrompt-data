Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]`, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in dictionary `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `nabors` is 0, `aa` is now a list of strings generated from the input split by spaces, `bb` is a list of strings generated from the new input split by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in `bb`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the execution of the code, `fnd` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The state of `aa`, `m`, and `n` remains such that `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` both have at least one fewer element remaining. The variables `in_aa` and `out_aa` are updated to the next elements in their respective slices. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
