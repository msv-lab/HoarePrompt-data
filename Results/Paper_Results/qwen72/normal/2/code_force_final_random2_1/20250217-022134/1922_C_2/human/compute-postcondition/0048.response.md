The only objects in the loop head are the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, and the list `a`. The loop iterates over the elements of `a` using `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`, which means it takes four consecutive elements from the list `a` at each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the list `a` has at least 4 elements: `-1000000000.0`, `c`, `d`, and a fourth element. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `a` after the fourth element, making the list have at least 5 elements.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `w` will be the second element (`c`).
- `x` will be the third element (`d`).
- `y` will be the fourth element.
- `z` will be the fifth element.

State: **The list `a` has at least 5 elements: `-1000000000.0`, `c`, `d`, a fourth element, and a fifth element. The variable `v` is `y - x`. The list `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + v`. `w` is `c`, `x` is `d`, `y` is the fourth element, and `z` is the fifth element.**
