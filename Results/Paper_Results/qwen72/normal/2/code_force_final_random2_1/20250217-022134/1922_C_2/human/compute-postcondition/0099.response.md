To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**: 
   - Initially contains: `-1000000000.0`, followed by the new final values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and ends with `2000000000.0`.
   - Structure: `a = [-1000000000.0, c, d, 2000000000.0]`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - Updated to contain more elements based on the loop's operations.
   - The exact values depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.

3. **Variables `t`, `m`, and `u`**:
   - Updated to their new values returned by the function `r()`.
   - `t` is now `t - 1`.
   - `u` is now `u - 1` and must be a truthy value.

4. **Variables `c` and `d`**:
   - Assigned the values returned by `r()`.
   - `c` is less than `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the values of `c` and `d`**:
   - Since `c` and `d` are returned by `r()` and `c < d`, we need to know their specific values. However, without the exact implementation of `r()`, we can only assume they are valid indices within the list `a`.

2. **Determine the structure of `b`**:
   - `b` is updated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
   - Given `a = [-1000000000.0, c, d, 2000000000.0]`, the differences are:
     - `a[1] - a[0] = c - (-1000000000.0) = c + 1000000000.0`
     - `a[2] - a[1] = d - c`
     - `a[3] - a[2] = 2000000000.0 - d`

3. **Calculate the indices in `b`**:
   - The indices used in the `print` statement are `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.
   - Since `c` and `d` are indices in `a`, and `a` has 4 elements, `c` and `d` must be 1 or 2 (since `c < d`).

4. **Assume specific values for `c` and `d`**:
   - Let's assume `c = 1` and `d = 2` (the smallest valid values).
   - Then, `(d - 1) * 2 = (2 - 1) * 2 = 2` and `(c - 1) * 2 = (1 - 1) * 2 = 0`.

5. **Determine the values in `b` at these indices**:
   - `b[0]` would be the difference between the first and second elements of `a`: `c + 1000000000.0`.
   - `b[2]` would be the difference between the third and fourth elements of `a`: `2000000000.0 - d`.

6. **Calculate the final expression**:
   - `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] = b[2] - b[0] = (2000000000.0 - d) - (c + 1000000000.0)`.
   - Simplifying: `2000000000.0 - d - c - 1000000000.0 = 1000000000.0 - d - c`.

### Final Output:
Given the assumptions and the structure of the lists, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1000000000.0 - d - c (where c and d are the values returned by r() and c < d)**
