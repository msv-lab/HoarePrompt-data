To solve this, let's break down the code and its effects:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The list `a` has at least 4 elements: `-1000000000.0`, `c`, `d`, and a fourth element (not specified).
   - The variable `v` is assigned the value `y - x`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
   ```

   - `b[-2]` refers to the second-to-last element of the list `b`.
   - `b[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `b`.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True` (1), otherwise it evaluates to `1` (since `v ** 0` is `1`).
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True` (1), otherwise it evaluates to `1` (since `v ** 0` is `1`).

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The list `b` is extended by two new elements:
     - The first new element is `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`.
     - The second new element is `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.

4. **Final State**:
   - The list `b` is updated with these two new elements.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged.
   - The variable `v` remains `y - x`.

Output State: **The list `a` has at least 4 elements: `-1000000000.0`, `c`, `d`, and a fourth element. The variable `v` is `y - x`. The list `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` and `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.**
