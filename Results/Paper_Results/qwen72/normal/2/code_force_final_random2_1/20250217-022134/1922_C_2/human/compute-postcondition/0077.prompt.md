Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `a` has `n` elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `c`, `d`, and the remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will have grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements. Each pair of new elements added to `b` is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and whether these differences satisfy certain conditions. The exact values of the new elements in `b` depend on the specific values of `c`, `d`, and the subsequent elements in `a`. The variables `t`, `m`, and `u` are now set to the single value returned by the function `r()`. The function `r()` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The list `a` has `n` elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `c`, `d`, and the remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will have grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements. The variables `t`, `m`, and `u` are now set to the values returned by the function `r()`, and `u` is now `u - 1` which must evaluate to a truthy value. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The list `a` has `n` elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the new values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and the remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will have grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements. The variables `t`, `m`, and `u` are set to the values returned by the function `r()`, and `u` is now `u - 2` which must evaluate to a truthy value. If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The list `a` has `n` elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the new values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and the remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will have grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements. The variables `t`, `m`, and `u` are set to the values returned by the function `r()`, and `u` is now `u - 3` which must evaluate to a truthy value. The new values of `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`. If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
