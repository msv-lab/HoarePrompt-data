Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; and a list of `m` pairs `(x_i, y_i)` where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the queries. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    print(b, 'B')
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is a list with length `n-3` appended to the initial `[0, 0]` and each element in `b` from index 2 onwards is calculated as `b[i] = b[i-2] + (y - x)`, `u` is 0 (falsy), `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()` during the last iteration. If `c` is less than `d`, the condition `c < d` holds true. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the condition `c >= d` holds true.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The list `a` has `n` elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the final values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and the remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will have grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements. The variables `t`, `m`, and `u` are set to the values returned by the function `r()`, and `u` is now `0` (or a falsy value). If the final `c` is less than the final `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The list `a` remains unchanged with its initial values: `-1000000000.0`, followed by the new final values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and ends with `2000000000.0`. The list `b` is updated to contain more elements based on the loop's operations, but the exact values depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. The variables `t`, `m`, and `u` are updated to their new values returned by the function `r()`, and `t` is now `t - u_initial` (where `u_initial` is the initial value of `u`). `u` is now `0` and is no longer a truthy value. `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()` during the last iteration. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
