To solve this, let's break down the given code snippet:

```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `b` is `[0, 0, v, v]`
   - `v` is `y - x`
   - `w` is the first element of `a`
   - `x` is the second element of `a`
   - `y` is the third element of `a`
   - `z` is the fourth element of `a`

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `b[-2]` is the third element of `b`, which is `v`.
   - `b[-1]` is the fourth element of `b`, which is also `v`.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is true, otherwise it evaluates to `1` (since any number to the power of 0 is 1).
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is true, otherwise it evaluates to `1`.

3. **Calculations:**
   - `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`:
     - If `v > x - w` is true, this becomes `v + v = 2v`.
     - If `v > x - w` is false, this becomes `v + 1`.
   - `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`:
     - If `v > z - y` is true, this becomes `v + v = 2v`.
     - If `v > z - y` is false, this becomes `v + 1`.

4. **Appending to `b`:**
   - The new elements appended to `b` are the results of the above calculations.

### Final Calculation:
- Let's assume `v = y - x`.
- `x - w` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`.
- `z - y` is the difference between the fourth and third elements of `a`.

Given that `a` is a sorted list, `x - w` and `z - y` are both positive differences.

- If `v > x - w`:
  - `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w) = v + v = 2v`
- If `v <= x - w`:
  - `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w) = v + 1`

- If `v > z - y`:
  - `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y) = v + v = 2v`
- If `v <= z - y`:
  - `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y) = v + 1`

### Output State:
- If `v > x - w` and `v > z - y`:
  - `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, 2v]`
- If `v > x - w` and `v <= z - y`:
  - `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, v + 1]`
- If `v <= x - w` and `v > z - y`:
  - `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, v + 1, 2v]`
- If `v <= x - w` and `v <= z - y`:
  - `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, v + 1, v + 1]`

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is updated to `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, 2v]` if `v > x - w` and `v > z - y`, `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, v + 1]` if `v > x - w` and `v <= z - y`, `[0, 0, v, v, v + 1, 2v]` if `v <= x - w` and `v > z - y`, `[0, 0, v, v, v + 1, v + 1]` if `v <= x - w` and `v <= z - y`, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is the first element of `a`, `x` is the second element of `a`, `y` is the third element of `a`, `z` is the fourth element of `a`.**
