To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**:
   - Starts with `-1000000000.0`.
   - Followed by the new values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`.
   - Remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - Grows by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.

3. **Variables `t`, `m`, and `u`**:
   - Set to the values returned by the function `r()`.
   - `u` is updated to `u - 2` and must evaluate to a truthy value.

4. **Comparison of `c` and `d`**:
   - If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, then `c < d`.
   - Otherwise, `c >= d`.

### Analysis:
- **List `a`**:
  - The first element is `-1000000000.0`.
  - The next two elements are `c` and `d` from the function `r()`.
  - The rest of the elements are up to `2000000000.0`.

- **List `b`**:
  - Grows by `2 * (n - 3)` elements. This means if `n` is the length of `a`, `b` will have `2 * (n - 3)` additional elements.

- **Variables `t`, `m`, and `u`**:
  - `u` is updated to `u - 2` and must be truthy. This implies `u` was initially greater than 2.

- **Comparison of `c` and `d`**:
  - If `c < d`, then `c` is less than `d`.
  - If `c >= d`, then `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine the indices**:
   - `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` are the indices used to access elements in `b`.
   - Since `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`, they are valid indices.

2. **Access elements in `b`**:
   - `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` are the elements at these indices.

3. **Subtract the elements**:
   - The result of `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` is printed.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the elements at the specified indices in `b`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are the values returned by r(), and b is the list that has grown by 2 * (n - 3) elements)**
