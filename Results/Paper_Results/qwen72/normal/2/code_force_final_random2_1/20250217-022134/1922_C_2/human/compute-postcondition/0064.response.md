Postcondition: ***The list `a` has `n` elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `c`, `d`, and the remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will have grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements. The variables `t`, `m`, and `u` are now set to the values returned by the function `r()`, and `u` is now `u - 1` which must evaluate to a truthy value. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.***
