Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; l_i and r_i are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    c = 0
    for x in l:
        c += x
        p.append(c)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        s = p[b - 1]
        if a - 2 >= 0:
            s -= p[a - 2]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input. For each iteration, if `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the condition is not met and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l` + m - 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`. For each iteration, if `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l` minus the cumulative sum up to the (a-2)-th element in the list `l`. Otherwise, `s` remains the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that has been fully iterated over, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is the length of the list `l` + `m` - 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than the length of the list `l` + `m` - 1 and greater than 0. For each iteration, if `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2` is less than 0, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
