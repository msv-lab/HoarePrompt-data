Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is now `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains as the value of `p[b - 1]`.***
