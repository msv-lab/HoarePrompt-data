The function `func` accepts multiple parameters, but they are not explicitly named in the provided signature. Based on the parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the length of the list `c`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
  - `q`: An integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
  - `c`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
  - `queries`: A list of `q` pairs `(l_i, r_i)`, where each pair represents a query range with 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each query. The exact nature of the result is not specified, but it is typically related to some operation performed on the list `c` within the specified ranges `[l_i, r_i]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the length of a list `n`, the number of queries `q`, a list of integers `c`, and a list of query ranges `queries`. It processes each query and returns a result for each query.**
