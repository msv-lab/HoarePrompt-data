To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. This is because `range(x)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `x-1`, and if `x` is 0, the sequence is empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only state that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `int(input())`. It must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
- `l_i` and `r_i` are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- The sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
