Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is now equal to the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` minus the value at index `a - 2` in the list `p`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, either (b - a + 1 ≤ 1) or (s < 2 * (b - a + 1)).***
