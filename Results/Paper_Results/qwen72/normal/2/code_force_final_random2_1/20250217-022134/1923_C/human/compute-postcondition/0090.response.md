Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`.
- The initial state specifies that `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, which is now updated with the new list of integers.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `_`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged or their conditions are still valid.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than the new value of `_` remains valid as `_` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `_` is not specified, only that it has been incremented.
