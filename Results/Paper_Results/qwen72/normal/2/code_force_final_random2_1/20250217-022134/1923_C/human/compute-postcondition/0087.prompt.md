Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and the total number of iterations (input by the user) must be greater than the new value of `_`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than 0. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l` minus the cumulative sum up to the (a-2)-th element in the list `l`. Otherwise, `s` remains the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 ≤ 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l` + 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l` minus the cumulative sum up to the (a-2)-th element in the list `l`. Otherwise, `s` remains the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the program performs additional operations specific to this condition. Otherwise, the program does not perform these additional operations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is now `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains as the value of `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
