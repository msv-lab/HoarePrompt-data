You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of a specified subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function reads input values for the number of test cases, the length of the list, the list itself, and the queries. It maintains a cumulative sum list to efficiently compute subarray sums. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `p`. This is done correctly using the loop:
     ```python
     c = 0
     for x in l:
         c += x
         p.append(c)
     ```
   - This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray using the prefix sums.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program extracts the indices `a` and `b` and computes the sum of the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b-1]` using the prefix sums:
     ```python
     s = p[b - 1]
     if a - 2 >= 0:
         s -= p[a - 2]
     ```
   - This calculation is correct because it correctly handles the edge case where `a` is 1 (i.e., the subarray starts from the beginning of the array).

3. **Good Subarray Check**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).
   - These conditions are derived from the problem statement:
     - The sum of the subarray must equal the sum of the corresponding elements in the array `b`.
     - Each element in `b` must be different from the corresponding element in `c` and must be greater than 0.
     - Therefore, the minimum possible sum of `b` is `2 * (b - a + 1)` (each element in `b` being at least 1 more than the corresponding element in `c`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints "NO". This is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
