Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers derived from user input.
- `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`.
- `x` is the last integer in the list `l`.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `m` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from user input.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This code snippet does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
