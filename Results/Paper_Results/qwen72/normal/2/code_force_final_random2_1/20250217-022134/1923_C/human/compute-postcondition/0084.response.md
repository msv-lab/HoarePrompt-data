Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from user input.
- `l` is a list of integers derived from user input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `x` is the last integer in the list `l`.
- `_` is incremented by 1 from its last value.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from user input.
- `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is now `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains as the value of `p[b - 1]`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
