Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is the total number of iterations performed, which is the sum of the lengths of all lists `l` plus the total number of queries `m` across all test cases, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` is 0. For each iteration, if `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l` minus the cumulative sum up to the (a-2)-th element in the list `l`. Otherwise, `s` remains the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.**

Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop completes all its iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- The variables `n` and `m` are integers read from user input for each test case, representing the number of elements in the list `l` and the number of queries, respectively.
- The list `l` contains integers derived from user input for each test case.
- The list `p` contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- The variable `c` holds the sum of all integers in the list `l`.
- The variable `x` holds the last integer in the list `l`.
- The variable `_` is the total number of iterations performed, which is the sum of the lengths of all lists `l` plus the total number of queries `m` across all test cases.
- The variables `a` and `b` are integers read from user input for each query.
- The variable `m` is 0, as it represents the remaining number of queries, which is exhausted after all iterations.
- For each query, if `a - 2 >= 0`, the variable `s` is calculated as the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l` minus the cumulative sum up to the (a-2)-th element in the list `l`. Otherwise, `s` is the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l`.
- If the length of the subarray defined by `a` and `b` is greater than 1 and the sum `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
