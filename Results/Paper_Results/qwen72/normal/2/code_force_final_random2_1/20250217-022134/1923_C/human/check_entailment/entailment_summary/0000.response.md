Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining if a subarray is "good" based on the criteria outlined in the problem statement. The key logic involves checking if the sum of elements in a subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray, which would allow for the construction of another array `b` that meets the conditions specified.

1. **Cumulative Sum Array**: The program constructs a cumulative sum array `p` to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. This is a common technique to optimize subarray sum calculations.
2. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray using the cumulative sum array. It then checks if the subarray length is greater than 1 and if the subarray sum is at least twice the length of the subarray. This ensures that there is enough "slack" to construct the array `b` with different but positive values.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when the subarray length is 1, where it always prints 'NO' because it's impossible to construct a different array `b` with the same sum and all positive values.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
