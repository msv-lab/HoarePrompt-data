Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that has been fully iterated over, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is the length of the list `l` minus 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than the length of the list `l` minus 1.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains within the specified range.
- The variables `n` and `m` retain their initial values.
- The list `l` has been fully processed.
- The list `p` contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- The variable `c` holds the total sum of all elements in `l`.
- The variable `x` holds the last element of the list `l`.
- The variable `_` is incremented to the length of the list `l` minus 1.
- The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- The condition `m > _` must still hold, meaning `m` must be greater than the length of the list `l` minus 1.
