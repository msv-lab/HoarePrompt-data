Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, `x` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `y` is the new input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, `num` is 1, `count` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and `T` must be greater than the current value of `_`.**
