The function `func` reads and processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of the number of sides of a polygon (`n`), the number of vertices chosen by Bessie (`x`), and a placeholder value (`y`). It also reads a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function calculates and prints the number of additional vertices that can be chosen such that no two chosen vertices are adjacent. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value. The final state includes the printed results for each test case, and the input variables `t`, `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `list0` reflect the last processed test case.
