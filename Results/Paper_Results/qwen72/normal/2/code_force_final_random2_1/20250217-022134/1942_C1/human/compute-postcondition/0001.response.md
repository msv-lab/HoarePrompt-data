The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, indicating that the specific value of the iteration counter is not important. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer equal to 0, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`**
