The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The function returns either 1 (Case_1) or the total number of times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from the original string `s` (Case_2).

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns 1 if the substring 'pie' is not found. If 'pie' is found, it returns the total number of times 'pie' was found and removed from the string `s`.**
