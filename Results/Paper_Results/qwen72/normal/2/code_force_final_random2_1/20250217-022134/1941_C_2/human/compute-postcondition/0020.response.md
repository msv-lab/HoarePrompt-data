The only variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of the substring 'pie' in `s`. If `s` contains the substring 'pie', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` does not contain the substring 'pie'. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must now contain at least one occurrence of the substring 'pie'.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, no longer contains the substring 'map', and now contains at least one occurrence of the substring 'pie'**
