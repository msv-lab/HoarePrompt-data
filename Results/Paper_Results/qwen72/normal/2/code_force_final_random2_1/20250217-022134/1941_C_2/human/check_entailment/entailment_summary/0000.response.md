Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate the substrings "map" and "pie". The function `func_1` iterates through the string, removing instances of these substrings and counting the number of removals. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Special Case Handling**: The special case where the string is exactly "mapie" is handled by returning 1 immediately. This is unnecessary because the general logic of the function should handle this case correctly without needing a special condition.

2. **Substring Removal Logic**: The function removes only two characters when it finds "map" or "pie". This is incorrect because both "map" and "pie" are three-character substrings, and removing only two characters might leave part of the substring intact, which could lead to incorrect results.

3. **Efficiency**: The current approach of repeatedly using `find` and slicing the string can be inefficient, especially for large strings. However, this is more of an optimization issue rather than a correctness issue.

Given these points, the function as written will not always produce the correct result. For example, if the string is "mapie", the function will incorrectly return 1 instead of 2, because it only removes two characters at a time.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
