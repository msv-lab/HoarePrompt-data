### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - Each test case is processed by calling the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads the input for each test case and unpacks it into variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.

3. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints "draw" and returns. This is correct because if Bob's chip is already in or above Alice's chip, Alice cannot win as she cannot move up.

4. **Odd and Even Differences**:
   - The program differentiates between the cases where `(x2 - x1) % 2` is odd or even.
   - **Odd Case**:
     - If `y1 == y2`, Alice wins immediately because she can move directly to Bob's position.
     - If `y2 > y1`, Alice moves diagonally down-right; otherwise, she moves diagonally down-left.
     - The program then checks if Alice can move to Bob's position after these moves.
     - If not, it calculates the remaining distance and checks if Alice can force a win.
   - **Even Case**:
     - If `y1 == y2`, Bob wins immediately because he can move directly to Alice's position.
     - Similar to the odd case, the program calculates the remaining distance and checks if Bob can force a win.

5. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program ensures that the chips do not move out of the board boundaries by checking `1 <= y1 <= m` and `1 <= x1 <= n`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the calculated outcomes.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly. It follows the rules of the game and makes logical decisions based on the positions of the chips and the parity of the differences in their positions.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
