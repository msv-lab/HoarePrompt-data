Given the initial state and the provided conditions, let's break down the scenario step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print('bob')` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: The absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`.
2. **`n`**: The first element of the list `r`.
3. **`m`**: The second element of the list `r`.
4. **`x1`**: `x_a + a`.
5. **`y1`**: Either 1 or `m`.
6. **`x2`**: `r[4] - a`.
7. **`y2`**: Either `r[5] - a` or `r[5] + a`.
8. **`r`**: A list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.
9. **`x2` is greater than `x1`**.
10. **The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even**.
11. **`y1` is not equal to `y2`**.
12. **`b`**: `x2 - x1`.
13. **`x2` is greater than `x1`**.
14. **`x1` is greater than or equal to 1**.
15. **`x2` is less than or equal to `n`**.
16. **If `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, then:**
   - `y1` is set to 1.
   - `y2` is set to `r[5] - a`.
   - `c` is set to `r[5] - a - 1`.
17. **Otherwise:**
   - `y1` is set to `m`.
   - `y2` is set to `r[5] + a`.
   - `c` is set to `m - y2`.
18. **`b // 2` is greater than `a`**.
19. **The absolute value of the difference between `x2` and `c` is greater than or equal to `x1 + c`**.
20. **`y1` is between 1 and `m` inclusive**.
21. **`x1` is between 1 and `n` inclusive**.

### Analysis:
- The `print('bob')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'bob'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('bob')` statement will print the string `'bob'`.

Output: **bob**
