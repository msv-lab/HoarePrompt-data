Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, and `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`. The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. Since `y1 >= y2`, `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.**
