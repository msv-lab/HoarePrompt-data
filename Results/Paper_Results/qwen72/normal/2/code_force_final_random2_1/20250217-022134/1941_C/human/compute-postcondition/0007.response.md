The variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of the substring 'map' within `s`. If `s.find('map')` returns a value other than `-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` no longer contains the substring 'map'. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain the substring 'map'.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and contains the substring 'map', and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; `ans` is 1**
