Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, no longer contains the substring 'map', and does not contain the substring 'pie'; `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from the original string `s`.**

### Explanation:
- **`s`**: After all iterations of the loop, the string `s` will no longer contain the substring 'pie'. The loop continues to remove occurrences of 'pie' until none are left. The string may still contain other characters and substrings, but 'pie' will be completely removed.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` keeps track of how many times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from the original string `s`. After the loop finishes, `ans` will hold the total count of these removals.
