Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` fails to correctly handle cases where the substrings "map" and "pie" overlap or where they appear in different orders. For example, consider the string "mapie":

- The program will first find and remove "map" from "mapie", resulting in "ie".
- It will then check for "pie" and not find it, returning 1.

However, the correct answer should be 2, because we need to remove both 'm' and 'p' to make the string "aie" beautiful. This shows that the program does not always remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
