Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed fails to handle overlapping or differently ordered occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks for and removes "map" and "pie" sequentially without considering the possibility that removing one might affect the other. For instance, in the string "mapie":

1. The program finds and removes "map", resulting in "ie".
2. It then checks for "pie" and does not find it, returning 1.

However, the correct approach would be to remove both 'm' and 'p' to make the string "aie" beautiful, which requires 2 deletions. This demonstrates that the program does not always compute the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful.

Additionally, the special case handling for the string "mapie" with `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is insufficient and does not cover all possible overlapping scenarios.

Final: **False**
