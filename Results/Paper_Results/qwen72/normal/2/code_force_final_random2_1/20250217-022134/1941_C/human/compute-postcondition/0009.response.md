Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and contains the substring 'ap' (with the first 'm' removed from the first occurrence of 'map'), and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; `ans` is 2**. 

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. The string `s` remains unchanged, maintaining its properties as described in the initial state.
