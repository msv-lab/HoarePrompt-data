Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen for excursions, given the constraints and conditions described. Let's break down the logic and verify if it matches the requirements:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `sum_f` to 0, which will store the sum of initial friendship values.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values**:
   - For each of the `m` pairs, it reads `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` and adds `f_i` to `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - It calculates `cn2` as the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` (i.e., `n * (n - 1) // 2`).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the expected value is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the initial friendship values and the increase in friendship values over the excursions.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` to simplify the fraction.
   - It then divides both `p` and `q` by their GCD.

6. **Modular Inverse and Final Output**:
   - The program computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It multiplies `p` by the modular inverse of `q` and takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - Finally, it prints the result.

### Verification of the Formula
The formula used in the program is derived from the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values. The term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f}\) accounts for the initial friendship values, and the term \(m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\) accounts for the increase in friendship values over the excursions. The denominator \(2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2\) normalizes the expected value.

### Edge Cases
- The program handles the case where `m` is 0 (no friends) correctly, as the expected value would be 0.
- The program also handles large values of `n`, `m`, and `k` within the given constraints.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used is appropriate, and the steps taken to compute the expected value and handle modular arithmetic are correct.

Correctness: **True**
