The code snippet `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the value of `f` to its current value. Given that `sum_f` is initially `f`, after the execution of the code, `sum_f` will be `f + f`, which simplifies to `2 * f`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `2 * f`, `j` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**
