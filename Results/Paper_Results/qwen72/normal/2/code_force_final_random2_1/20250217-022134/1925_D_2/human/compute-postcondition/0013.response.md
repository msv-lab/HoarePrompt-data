Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `3 * f`, `j` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by `f`. Initially, `sum_f` is `2 * f`. After executing the code, `sum_f` becomes `2 * f + f`, which simplifies to `3 * f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
