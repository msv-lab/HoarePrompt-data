Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` pairs `(a_i, b_i, f_i)`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these inputs and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the pairs `(a_i, b_i, f_i)`. It computes a result using these values and prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
