Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is the last input integer for `n`, `m` is the last input integer for `m`, `k` is the last input integer for `k`, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is the last input integer for `a`, `b` is the last input integer for `b`, `f` is the last input integer for `f`, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be decremented to 0 because the loop runs `t` times.
- **`i` is `t`**: The loop variable `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop completes, which means it will be 0 since `t` is 0.
- **`n`, `m`, `k`**: These variables will hold the values of the last test case processed by the loop.
- **`sum_f`**: This variable will hold the sum of all `f` values input during the last iteration of the loop.
- **`j` is `m - 1`**: The inner loop variable `j` will be `m - 1` after the inner loop completes, as it iterates from 0 to `m - 1`.
- **`a`, `b`, `f`**: These variables will hold the last values input during the last iteration of the inner loop.
- **`cn2`**: This variable will hold the value of `n * (n - 1) // 2` for the last test case.
- **`p` and `q`**: These variables will hold the final values of the numerator and denominator of the fraction used to compute the result, respectively, after simplification by their greatest common divisor `gcd`.
- **`gcd`**: This variable will hold the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` for the last test case.
