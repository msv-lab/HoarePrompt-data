The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. This operation updates the values of these variables, replacing their previous values with the new inputs.

- `a` is updated to the first integer input.
- `b` is updated to the second integer input.
- `f` is updated to the third integer input.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `j` is `m + 1`, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `f` is the third integer input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * 0 + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**.
