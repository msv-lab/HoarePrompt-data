### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions.
   - Each excursion involves selecting a pair of children, and if they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` (number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions).
   - It then reads the friendship values for each pair of friends and sums them up in `sum_f`.
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is calculated as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - Finally, it computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) and prints the result.

3. **Mathematical Derivation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions can be derived as follows:
     - The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in one excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
     - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair of friends in one excursion is \(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
     - Over `k` excursions, the expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair of friends is \(k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
     - The total expected increase in the friendship value for all pairs of friends is \(k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot m\).
     - The initial sum of friendship values is `sum_f`.
     - Therefore, the total expected value is \(k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot m + k \cdot \text{sum\_f}\).

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of pairs `cn2`.
   - It correctly calculates the sum of initial friendship values `sum_f`.
   - It correctly calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - It correctly simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their gcd.
   - It correctly computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are no pairs of friends (`m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value is 0.
   - The program handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the expected value is the sum of the initial friendship value plus the increase over `k` excursions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation for solving the given problem.
