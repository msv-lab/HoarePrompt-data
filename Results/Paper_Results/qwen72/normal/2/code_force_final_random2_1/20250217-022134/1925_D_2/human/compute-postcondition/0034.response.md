Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `m * f`, `j` is `m-1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `m` times, and in each iteration, it reads three integers (`a`, `b`, `f`) from the input and adds `f` to `sum_f`.
- After `m` iterations, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values read during the loop, which is `m * f` if each `f` value is the same.
- The variable `j` starts at `m-1` and is not modified within the loop, so it remains `m-1` after the loop completes.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) are either not modified by the loop or their values are determined based on the final value of `sum_f` and the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
