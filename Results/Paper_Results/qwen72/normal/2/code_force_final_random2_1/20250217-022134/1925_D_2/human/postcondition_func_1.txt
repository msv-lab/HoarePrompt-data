The function `func_2` processes a series of test cases, each defined by inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of `m` friendship relationships. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the friendship data. It calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and all results have been printed.
