The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` pairs `(a_i, b_i, f_i)`. The constraints are as follows: `1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4` for the number of test cases, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` for the number of nodes, `0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)` for the number of edges, and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5` for a specific parameter `k`. For each pair, `a_i ≠ b_i`, `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` pairs `(a_i, b_i, f_i)`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs and constraints.**
