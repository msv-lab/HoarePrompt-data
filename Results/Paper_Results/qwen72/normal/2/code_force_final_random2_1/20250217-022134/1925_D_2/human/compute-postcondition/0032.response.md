The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. This operation updates the values of these variables, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `j` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
