Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `n == k` Case**: While the program correctly identifies when `n == k`, it only prints a single stall with a price of 1. However, it should be able to handle this case more flexibly, especially since the problem allows for up to 60 stalls.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Setting Up Stalls**: The logic used to set up the stalls and their prices is flawed. The program attempts to use a fixed approach with only two stalls (`costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`), which is not sufficient to handle all cases. For example, it doesn't consider the possibility of using more than two stalls to achieve the desired number of jewels.

3. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program prints "YES" and the number of stalls before printing the actual stall prices, which is not in the correct order as specified in the problem statement. The correct order should be:
   - "YES"
   - Number of stalls
   - Prices of the stalls

4. **Handling of `h < k` Condition**: The variable `h` is used to track the number of jewels Alice buys, but the logic to update `h` and `n` is incorrect. The program should ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and the current logic does not guarantee this.

5. **General Approach**: The program's approach to setting up the stalls is too simplistic and does not account for the flexibility allowed by the problem constraints (up to 60 stalls and prices up to \(10^{18}\)).

To fix these issues, a more robust approach is needed, such as dynamically setting up the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels while adhering to the constraints. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        continue
    
    # If n >= k, we can always set up k stalls with prices 1, 1, ..., 1
    # and one additional stall with a high price to ensure Alice stops buying after k jewels.
    print("YES")
    print(k + 1)
    prices = [1] * k + [n - k + 1]
    print(*prices)
```

This corrected program ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up `k` stalls with a price of 1 each and one additional stall with a price of `n - k + 1` to stop Alice from buying more jewels. This approach is simple and guarantees the correct output for all valid inputs.
