Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is less than `k`.
- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`.
- `h` is the sum of the initial value of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
- `curr` is 0.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `n`:**
   - `n` is 0.

2. **List `costs`:**
   - `costs = [1 - k, 1]`.

3. **Calculation of `h`:**
   - `h` is the sum of the initial value of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
   - Since `n` is 0, `n / (1 - k) = 0` and `n / 1 = 0`.
   - Therefore, `h = 0 + 0 = 0`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The initial state specifies that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - However, from the calculation, `h` is 0, which contradicts the condition that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given this contradiction, it seems there might be an error in the initial state description. However, if we assume the initial state is correct and `h` is indeed greater than or equal to `k`, then the `print` statement will execute as follows:

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
