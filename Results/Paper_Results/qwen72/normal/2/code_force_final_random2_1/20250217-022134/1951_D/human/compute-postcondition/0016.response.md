The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `costs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `costs`. The loop iterates over each element in `costs`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the next element in `costs`, which is the second element, `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the second element of `costs`.

State: **`n` is now `n - i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `curr`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is 1**
