Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

The code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This code snippet does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
