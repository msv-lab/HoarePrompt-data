Output State: **`n` is now `n - i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * n`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is 1, and `n` is updated to `n - i * (n // i)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - i * curr`.
- Since `i` is 1 and `curr` is `n // i`, the expression `i * curr` simplifies to `1 * (n // 1)`, which is `n // 1` or simply `n`.
- Therefore, `n` is updated to `n - n`, which results in `n` being 0.
- All other variables (`k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The initial condition that `n` is not equal to `k` and `n` is greater than or equal to `k` remains valid, but `n` is now 0.
- The list `costs` remains `[n - k + 1, 1]`, but since `n` is now 0, the first element of `costs` is `0 - k + 1` or `-k + 1`.
- `h` is still `2 * n`, but since `n` is now 0, `h` is also 0.
- `curr` is still `n // i`, but since `n` is now 0, `curr` is 0.
- `i` remains 1.

Thus, the final output state is:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[-k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is 0.
- `curr` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
