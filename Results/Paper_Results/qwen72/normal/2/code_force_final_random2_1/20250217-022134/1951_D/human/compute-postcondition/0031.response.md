Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is less than `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`, `h` is the sum of the initial value of `n` divided by each element in `costs`, and `curr` is 0. If `h` is less than `k`, the program follows the logic for the if part. If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program follows the logic for the else part.***
