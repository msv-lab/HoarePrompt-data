The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case in the list `t` is a tuple containing an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "U" and "D". The function processes each test case and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `t` of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". It returns a list of results for each test case.**
