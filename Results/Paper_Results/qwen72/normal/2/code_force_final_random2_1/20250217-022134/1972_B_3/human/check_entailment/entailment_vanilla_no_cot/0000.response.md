Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem based on the given description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list. It then processes each test case using the values from this list.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' (facing-up coins) in the string `s`.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd (`num_up % 2 == 1`), Alice will win because she can always make the first move and force Bob into a losing position.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win because Alice will eventually be forced into a position where she cannot make a move.

3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if Alice wins and "NO" otherwise, which matches the required output format.

Given these points, the program is logically correct and should work as expected for the given problem.
