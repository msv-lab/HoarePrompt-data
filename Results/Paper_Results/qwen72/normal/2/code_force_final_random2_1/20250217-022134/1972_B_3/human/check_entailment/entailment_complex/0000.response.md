Reasoning:

The problem involves a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The key to determining the winner lies in the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ("U") at the start of the game. Here's why:

1. **Game Mechanics and Parity**:
   - Each move involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - Flipping a coin changes its state from "U" to "D" or vice versa.
   - The game ends when no facing-up coins are left, and the player whose turn it is loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that an odd number of facing-up coins remains after her turn. This means Bob will always face an even number of facing-up coins, and eventually, Bob will be forced to lose when no facing-up coins are left.
   - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always ensure that an even number of facing-up coins remains after his turn, forcing Alice to eventually lose.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`.
   - It returns "YES" if the count of "U" characters is odd, indicating Alice will win.
   - It returns "NO" if the count of "U" characters is even, indicating Bob will win.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when there are no facing-up coins (count of "U" is 0, which is even, so Bob wins).
   - It also handles the case where there is only one coin (if it is "U", Alice wins; if it is "D", Bob wins).

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

Correctness: **True**
