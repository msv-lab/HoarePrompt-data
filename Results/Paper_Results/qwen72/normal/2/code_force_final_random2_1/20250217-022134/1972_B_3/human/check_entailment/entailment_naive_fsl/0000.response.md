Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s`. According to the game rules, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make the first move and force Bob into a losing position. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win because Alice will eventually be forced into a position where she cannot make a valid move. This logic aligns with the provided examples and the problem's constraints. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
