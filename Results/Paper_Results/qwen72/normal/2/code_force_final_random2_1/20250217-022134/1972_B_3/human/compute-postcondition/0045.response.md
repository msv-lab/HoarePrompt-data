Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, processes a series of test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd. If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in the results list. The final state of the program is that `t` (the number of test cases) is 0, `index` is `1 + 2 * t_initial` (where `t_initial` is the initial number of test cases), and `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, with exactly `t_initial` elements. **
