The function `func_2` takes a list `case` as its parameter, where `case[0]` is an integer indicating the number of coins (1 ≤ `case[0]` ≤ 100), and `case[1]` is a string of the same length as the number of coins, consisting of 'U' (up) and 'D' (down). The function returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string is even, and 'NO' if the number of 'U' characters is odd. The function does not modify the input `case`.
