Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of up to 1000 test cases, where each test case involves a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each test case, the function checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. If the string contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' followed by either the string `s` sorted in descending order (if `s` is already sorted in ascending order) or the string `s` sorted in ascending order (if `s` is not already sorted in ascending order). After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. **
