To determine what will be printed by the `print(b)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input string `s`.
   - `b` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order.
   - `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order.

2. **Focus on `b`:**
   - `b` is defined as a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `s = "dcba"`.
   - The unique characters in `s` are `{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}`.
   - Sorting these characters in ascending order gives the string `"abcd"`.

Therefore, the `print(b)` statement will print the characters of the string `s` sorted in ascending order.

Output: **b (where b is the string containing the characters of s sorted in ascending order)**

For example, if `s = "dcba"`, then the output will be:
Output: **"abcd"**
