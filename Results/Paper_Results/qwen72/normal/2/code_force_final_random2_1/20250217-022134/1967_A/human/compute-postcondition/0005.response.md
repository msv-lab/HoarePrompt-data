Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `r` is the smallest element in `a`, `rem` is 0.** 

The variable `rem` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `rem` with a value of 0.
