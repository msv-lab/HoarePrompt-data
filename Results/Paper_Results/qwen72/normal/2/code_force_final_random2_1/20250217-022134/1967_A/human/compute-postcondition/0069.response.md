Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is the second element of `a` plus `k // 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is the third element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.***
