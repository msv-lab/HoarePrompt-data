### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - We start with a given set of cards and can buy up to `k` additional cards.
   - The goal is to rearrange the cards to form as many valid subarrays as possible.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the initial counts of each card type.
   - The counts are sorted to facilitate the calculation of how many additional cards are needed to balance the counts.
   - The program iterates through the sorted counts to determine the minimum number of additional cards required to make the counts as balanced as possible.
   - If the available coins (`k`) are sufficient to balance the counts up to a certain point, it updates the remaining coins and the current minimum count.
   - If the coins run out before balancing all counts, it calculates the maximum score based on the partially balanced counts.
   - If there are still coins left after the loop, it calculates the maximum score using the remaining coins.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `r` is initialized to the smallest count in the sorted list.
     - `rem` is used to store the remainder of the division when distributing coins.
     - `y` is used to store the number of elements that are not fully balanced.
   - **Balancing Counts:**
     - The program iterates through the sorted counts and checks if the required number of additional cards exceeds the available coins.
     - If the required number of additional cards exceeds the available coins, it updates `r`, `rem`, and `y` and breaks the loop.
     - If the required number of additional cards is within the available coins, it updates the remaining coins and the current minimum count.
   - **Final Calculation:**
     - If there are still coins left after the loop, it calculates the maximum score using the remaining coins.
     - If the coins are exhausted, it calculates the maximum score based on the partially balanced counts.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and the main logic.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
