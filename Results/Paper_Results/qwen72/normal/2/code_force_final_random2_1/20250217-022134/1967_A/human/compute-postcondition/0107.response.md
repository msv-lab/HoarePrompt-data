The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, the new value of `y` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is `int(input())`, `k` is the second integer from the input split minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[1] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 2`.**
