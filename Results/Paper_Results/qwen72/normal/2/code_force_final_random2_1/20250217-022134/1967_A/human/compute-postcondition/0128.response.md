Postcondition: ***`a` remains a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is the first integer from the input split, `k` is either 0 or the remaining value after all subtractions. If `k` is not 0, `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n` and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` where `i` is the last index before breaking or completing the loop, and `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is the last index before breaking or completing the loop. If `k` is 0, `r` remains the last value of `a` that was updated, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is the last index before breaking or completing the loop.***
