Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n-2`.
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1.
3. `k` is a non-zero integer.
4. `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
5. `rem` is `k % (n-1)` if the condition `(n-2 + 1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]) > k` was met, otherwise `rem` is 0.
6. `y` is 1 if the condition was met, otherwise `y` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `r`:**
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Determine `rem` and `y`:**
   - `rem` and `y` depend on the condition `(n-2 + 1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]) > k`.
   - Simplify the condition: `(n-1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]) > k`.
   - If this condition is true, `rem` is `k % (n-1)` and `y` is 1.
   - If this condition is false, `rem` is 0 and `y` is 0.

3. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression to print is `(r - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Substitute `r` with `a[n - 1] + k // n`:
     \[
     (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 = (a[n - 1] * n + (k // n) * n - n) + 1 = a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1
     \]

### Final Output:
The final output depends on the values of `a[n - 1]`, `k`, and `n`. However, the expression simplifies to:
\[
a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1
\]

Since the exact values of `a[n - 1]`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the list a, k is a non-zero integer, and n is an integer greater than 1)**
