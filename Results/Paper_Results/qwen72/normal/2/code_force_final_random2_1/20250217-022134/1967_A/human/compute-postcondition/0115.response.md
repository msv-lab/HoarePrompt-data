Output State: **If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `k` is the second integer from the input split minus `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rem` is updated to `k % (i + 1)`.
- All other variables (`k`, `r`, `y`) retain their values as specified in the initial state.
- The condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` determines the initial values of `k`, `r`, and `y`, but does not affect the calculation of `rem`.
