The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the new value of `y` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `r` is the second element of the sorted list `a` plus `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.**
