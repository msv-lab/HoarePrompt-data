Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is `int(input())`, `k` is the second integer from the input split minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[1] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `rem = k % (i + 1)` updates the value of `rem` to be the remainder when `k` is divided by `(i + 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The value of `rem` is now `k % (i + 1)`.
