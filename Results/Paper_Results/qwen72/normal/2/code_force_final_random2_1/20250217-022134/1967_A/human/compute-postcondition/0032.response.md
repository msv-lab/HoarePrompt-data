Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of the variables `i`, `n`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
