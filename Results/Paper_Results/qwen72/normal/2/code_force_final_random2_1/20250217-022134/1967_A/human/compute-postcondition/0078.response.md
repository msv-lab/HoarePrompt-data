Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, and `y` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is `a[3]`.***
