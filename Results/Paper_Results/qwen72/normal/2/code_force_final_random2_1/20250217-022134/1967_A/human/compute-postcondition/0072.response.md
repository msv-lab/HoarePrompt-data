Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `rem` is calculated as `k % (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `k % 3`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `r`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
