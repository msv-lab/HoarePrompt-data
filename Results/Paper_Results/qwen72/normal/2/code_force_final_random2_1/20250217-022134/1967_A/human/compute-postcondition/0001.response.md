The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`, converting both to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
- `ii` is 0
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, which are both integers and greater than 0.
- The values of `t` and `ii` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0.**
