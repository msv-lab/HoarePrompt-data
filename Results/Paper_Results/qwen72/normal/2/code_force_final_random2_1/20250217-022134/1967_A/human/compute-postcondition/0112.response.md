Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is `int(input())`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[1] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `k` is the second integer from the input split minus `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2]`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.***
