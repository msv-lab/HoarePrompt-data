Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is `int(input())`. If `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is the second integer from the input split minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is now `a[1]`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.***
