Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `r` is the second element of the sorted list `a` plus `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is set to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `r` is still the second element of the sorted list `a` plus `k` (which is now 0) divided by 2 (integer division). The value of `rem` is still `k % 2`, which is now 0 because `k` is 0. The value of `y` remains `n - 2`. The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers from user input.
