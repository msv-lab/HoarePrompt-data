Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of card types (`n`), the number of coins available (`k`), and a list of the initial number of cards of each type (`a`). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be achieved by distributing the available coins among the card types. The function modifies the input list `a` by sorting it but does not alter the original values. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. **
