Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is `a[3]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to be the fourth element of the list `a` (since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3, and list indexing starts at 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
