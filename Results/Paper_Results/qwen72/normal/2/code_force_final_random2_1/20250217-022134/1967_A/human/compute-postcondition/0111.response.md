Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is `int(input())`, `k` is the second integer from the input split minus `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to `a[2]` because `i` is 1, and `a[i + 1]` refers to `a[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
