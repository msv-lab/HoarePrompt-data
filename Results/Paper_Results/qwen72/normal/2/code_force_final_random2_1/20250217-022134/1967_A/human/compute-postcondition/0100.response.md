Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input split, `r` is now `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is `int(input())` (assuming `int(input())` is the next integer greater than the current `ii` for the loop to execute again), and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.***
