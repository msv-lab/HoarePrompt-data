Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `n - 1 - 1`, which is `n - 2`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, and `rem`) remain unchanged.
