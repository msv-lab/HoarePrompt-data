Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is the third element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers from user input.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- The value of `r` remains the third element of `a`.
- The value of `rem` remains 0.
- The value of `y` remains 0.
