Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `n` is the first integer from the input split.
- `k` is either 0 or the remaining value after all subtractions, but currently `k` is not 0.
- `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, where `i` is the last index before breaking or completing the loop.
- `y` is `n - 1 - i`, where `i` is the last index before breaking or completing the loop.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `r`**:
   - `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Understanding `rem`**:
   - `rem` is the remainder of `k` when divided by `(i + 1)`.
   - `i` is `n-2`, so `i + 1` is `n-1`.

3. **Understanding `y`**:
   - `y` is `n - 1 - i`.
   - Since `i` is `n-2`, `y` is `n - 1 - (n-2) = 1`.

4. **Expression to Print**:
   - The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` needs to be evaluated.
   - `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - Therefore, `(r - 1) * n + 1` becomes `((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1`.

### Simplifying the Expression:
- Let's denote `a[n - 1]` as `last_element`.
- Let's denote `k // n` as `quotient`.
- The expression becomes:
  \[
  ((\text{last\_element} + \text{quotient}) - 1) * n + 1
  \]
  \[
  (\text{last\_element} + \text{quotient} - 1) * n + 1
  \]

### Final Output:
- The final output will be the result of the expression:
  \[
  (\text{last\_element} + \text{quotient} - 1) * n + 1
  \]

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 4`.
- `a[n - 1]` is `4`.
- Suppose `k = 7`.
- `k // n` is `7 // 4 = 1`.
- `r` is `4 + 1 = 5`.
- The expression becomes:
  \[
  (5 - 1) * 4 + 1 = 4 * 4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17
  \]

### General Output:
- The output will depend on the specific values of `a`, `n`, and `k`, but the formula is consistent.

Output: **(\(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1\) * n + 1)**

This is the precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the print statement.
