To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `i` is `n-2`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `r` is the first element of the sorted list `a`
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `ii` is incremented by 1
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(0, n - 1)`.
- For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value. This means `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which implies `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The current state says `i` is `n-2`. However, for the loop to start, `i` should be 0.
- The condition `n > 1` must be true for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `r` is the first element of the sorted list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is incremented by 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.**
