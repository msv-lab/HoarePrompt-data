Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0, and `l` is equal to `r`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.
- The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
