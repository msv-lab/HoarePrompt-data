The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently executing. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, and `a[r] * 2` is not equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
