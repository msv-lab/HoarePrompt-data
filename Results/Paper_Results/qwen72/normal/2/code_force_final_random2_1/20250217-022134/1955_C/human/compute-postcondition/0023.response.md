Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition, `sunks` is 1 or 2 depending on the initial value of `sunks`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[0]`, and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[0]`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `sunks` is 2, and the current value of `a[r]` is 0. Otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1` and `sunks` is 1. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
