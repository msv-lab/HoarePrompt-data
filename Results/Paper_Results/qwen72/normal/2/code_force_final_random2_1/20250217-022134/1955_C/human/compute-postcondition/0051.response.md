Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. Additionally, `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, and the current value of `a[r] * 2` is equal to `k`.** 

Explanation: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3 depending on its initial value (which was 0, 1, or 2). All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
