Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`, `sunks` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, `k` is now `k - a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`. If `l` equals `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` is now `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
