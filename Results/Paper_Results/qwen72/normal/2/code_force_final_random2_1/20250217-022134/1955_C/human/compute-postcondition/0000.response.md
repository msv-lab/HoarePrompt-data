Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.** 

Explanation: The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and `n - 1` respectively. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
