The value of `k` is updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[r]` from it. Since the initial value of `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[r]`, the new value of `k` will be non-negative. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. The new value of `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]` which is non-negative.**
