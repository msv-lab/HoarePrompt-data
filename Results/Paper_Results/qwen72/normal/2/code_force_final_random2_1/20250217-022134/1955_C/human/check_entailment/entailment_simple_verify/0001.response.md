### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` reaches 0, the loop breaks, indicating no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink the single remaining ship. If so, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, it checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink both the first and last ships. If so, it updates `k`, `a[r]`, and `sunks` accordingly. If not, it breaks the loop.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, it performs similar checks and updates.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all ships are sunk correctly.
   - It also handles the case where no ships are sunk correctly.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations confirm that the initial state of the program is correct, with valid inputs and the list `a` being properly initialized.
   - The loop logic is designed to handle the alternating attacks on the first and last ships, and the updates to `k`, `a[l]`, and `a[r]` are consistent with the problem description.
   - The termination conditions for the loop are correctly implemented, ensuring that the loop stops when either `k` is exhausted or there are no more ships to attack.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the problem description. It handles all edge cases and performs the necessary checks to determine the number of sunk ships. The annotations and the code logic align with the expected behavior.

Final: **True**
