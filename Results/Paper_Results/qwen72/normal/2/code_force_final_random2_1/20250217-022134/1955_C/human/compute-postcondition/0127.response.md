Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`, `sunks` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, `k` is `k - (a[r+1] * 2)`, and `a[l]` is `a[l] - a[r+1]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, 2, or 3, and `sunks` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately.**
