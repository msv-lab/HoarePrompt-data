The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables within the scope of this statement. However, the conditions and values set before the `continue` statement remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `l` is 1 or 2.
- `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`.
- `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3.
- `k` is now `k - (a[0] * 2)`.
- `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[0]`.
- If `a[r]` is 0, `sunks` is 2 or 3, and `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
- If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the updates already applied.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3, `k` is now `k - (a[0] * 2)`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[0]`. If `a[r]` is 0, `sunks` is 2 or 3 and `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`. If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
