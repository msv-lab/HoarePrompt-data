The value of `a[l]` is updated by subtracting the value of `a[r]` from it. Since the initial value of `a[r]` is less than the initial value of `a[l]`, the new value of `a[l]` will be the difference between the original value of `a[l]` and the value of `a[r]`.

All other conditions remain unchanged, including the values of `n`, `k`, `a` (except for the updated `a[l]`), `l`, `r`, and `sunks`. The new value of `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]`, which is non-negative.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2, `a[r]` is less than the original value of `a[l]`, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`, and `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]` which is non-negative.**
