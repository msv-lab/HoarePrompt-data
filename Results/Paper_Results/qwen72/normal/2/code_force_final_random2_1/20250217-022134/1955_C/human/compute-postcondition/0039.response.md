The value of `a[l]` is updated by subtracting the value of `a[r]` from it. Since `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, the new value of `a[l]` will be `a[l] - a[r]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2, the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`, the new value of `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]` which is non-negative, and `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`.**
