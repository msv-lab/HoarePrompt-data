Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 1, 2, or 3, `r` is `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, `sunks` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, `k` is now `k - a[r] * 2`, and `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` was initially 0, 1, or 2, it is now 1, 2, or 3.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `sunks`) remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `k` and `a[l]` are updated as described in the initial state.
