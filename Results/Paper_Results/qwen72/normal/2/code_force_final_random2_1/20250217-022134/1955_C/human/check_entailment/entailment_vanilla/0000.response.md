### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of each ship `a`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. It takes three parameters: `n` (number of ships), `k` (number of attacks), and `a` (list of ship durabilities).

3. **Initialization**: The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively. It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.

4. **Main Loop**: The main loop runs as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. This ensures that the loop continues until there are no more ships to attack.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k` becomes 0, the loop breaks because no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. The program checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink this ship. If so, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.

6. **Attack Logic**:
   - If `a[l]` (durability of the leftmost ship) is less than or equal to `a[r]` (durability of the rightmost ship), the program checks if `k` is enough to sink both the leftmost and rightmost ships. If so, it updates `k`, `a[r]`, and `sunks` accordingly.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, the program performs similar checks but for the rightmost ship first.

7. **Break Conditions**:
   - The program includes several break conditions to ensure that the loop terminates when no more attacks can be made or when the remaining attacks are not enough to sink any more ships.

8. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is the number of ships that have sunk.

### Correctness:
After reviewing the logic and structure of the program, it appears to correctly implement the required functionality. The program handles edge cases, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs the correct results for the given examples.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
