Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is 1 or 2, `a[r]` is less than the original value of `a[l]`, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`, and `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]` which is non-negative. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `sunks` is 1, and `a[l]` remains 0.**
