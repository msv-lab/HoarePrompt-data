Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 < `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is set to 2.** 

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition for setting `num` (if `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1; otherwise, `num` is 2) remains valid as specified in the initial state.
