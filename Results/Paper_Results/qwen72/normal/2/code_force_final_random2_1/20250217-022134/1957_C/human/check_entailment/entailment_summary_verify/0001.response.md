### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game where you and a computer take turns placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - The goal is to count the number of different final configurations of the board after all possible moves are made, ensuring no two rooks attack each other.
   - The computer mirrors your moves unless the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), in which case it skips its turn.
   - The final configurations are counted modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Initial Moves:**
   - The initial \( k \) moves are provided, and the computer mirrors these moves.
   - For each move \( (r, c) \):
     - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
     - If \( r \neq c \), the computer places a rook at \( (c, r) \).

3. **Counting Remaining Moves:**
   - The variable `num` counts the number of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - For each move \( (r, c) \):
     - If \( r = c \), it occupies one row and one column.
     - If \( r \neq c \), it occupies two rows and two columns (one for each rook).

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The remaining number of rows and columns available for placing rooks is \( m = n - num \).
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is used to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining \( m \) rows and columns.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in \( i \) rows and columns.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: One way to place a rook in one row and one column.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to place rooks in two rows and two columns.
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`: This accounts for placing a rook in one row and one column, and the remaining \( i-1 \) rows and columns, plus the ways to place two rooks in \( i-2 \) rows and columns.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final result is `dp[m]`, which gives the number of different final configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
  - It then reads the initial moves and updates the `num` variable accordingly.

- **Counting Occupied Rows and Columns:**
  - The code correctly increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`).
  - It increments `num` by 2 if the move is not on the diagonal (`r != c`).

- **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
  - The code initializes the `dp` array with the correct base cases.
  - The recurrence relation is implemented correctly, ensuring that the number of ways to place rooks is calculated modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1 correctly:
    - If `m == 0`, it prints 0.
    - If `m == 1`, it prints 1.

### Conclusion:

The code correctly implements the logic to count the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after all possible moves are made, ensuring no two rooks attack each other. The dynamic programming approach is sound and handles the constraints effectively.

**Final: **True**
