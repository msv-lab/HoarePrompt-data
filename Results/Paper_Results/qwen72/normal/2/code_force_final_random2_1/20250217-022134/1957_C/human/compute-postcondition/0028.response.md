Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user minus 1.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `c` and `r` are integers input by the user.
- `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `m` is not equal to 0.
- The current value of `m` is 1.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(1)
```

The print statement will simply print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
