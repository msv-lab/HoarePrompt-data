Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State Analysis:
- `k` is 0.
- `i` is `k - 1`, so `i` is -1.
- `num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented based on conditions inside the loop.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `t` is decreased by 1.
- `c` and `r` are the last set of input integers and remain unchanged.
- If `n` is 0, `i` and `dp` remain unchanged.
- If `n` is 1, `i` is -1 and `dp` remains unchanged.
- If `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n` and `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `n`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
- Additionally, `m` is 1 and `m` is not equal to 0.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(1)
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
2. The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their values, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables. It is a straightforward print statement that outputs the integer `1`.

### Conclusion:
The code snippet will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
