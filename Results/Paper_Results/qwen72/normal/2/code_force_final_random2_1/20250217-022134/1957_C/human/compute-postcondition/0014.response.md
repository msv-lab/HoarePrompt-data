The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `num` is set to 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, and to 2 if `c` is not equal to `r`. After the increment, `num` will be 2 if `c` is equal to `r`, and 3 if `c` is not equal to `r`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 < `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is 3.**
