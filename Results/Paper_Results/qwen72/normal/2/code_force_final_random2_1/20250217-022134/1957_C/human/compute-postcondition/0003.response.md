The provided Python code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. These integers represent the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, representing the number of remaining test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
- Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`.
- The `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.

After executing the code:
```
n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
```
- The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided.
- The values of `t` and the conditions related to the test cases remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, representing the number of remaining test cases. `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. The `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.**
