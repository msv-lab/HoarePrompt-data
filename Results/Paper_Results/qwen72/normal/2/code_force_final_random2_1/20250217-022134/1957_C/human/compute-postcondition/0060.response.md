The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The initial state specifies that `k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `c` and `r` are input integers. After executing the code, `c` and `r` will hold the values provided by the user.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are input integers.**
