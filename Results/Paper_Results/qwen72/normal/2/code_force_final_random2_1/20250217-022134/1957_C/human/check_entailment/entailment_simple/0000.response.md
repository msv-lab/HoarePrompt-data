Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of moves, considering the specific rules for placing rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

2. **Counting Initial Moves**: The program iterates through the `k` initial moves and counts the number of moves where the row and column indices are the same (`c == r`). This is important because such moves do not result in a mirrored move by the computer, affecting the total number of available positions for future moves.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**: The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, where `num` is the total number of moves that either resulted in a rook being placed on the diagonal or did not result in a mirrored move by the computer. This calculation is crucial for determining the number of remaining positions on the board that can still be used for placing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of different final configurations. The `dp` array is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which are the base cases for the number of configurations for a 1x1 and 2x2 board, respectively. The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` is used to fill in the rest of the `dp` array. This relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `i` by considering the previous configurations and the new positions that can be added.

5. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `dp[m]` for each test case, which represents the number of different final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program follows the problem statement and handles the constraints correctly. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles large inputs within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
