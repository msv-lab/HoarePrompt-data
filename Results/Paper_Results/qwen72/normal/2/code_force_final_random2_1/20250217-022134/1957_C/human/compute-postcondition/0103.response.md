The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `num` depends on whether `c` equals `r`. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is initially 2, and after incrementing, `num` becomes 3. If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is initially 3, and after incrementing, `num` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the new input integers. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 3. Otherwise, `num` is 4.**
