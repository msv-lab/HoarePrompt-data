Initial State: `k` is 0, `i` is 5, `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations, `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, `dp[3]` = 8, and `dp[4]` = 26.

The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula:
```
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Let's calculate the new value of `dp[5]`:
- `i` is 5
- `dp[4]` is 26
- `dp[3]` is 8
- `(i - 1)` is 4
- `2` is 2
- `10 ** 9 + 7` is 1000000007

Substituting these values into the formula:
```
dp[5] = (dp[4] + (i - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = (26 + 4 * 8 * 2) % 1000000007
dp[5] = (26 + 64) % 1000000007
dp[5] = 90 % 1000000007
dp[5] = 90
```

Therefore, the updated value of `dp[5]` is 90. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 5, `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations, `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, `dp[3]` = 8, `dp[4]` = 26, and `dp[5]` = 90.**
