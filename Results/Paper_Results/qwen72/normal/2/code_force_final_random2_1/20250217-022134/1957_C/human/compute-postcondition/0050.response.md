The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. However, `num` is not defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be an existing variable with an unknown initial value. The other variables (`k`, `i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are input integers, `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is increased by 1.**
