To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer input by the user minus 1.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is 3.
- `c` and `r` are integers input by the user.
- `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `m` is at least 3.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0.
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.
- `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the variable `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive.
- The loop condition is `i < m + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `m` must still satisfy the condition `i < m + 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`.
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `m` must remain such that `i < m + 1`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented from 3 to 4.
- `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is 4, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is at least 4, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10`**
