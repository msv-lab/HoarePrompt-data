The code snippet reads two integers from the user input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user.**
