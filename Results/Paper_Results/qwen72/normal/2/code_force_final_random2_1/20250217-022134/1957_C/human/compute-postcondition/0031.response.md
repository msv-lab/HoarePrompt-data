Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `dp[1] = 1` sets the value of the element at index 1 of the list `dp` to 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
