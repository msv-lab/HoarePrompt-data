The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is an integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 1), and `k` must still be greater than `i` (so `k` must be greater than 1).

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 < `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is set to 2.**
