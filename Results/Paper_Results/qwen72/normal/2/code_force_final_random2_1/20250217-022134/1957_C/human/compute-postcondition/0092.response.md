Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is -1, `num` is 1, `m` is `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the second set of input integers, `c` and `r` remain unchanged, and if `n` is 0, `i` and `dp` remain unchanged. If `n` is 1, `i` is -1 and `dp` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n` and `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `n`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, `c` is equal to `r`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
