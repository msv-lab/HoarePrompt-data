The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This operation does not affect the values of `k`, `i`, or `num`. However, it updates the values of `c` and `r` based on the input.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is unchanged.**
