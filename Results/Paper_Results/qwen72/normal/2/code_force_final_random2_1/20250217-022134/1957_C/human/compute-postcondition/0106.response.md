Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `k` is 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the last set of input integers and remain unchanged. If `n` is 0, `i` and `dp` remain unchanged. If `n` is 1, `i` is -1 and `dp` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n` and `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `n`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).`**

### Explanation:
- **`k` is 0**: The loop runs `k` times, so after all iterations, `k` is decremented to 0.
- **`i` is `k - 1`**: The loop variable `i` starts at -1 and increments by 1 each iteration, so after `k` iterations, `i` will be `k - 1`.
- **`num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented**: Depending on the conditions inside the loop, `num` is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r`, and by 2 if `c` does not equal `r`. The final value of `num` is the sum of these increments over all iterations.
- **Other variables (`m`, `n`, `t`, `c`, `r`, `dp`) remain unchanged**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so their values remain the same as they were before the loop started.
