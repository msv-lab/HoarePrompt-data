#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `n` and `k` retain their initial values, but the internal variables such as `num`, `m`, and `dp` are updated according to the logic within the loop. Specifically, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, and if `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent elements calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The final value of `dp[m]` is printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the size of a chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. It reads the moves and calculates a specific value based on the moves and the size of the board. The function prints the result for each test case, which represents the number of ways to place additional pieces on the board under certain constraints, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
