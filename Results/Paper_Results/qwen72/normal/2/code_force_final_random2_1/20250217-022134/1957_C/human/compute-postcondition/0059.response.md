The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must still be greater than `i`, which means `k` must be greater than 2.

State: **`k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are input integers. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2.**
