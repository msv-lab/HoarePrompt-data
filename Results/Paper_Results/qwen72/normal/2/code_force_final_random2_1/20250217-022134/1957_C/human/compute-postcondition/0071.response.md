Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `i` is -1, `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations. For each iteration where `c` equals `r`, `num` was incremented by 1, and for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was incremented by 2. `m` is `n - num`. The values of `n`, `t`, `c`, `r`, and `dp` remain unchanged from their initial states. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**
