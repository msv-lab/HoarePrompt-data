Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is 0.
- `i` is -1.
- `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations. For each iteration where `c` equals `r`, `num` was incremented by 1, and for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was incremented by 2.
- `m` is `n - num`, and the current value of `m` is 0.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `c`, `r`, and `dp` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Given that `m` is 0, we can infer that `n - num = 0`, which means `n = num`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(0)
```

This statement will print the integer 0.

Output: **0**
