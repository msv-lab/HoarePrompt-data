Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0. If `m` is 1, the conditions remain unchanged. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is updated to `m`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0, with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.***
