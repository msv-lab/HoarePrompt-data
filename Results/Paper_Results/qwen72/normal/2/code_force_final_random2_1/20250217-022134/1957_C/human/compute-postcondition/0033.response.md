To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the following variables:
- `i`: This is the loop variable that will take values from 3 to `m`.
- `m`: This is the upper bound of the range.

For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value. This means that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will start at 3, as specified in the range.
2. **`m`**: For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 3. Since `m` is defined as `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0 or 1, `m` must be at least 3.

Given these conditions, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `m` is at least 3. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `i` is 3**.
