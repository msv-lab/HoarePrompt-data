Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is `m`, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = m`. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `m`.
- The `dp` array is updated within the loop, with each element `dp[i]` being calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `num`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The final state of the `dp` array will contain the computed values from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]`, with the rest of the elements in the array remaining 0.
