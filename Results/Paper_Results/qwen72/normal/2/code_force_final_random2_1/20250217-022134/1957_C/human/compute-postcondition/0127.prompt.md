Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. The `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(0)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the conditions remain unchanged. If `m` is 1, the conditions remain unchanged. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is updated to `m`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0, with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`k` is 0, `i` is -1, `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations, where for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, `num` was incremented by 1, and for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was incremented by 2. `m` is `n - num`. The values of `n`, `t`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. If `m` is 0, the values of `i` and `dp` remain unchanged. If `m` is 1, `i` is -1 and `dp` remains unchanged. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is `m` and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After the loop executes all iterations, `k` is 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the last set of input integers and remain unchanged. If `n` is 0, `i` and `dp` remain unchanged. If `n` is 1, `i` is -1 and `dp` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n` and `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `n`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).` If `m` is 0, no additional changes are made. If `m` is not 0, and specifically if `m` is 1, the same conditions apply as described above. If `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent elements calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
