You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `n` and `k` retain their initial values, but the internal variables such as `num`, `m`, and `dp` are updated according to the logic within the loop. Specifically, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, and if `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent elements calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The final value of `dp[m]` is printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a chessboard size `n` and a number of moves `k`, followed by the specific moves made. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, likely involving some analysis or computation based on the moves.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
