The code snippet updates the frequency count of the first element (`n`) in the list `arr` within the dictionary `freq`. Initially, `freq` is an empty dictionary, so the key `n` does not exist. The `get` method retrieves the current value of `n` from `freq`, defaulting to 0 if `n` is not found, and then increments this value by 1. The updated value is then stored back in `freq` under the key `n`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and its value is 1.**
