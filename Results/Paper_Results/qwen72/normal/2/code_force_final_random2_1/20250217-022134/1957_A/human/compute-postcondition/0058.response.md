The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
- `w` must be greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- `ln` is an input integer.
- `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements.
- `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka` if it was not already present.
- `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the first element of `palka`) is either set to 1 (if it did not exist in `d` before) or incremented by 1.
- `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
- `i` is the second element of `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl`, it is now added to `pl`.

### Impact of the Code:
- The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

### Updated Variables:
- `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

### Unchanged Variables:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
- `w` remains greater than 1.
- `_` remains 1.
- `ln` remains an input integer.
- `palka` remains a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements.
- `pl` remains a list that may contain the first element of `palka` if it was not already present.
- `shapes` remains the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
- `i` remains the second element of `palka`.

### Output State:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka` if it was not already present, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the second element of `palka`) is incremented by 1, `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, and `i` is the second element of `palka`.**
