Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` and must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `palka`, `j` is the first element in `pl`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is set to 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.***
