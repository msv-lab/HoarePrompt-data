The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `pl`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If there are more elements in `pl`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 2 unique integers, and `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least 3 unique integers, and `j` will be the third unique integer in `pl`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has been fully iterated over, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 3 unique integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1, where `j` is the third unique integer in `pl`.**
