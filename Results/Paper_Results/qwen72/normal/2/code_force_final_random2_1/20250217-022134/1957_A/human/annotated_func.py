#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the count of a specific integer in the `arr` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr`, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 4. After the function concludes, the original list `arr` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the total number of groups of 4 sticks that can be formed from each unique stick length.
