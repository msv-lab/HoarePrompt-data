Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `palka`.
- For each element `i`, if it is not already in the list `pl`, it is added to `pl`. This ensures that `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- The dictionary `d` keeps track of the count of each element in `palka`. If `i` is not already a key in `d`, it is added with a value of 1. If `i` is already a key, its value is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `d` will contain the count of each element in `palka`.
- The variable `shapes` is calculated as the total number of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times. This is derived from the dictionary `d` by counting the keys whose values are 3 or greater.
