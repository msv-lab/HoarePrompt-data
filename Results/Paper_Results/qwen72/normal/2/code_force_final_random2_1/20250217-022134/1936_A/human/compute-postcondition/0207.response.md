To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`n`**: This is the input integer and remains the same throughout the execution.
2. **`i`**: This is set to `n`.
3. **`mak`**: This is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the user input.
4. **`mak2`**: This is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
5. **`pans`**: This is a list that contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`. It must have at least `n + 1` elements.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Let's analyze the values being printed:

- **`pans[mak]`**: This is the element in the `pans` list at the index `mak`. Since `mak` can be either 0 or `n-1`, `pans[mak]` will be either the first element of `pans` (if `mak` is 0) or the `n-1`-th element of `pans` (if `mak` is `n-1`).
- **`pans[i]`**: This is the element in the `pans` list at the index `i`. Since `i` is set to `n`, `pans[i]` will be the `n`-th element of `pans`.

Since `pans` must have at least `n + 1` elements, both `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are valid indices.

Therefore, the output will be:
- The string `'?'`
- The value of `pans[mak]` repeated twice
- The value of `pans[i]` repeated twice

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where [pans[mak]] is the element at index mak in the pans list and [pans[i]] is the element at index i in the pans list)**
