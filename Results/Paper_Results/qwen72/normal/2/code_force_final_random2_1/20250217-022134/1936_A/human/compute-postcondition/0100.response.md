Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the user input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and the current value of `s` is `<`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `mak`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
