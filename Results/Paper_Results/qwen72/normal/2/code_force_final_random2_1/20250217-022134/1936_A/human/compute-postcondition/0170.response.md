The `sys.stdout.flush()` function flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all buffered data is written out immediately. This operation does not change the values of any variables or affect the program's state beyond ensuring that any pending output is displayed.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is an empty list, and the standard output buffer has been flushed.**
