To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`n`**: This is a constant value that remains the same throughout the execution.
2. **`i`**: This is set to `n-1`.
3. **`mak`**: This is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`.
4. **`mak2`**: This is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
5. **`pans`**: This is a list containing all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`.

Given these definitions, the `print` statement will output the following:

- **`mak2`**: This is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- **`pans[mak]`**: This is the element in the `pans` list at the index `mak`, where `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`.

Since the exact values of `mak2` and `pans[mak]` depend on the user inputs, we can describe them in terms of their definitions:

- **`mak2`**: The largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- **`pans[mak]`**: The element in the `pans` list at the index `mak`, where `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **! [mak2] [pans[mak]] (where mak2 is the largest integer i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was <, and pans[mak] is the element in the pans list at the index mak, where mak is the index of the last element in pans for which the user input was >)**
