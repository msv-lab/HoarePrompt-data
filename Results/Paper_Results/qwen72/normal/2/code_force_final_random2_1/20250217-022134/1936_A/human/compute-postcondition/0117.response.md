Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `s` is the user input string.
- The output buffer has been flushed.
- If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`.
- If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`.
- Otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mak` and `mak2`**:
   - Both `mak` and `mak2` are described as the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
   - However, if `s` is `<`, `mak` is explicitly set to 1.
   - Since `mak2` is also described similarly, it should also be 1 if `s` is `<`.

2. **`i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly set to 2.

3. **`s`**:
   - The value of `s` determines the values of `mak` and `pans`.
   - If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`.
   - If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.

### Conclusion:
- If `s` is `<`, then `mak` and `mak2` are both 1.
- If `s` is `=`, the values of `mak` and `mak2` are not explicitly defined, but since they are described similarly, they would both be the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, which is not applicable here because `s` is `=`.
- If `s` is anything else, the values of `mak` and `mak2` are not explicitly defined, but they would both be the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, which is not applicable here because `s` is not `<`.

Given the precondition, the most precise and consistent interpretation is that if `s` is `<`, then `mak` and `mak2` are both 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 1 1 2 1**
