Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the output.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, and `pans` is an empty list if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down the values of the variables:

- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak2` is again equal to `mak`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following:

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is the value of `mak`.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`.

So, the output will be:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists)**
