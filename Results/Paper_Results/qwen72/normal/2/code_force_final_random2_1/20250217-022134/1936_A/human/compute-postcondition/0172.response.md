Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is an empty list, the standard output buffer has been flushed, and `s` is the user input string. Additionally, the current value of `s` is `<`.**
