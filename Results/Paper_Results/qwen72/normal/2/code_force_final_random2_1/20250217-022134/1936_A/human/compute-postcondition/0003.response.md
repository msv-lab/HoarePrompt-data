The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range function generates numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` will start at 1.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `mak` is 0, `i` is 1**
