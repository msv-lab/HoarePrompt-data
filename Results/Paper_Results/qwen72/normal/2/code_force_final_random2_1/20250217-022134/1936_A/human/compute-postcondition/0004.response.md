Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `n` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3 (the exact value of `n` is not needed for this print statement).
- `mak` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

1. The string `'?'` will be printed as is.
2. The value of `mak` (which is 0) will be printed.
3. The value of `mak` (which is 0) will be printed again.
4. The value of `i` (which is 1) will be printed.
5. The value of `i` (which is 1) will be printed again.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
