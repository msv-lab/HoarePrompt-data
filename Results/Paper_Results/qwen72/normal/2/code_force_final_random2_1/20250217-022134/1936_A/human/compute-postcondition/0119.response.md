Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string, the output buffer has been flushed, if `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`, if `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`, otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.** 

The value of `s` is now the user input string. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
