Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the original value of `mak` (which could be 0 or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<`), `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
