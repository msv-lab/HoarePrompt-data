Functionality: ** The function interacts with an environment to determine a pair of indices (i, j) in a secret permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized. It achieves this by making a series of queries, ensuring no more than 3n queries are used. For each test case, it outputs the indices (i, j) that maximize the bitwise XOR. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input variable `n` unchanged, and the standard output buffer is flushed. **
