Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `mak`. The initial condition that `n` is greater than 2 remains unchanged. The initial condition about the user input affecting `mak` is no longer relevant because `mak` is explicitly set to 2.
