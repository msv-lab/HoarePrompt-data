To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the condition for the loop to execute is that `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means that the input provided by the user must be a positive integer.

Given the context of the problem, the input is the number of test cases `t`, and it is specified that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`. Therefore, the input must be a positive integer within this range for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3)**
