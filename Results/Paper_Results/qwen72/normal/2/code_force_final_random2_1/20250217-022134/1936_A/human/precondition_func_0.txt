The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a secret permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the interaction involves querying the comparison of bitwise OR results of selected indices. The function must find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized, using no more than 3n queries. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, the length of the permutation n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
