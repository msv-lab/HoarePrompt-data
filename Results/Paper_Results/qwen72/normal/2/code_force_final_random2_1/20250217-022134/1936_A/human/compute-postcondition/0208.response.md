Output State: **`n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n`, `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on the user input, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least `n + 1` elements, the standard output buffer has been flushed.** 

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the standard output buffer is flushed, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the initial state.
