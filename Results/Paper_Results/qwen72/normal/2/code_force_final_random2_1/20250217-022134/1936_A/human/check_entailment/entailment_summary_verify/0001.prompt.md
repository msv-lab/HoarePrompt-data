You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Function Summary: 
The function interacts with an environment to determine a pair of indices (i, j) in a secret permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized. It achieves this by making a series of queries, ensuring no more than 3n queries are used. For each test case, it outputs the indices (i, j) that maximize the bitwise XOR. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input variable `n` unchanged, and the standard output buffer is flushed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make up to \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.
   - The goal is to use these queries to identify the indices with the maximum XOR value.

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \( \text{mak} \) such that \( p_{\text{mak}} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - This is done by comparing \( p_{\text{mak}} \) with each \( p_i \) for \( i \) in \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \).

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - Once \( \text{mak} \) is identified, the program then tries to find another index \( \text{mak2} \) such that \( p_{\text{mak}} \oplus p_{\text{mak2}} \) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{\text{mak}} \) with each \( p_i \) again, but this time it keeps track of indices that have the same value as \( p_{\text{mak}} \) (i.e., \( p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_i = p_{\text{mak}} \)).

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - After identifying potential candidates for \( \text{mak2} \), the program compares the XOR values of these candidates to find the maximum.
   - It prints the indices \( \text{mak2} \) and the candidate with the maximum XOR value.

5. **Query Count:**
   - The program makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( \text{mak} \).
   - It then makes \( n \) queries to find potential candidates for \( \text{mak2} \).
   - Finally, it makes up to \( \text{len(pans)} - 1 \) queries to find the maximum XOR value among the candidates.
   - The total number of queries is \( (n-1) + n + (\text{len(pans)} - 1) \leq 3n \), which satisfies the constraint.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will directly compare the two elements and output the result.
   - For larger \( n \), the program ensures that it finds the maximum XOR value efficiently within the query limit.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, while adhering to the query limit. Therefore, the program is correct.
