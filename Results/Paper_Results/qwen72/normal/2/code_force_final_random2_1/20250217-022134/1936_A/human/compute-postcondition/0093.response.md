Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
