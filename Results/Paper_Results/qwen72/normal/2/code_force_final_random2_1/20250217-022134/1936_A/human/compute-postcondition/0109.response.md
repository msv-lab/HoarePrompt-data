Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.** 

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
