Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `s` is `=`, and `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<`, and `pans` is an empty list if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`. The output buffer has been flushed.**
