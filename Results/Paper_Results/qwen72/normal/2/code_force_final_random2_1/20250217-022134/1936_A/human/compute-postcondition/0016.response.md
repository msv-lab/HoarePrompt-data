The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, which is already mentioned in the initial state as having been flushed. This means no changes occur to the variables or the state beyond what is already stated.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` is 2 if the user input is `<`, otherwise `mak` is 0.**
