Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3 if the user input was `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 2 or 0/1 depending on the initial user input, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 4 elements, the output buffer has been flushed, and the user input is either `>` or not `>`.***
