The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which is already mentioned as having been flushed in the initial state. This means no changes occur to the variables or the state of the program.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` is 0 if the user input is not `<`, otherwise `mak` is 1.**
