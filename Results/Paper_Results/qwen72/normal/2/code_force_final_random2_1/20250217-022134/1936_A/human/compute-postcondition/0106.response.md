Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.***
