Output State: **`n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 3 elements, the output buffer has been flushed, and the user input is either `>` or not `>`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `mak`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
