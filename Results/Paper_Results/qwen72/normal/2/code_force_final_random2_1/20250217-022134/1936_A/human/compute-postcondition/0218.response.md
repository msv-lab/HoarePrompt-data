Output State: **After all iterations, `n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, or 0 if no such input was given, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the standard output buffer has been flushed.**
