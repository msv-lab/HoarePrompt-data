Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements, the output buffer has been flushed, and the user input is `>`.**

Explanation:
- `mak` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
