Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is an empty list.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`. Since `mak` is defined but not explicitly given a value, it could be any integer between 1 and n-1, depending on the user input.
- `mak2` is also the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`. This means `mak2` could be the same as `mak` or a different value, but it must also be between 1 and n-1.
- `i` is explicitly set to 0.
- `mak2` is repeated twice in the print statement.

### Output:
The print statement will output a string with the following format:
- The first element is the character `?`.
- The second element is the value of `mak`.
- The third element is the value of `mak2`.
- The fourth element is the value of `i`, which is 0.
- The fifth element is the value of `mak2` again.

Since `mak` and `mak2` are not explicitly given values, they could be any integer between 1 and n-1, but they are determined by the user input.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 0 [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are the largest integers i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`)**
