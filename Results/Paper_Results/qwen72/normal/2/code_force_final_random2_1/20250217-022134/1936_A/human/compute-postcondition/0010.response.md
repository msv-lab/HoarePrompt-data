Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the output.
- `n` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
- `i` is set to 2.
- The output buffer has been flushed, meaning any previous output has been processed.
- If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

Given this information, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

- The first element in the `print` statement is the string `'?'`.
- The next two elements are the value of `mak`, which depends on the user input:
  - If the user input is `<`, `mak` is 1.
  - Otherwise, `mak` is 0.
- The last two elements are the value of `i`, which is 2.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `mak`:

- If the user input is `<`, `mak` is 1, so the output will be:
  ```
  ? 1 1 2 2
  ```

- If the user input is anything other than `<`, `mak` remains 0, so the output will be:
  ```
  ? 0 0 2 2
  ```

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 1 if the user input is `<`, otherwise [mak] is 0)**
