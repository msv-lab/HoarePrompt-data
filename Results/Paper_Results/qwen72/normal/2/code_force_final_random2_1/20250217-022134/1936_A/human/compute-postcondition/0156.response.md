Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- If the user input is a string equal to `<`, `mak` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `mak` remains undefined.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. **`mak`**: The value of `mak` depends on the user input:
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 1.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, `mak` remains undefined.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1: User input is `<`**
  - `mak` is set to 1.
  - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.

- **Scenario 2: User input is not `<`**
  - `mak` remains undefined.
  - The print statement will raise a `NameError` because `mak` is not defined.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will depend on the user input. If the user input is `<`, the output will be:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**

If the user input is not `<`, the code will raise a `NameError` and no output will be printed. However, since the task is to determine what will be printed, we assume the user input is `<` for a valid output.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
