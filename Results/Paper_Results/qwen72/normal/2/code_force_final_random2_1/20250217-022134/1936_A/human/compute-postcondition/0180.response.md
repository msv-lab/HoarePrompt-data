The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list, the standard output buffer has been flushed, and `s` is the user input string.**
