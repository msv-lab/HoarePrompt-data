To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) (not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is 3.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this does not affect the print statement directly).
   - If the user input is `<`, `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `mak`:**
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input.
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is 2.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, then `mak` is 0.

4. **Determine the Values to be Printed:**
   - The first element in the print statement is the string `'?'`.
   - The next two elements are the value of `mak`.
   - The last two elements are the value of `i`, which is 3.

5. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is 2. The print statement will be:
     ```python
     print('?', 2, 2, 3, 3)
     ```
     Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, then `mak` is 0. The print statement will be:
     ```python
     print('?', 0, 0, 3, 3)
     ```
     Output: **? 0 0 3 3**

Since the user input is not specified, we need to consider both cases. However, if we assume the user input is `<` (as it is a common scenario in such problems):

Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
