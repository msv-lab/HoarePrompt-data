Output State: **`n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, or it remains the highest index where the user input was `>` during the loop, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.** 

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command ensures that any buffered output is immediately written to the terminal or output stream, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
