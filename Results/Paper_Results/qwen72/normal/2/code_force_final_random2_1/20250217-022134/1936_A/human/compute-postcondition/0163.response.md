Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3, if the user input is a string equal to `<`, `mak` is 1; otherwise, `mak` is 3.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `mak`. Since `i` was already 3, `mak` is now 3. However, the condition about the user input being `<` still holds, so if the user input is `<`, `mak` would be 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 3. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
