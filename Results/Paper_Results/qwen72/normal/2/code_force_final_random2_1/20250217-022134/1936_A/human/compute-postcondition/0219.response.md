Output State: **After all iterations, `n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, or 0 if no such input was given, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the standard output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `n` retains its original value as provided by the input.
- The variable `i` reaches the value `n-1` after the inner loops complete their iterations.
- The variable `mak` holds the index of the last element in the list `pans` for which the user input was `>`. If no such input was received, `mak` is set to 0.
- The variable `mak2` stores the largest integer `i` (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- The list `pans` contains all integers `i` (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was either `=` or `<`.
- The standard output buffer has been flushed after each query and final result, ensuring all outputs are processed.
