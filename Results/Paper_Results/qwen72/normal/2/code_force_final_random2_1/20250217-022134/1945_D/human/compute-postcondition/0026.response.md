The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` updates the value of `soma_b` by adding the value of `lista_B[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, this means `soma_b` is updated by adding the third element of `lista_B` (since list indices start at 0).

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than `k`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
   - `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`.
   - `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`.
   - If `lista_A[1] < lista_B[1]`, then `pref` is the sum of its initial value and the second element of `lista_A`, and `soma_b` remains 0.
   - Otherwise, `soma_b` is the sum of the first element of `lista_B` and `lista_B[1]`, and `pref` is 0.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - `soma_b` is incremented by the value of `lista_B[2]`.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `soma_b` is now the sum of its previous value and `lista_B[2]`.

4. **Unchanged Values:**
   - `n` is greater than `k`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
   - `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`.
   - `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`.
   - The condition regarding `lista_A[1]` and `lista_B[1]` remains the same, affecting `pref` and the initial value of `soma_b`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `soma_b` is the sum of its previous value and `lista_B[2]`, and the condition regarding `lista_A[1]` and `lista_B[1]` remains the same.**
