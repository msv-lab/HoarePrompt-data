Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is considered correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Reversing Lists**: By reversing the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, the program simplifies the logic for calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes `soma_b` to keep track of the cumulative cost of bribing people between positions.
   - It iterates through the first `n - k` positions to calculate the initial cost of moving to these positions.
   - For the remaining positions (`n - k` to `n`), it calculates the minimum cost to move to any of these positions.
4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements, ensuring that Kirill spends the minimum number of coins to achieve his goal. Therefore, the program is correct.
