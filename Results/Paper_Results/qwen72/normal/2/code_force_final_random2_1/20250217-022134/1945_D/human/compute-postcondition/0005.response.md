The only variable in the loop head is `_` (the loop counter) and `numero_testes`. The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `_` is less than `numero_testes`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 1 < `numero_testes` <= 10^4. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked, it is implied by the number of iterations that have occurred. For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must still be greater than the current value of `_`.

Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, and the loop can continue as long as `_` is less than `numero_testes`, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 2 < `numero_testes` <= 10^4**
