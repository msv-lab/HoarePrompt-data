The value of `pref` is updated by adding `lista_A[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is 2, `pref` is incremented by `lista_A[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. If `lista_A[1] < lista_B[1]`, then `pref` is the sum of its initial value, `lista_A[1]`, and `lista_A[2]`, and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `pref` is the sum of `lista_B[0]`, `lista_B[1]`, and `lista_A[2]`, and `soma_b` is the sum of `lista_B[0]` and `lista_B[1]`.**
