The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, followed by two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`. It reverses both lists and calculates a value `resultado` which is the minimum sum of elements from `lista_A` and `lista_B` under specific conditions. Specifically, `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all `i` from `n - k - 1` to `n - 1`, where `pref` and `soma_b` are computed based on the comparison of elements in `lista_A` and `lista_B`. Finally, the function prints the calculated `resultado`.
