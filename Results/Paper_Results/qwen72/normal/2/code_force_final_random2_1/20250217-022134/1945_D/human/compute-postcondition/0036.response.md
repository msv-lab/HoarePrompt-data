Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is `n - k`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `pref` is the sum of all elements from `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` during the loop, plus the cumulative `soma_b` values added to it when `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, `soma_b` is now `soma_b + lista_B[i]`, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `soma_b` is updated to `soma_b + lista_B[i]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref`, `resultado`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `n` is greater than `k` and the constraints on `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000) are still valid.
- The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are still reversed lists of integers of length `n`.
- The value of `pref` remains the same, which is the sum of all elements from `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` during the loop, plus the cumulative `soma_b` values added to it when `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`.
- The value of `resultado` remains the minimum of its current value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
