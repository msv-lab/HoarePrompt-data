### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The function reads `n` and `k` from the input, followed by two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`. These lists are reversed.
   - **Logic:**
     - The function initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
     - It iterates through the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists:
       - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it adds `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]` to `pref`, and resets `soma_b` to 0.
       - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
     - After the initial loop, it initializes `resultado` to infinity.
     - It then iterates through the remaining elements (from `n - k` to `n - 1`):
       - For each element, it updates `resultado` to the minimum of its current value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
       - It also adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
     - Finally, it prints `resultado`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The function reads the number of test cases `numero_testes` from the input.
   - **Logic:**
     - It iterates `numero_testes` times, calling `func_1()` in each iteration.
     - This ensures that `func_1` is called for each test case, processing the input and producing the required output.

### Conclusion:
- **Function `func_1`** correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The logic for calculating `pref` and `soma_b` is sound and aligns with the problem statement.
- **Function `func_2`** correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given that both functions work as intended and handle the input and output correctly, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
