You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, lista_A and lista_B are lists of integers of length n where each element is in the range [1, 10^9].
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `n` is greater than `k`, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. `pref` is the sum of all elements from `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` during the loop, plus the cumulative `soma_b` values added to it when `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`. `soma_b` is the sum of all elements from `lista_B` that were greater than or equal to their corresponding elements in `lista_A` during the loop.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all `i` from `n - k - 1` to `n - 1`, and `soma_b` is the sum of all elements from `lista_B` from index `n - k - 1` to `n - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref`) remain unchanged.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all `i` from `n - k - 1` to `n - 1`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`. `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers of length `n`, with each element in the range [1, 10^9]. The function returns a result based on these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
