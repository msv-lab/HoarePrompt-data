Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is 0, and the first element of `lista_A` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lista_B`.**
