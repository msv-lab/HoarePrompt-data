### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Kirill starts at the end of the queue and wants to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - Moving to position `j` from position `i` costs `a_j` coins plus `b_k` coins for each `k` between `j` and `i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` to simplify the process of moving Kirill from the end to the front.
   - It iterates through the first `n - k` positions to calculate the minimum cost of moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - For each position `i` in the first `n - k` positions, it checks if the cost `a_i` is less than the cost `b_i`. If so, it adds the cost `a_i` and the accumulated cost `soma_b` to the prefix sum `pref`.
   - After processing the first `n - k` positions, it calculates the minimum cost for the remaining positions and updates the result accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n`, meaning Kirill is already in the desired position.
   - It also handles the case where `m` is 1, meaning Kirill needs to move to the very first position.

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input for a single test case and prints the result.
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - The use of reversed lists simplifies the logic and ensures that the algorithm works efficiently.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Reversing the Lists**:
  - Reversing the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` allows the algorithm to start from the end of the queue and move towards the front, which simplifies the logic for calculating the minimum cost.
  - This approach is valid and efficient.

- **Cost Calculation**:
  - The algorithm correctly accumulates the cost `soma_b` for the positions between `j` and `i`.
  - It correctly updates the prefix sum `pref` when the cost `a_i` is less than the cost `b_i`.

- **Result Calculation**:
  - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost for the remaining positions and updates the result accordingly.
  - The use of `float('inf')` to initialize `resultado` ensures that the minimum cost is correctly calculated.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The algorithm handles the edge cases where `m` is equal to `n` or `m` is 1 correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. The algorithm is logically sound and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
