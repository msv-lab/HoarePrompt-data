Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is equal to the first element of `lista_A` and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is equal to the first element of `lista_B` and `pref` is 0.***
