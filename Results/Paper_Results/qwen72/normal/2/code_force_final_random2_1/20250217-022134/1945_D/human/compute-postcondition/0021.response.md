Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. If `lista_A[1] < lista_B[1]`, then `pref` is the sum of its initial value and the second element of `lista_A`, and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is the sum of the first element of `lista_B` and `lista_B[1]`, and `pref` is 0.***
