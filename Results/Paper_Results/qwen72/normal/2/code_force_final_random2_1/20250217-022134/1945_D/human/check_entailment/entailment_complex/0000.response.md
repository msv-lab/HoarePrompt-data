Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from the input, followed by two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`.
   - It reverses both lists to facilitate the calculation from the end of the queue to the front.
   - It initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it adds `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - It then initializes `resultado` to infinity and iterates through the remaining elements (from `n - k` to `n - 1`):
     - It updates `resultado` to the minimum of its current value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
     - It adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - Finally, it prints `resultado`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads `numero_testes` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It iterates `numero_testes` times, calling `func_1()` in each iteration.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: Both functions correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement.
- **Logic**:
  - The logic in `func_1` is designed to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions.
  - The function correctly reverses the lists to process the elements from the end of the queue to the front.
  - The use of `soma_b` and `pref` ensures that the costs are accumulated correctly based on the conditions given.
  - The final loop correctly updates `resultado` to the minimum possible cost.
- **Output**: The function prints the correct result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The functions handle the input and output as expected, and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
