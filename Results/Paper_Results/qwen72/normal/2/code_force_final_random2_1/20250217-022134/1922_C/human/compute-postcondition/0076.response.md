Postcondition: **The list `a` has `n` elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the new values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and the remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will have grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements. The variables `t`, `m`, and `u` are set to the values returned by the function `r()`, and `u` is now `u - 3` which must evaluate to a truthy value. The new values of `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`. If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
