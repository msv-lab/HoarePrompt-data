Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is now `[0, 0, v, v], `v` is `y - x`, `w` is the first element of `a`, `x` is the second element of `a`, `y` is the third element of `a`, `z` is the fourth element of `a`.** 

Explanation: The variable `v` is assigned the value of `y - x`, where `y` is the third element of `a` and `x` is the second element of `a`. The variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to the next set of values from `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]` respectively. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
