To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**: 
   - Remains unchanged with its initial values: `-1000000000.0`, followed by the new final values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and ends with `2000000000.0`.
   - Therefore, `a` looks like: `[-1000000000.0, c, d, 2000000000.0]`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - Updated to contain more elements based on the loop's operations, but the exact values depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
   - Let's denote the elements of `b` as `b[0], b[1], b[2], ...`.

3. **Variables `t`, `m`, and `u`**:
   - Updated to their new values returned by the function `r()`.
   - `t` is now `t - 1`.
   - `u` is now `u - 2` and must be greater than 1.
   - `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`.

4. **Comparison of `c` and `d`**:
   - If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the indices in `b`**:
   - The expression `(d - 1) * 2` calculates the index in `b` based on the value of `d`.
   - The expression `(c - 1) * 2` calculates the index in `b` based on the value of `c`.

2. **Access the elements in `b`**:
   - `b[(d - 1) * 2]` accesses the element at the index `(d - 1) * 2`.
   - `b[(c - 1) * 2]` accesses the element at the index `(c - 1) * 2`.

3. **Calculate the difference**:
   - The difference is computed as `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the difference. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the elements in `b` at the specified indices.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b[(d - 1) * 2] is the element at index (d - 1) * 2 in list b, and b[(c - 1) * 2] is the element at index (c - 1) * 2 in list b)**
