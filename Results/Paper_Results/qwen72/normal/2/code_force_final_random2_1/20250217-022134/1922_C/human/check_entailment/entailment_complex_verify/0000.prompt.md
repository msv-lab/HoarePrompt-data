You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: `t` is 0 (or a falsy value), `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is a list with length `2 * (n - 3)` appended to the initial `[0, 0]` and each element in `b` from index 2 onwards is calculated as `b[i] = b[i-2] + (y - x)`, `u` is 0 (falsy), `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()` during the last iteration. If `c` is less than `d`, the condition `c < d` holds true. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the condition `c >= d` holds true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cities positioned on a number line and a series of queries about the distances between certain pairs of cities. For each test case, it reads the number of cities and their positions, then calculates a list of cumulative distances between adjacent city pairs. It then reads the number of queries and the queries themselves, and for each query, it prints the distance between the specified cities based on the precomputed cumulative distances. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function concludes with the state where `t` is 0, `u` is 0, and the lists `a` and `b` contain the processed city positions and cumulative distances, respectively.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Costs**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city using a formula involving powers (`v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)`). This is incorrect because the cost to travel to the closest city should always be 1 coin, not a value derived from the distances.

2. **Handling of Queries**:
   - The program uses a list `b` to store cumulative costs, but the way it calculates these costs is flawed. The correct approach should involve precomputing the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city and then using this information to handle queries efficiently.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, it assumes that the closest city can always be determined by the given logic, which may not hold true for all inputs.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a lambda function `r` to read input, which is not a common or clear way to handle input in Python. This makes the code harder to understand and debug.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program's current logic will produce incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above. Specifically, the calculation of the cumulative costs in the list `b` is incorrect, leading to wrong answers for the queries.
