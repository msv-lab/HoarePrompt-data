The provided code defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. This function `r` can be used to read multiple integers from a single line of input.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line; m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; and a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. A lambda function `r` is defined to read and map input to integers.**
