Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is a list with length `n-3` appended to the initial `[0, 0]`. Each element in `b` from index 2 onwards is calculated as follows: `b[i] = b[i-2] + (y - x) ** ((y - x) > (x - w))` for even indices and `b[i] = b[i-1] + (y - x) ** ((y - x) > (z - y))` for odd indices, where `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are consecutive elements in `a` starting from the beginning.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** The initial state includes the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `b` as described.
- **Loop Execution:** The loop iterates over the elements of `a` in groups of four (`w`, `x`, `y`, `z`). For each iteration, it calculates the difference `v = y - x` and updates the list `b` based on the conditions `v > x - w` and `v > z - y`.
- **Final State:** After all iterations, the list `b` will have been extended by `n-3` elements. The first two elements of `b` remain `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent element is calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop. The final state of `b` will reflect these calculations, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`) remain unchanged.
