Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `a` now starts with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the new final values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and ends with `2000000000.0`. The list `b` is now `[0, 0]`. The variables `t`, `m`, and `u` are set to the new values returned by the function `r()`, and `t` is now `t - 1`. The list `b` will no longer have grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is `y - x`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is `-1000000000.0`, the second element of `a` is the new value of `c` returned by `r()`, the third element of `a` is the new value of `d` returned by `r()`, the fourth element of `a` is `2000000000.0`, `b` is updated by appending `b[-2] + v

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` is `y - x`, `a` is a list with at least 5 elements where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the second element is the new value of `c` returned by `r()`, the third element is the new value of `d` returned by `r()`, the fourth element is `2000000000.0`, and the fifth element is unknown. `b` is updated by appending `b[-2] + v

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v` is `y - x`, `a` is a list with at least 6 elements where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the second element is the new value of `c` returned by `r()`, the third element is the new value of `d` returned by `r()`, the fourth element is `2000000000.0`, the fifth element is unknown, and the sixth element is unknown. `b` is updated by appending `b[-2] + v




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
