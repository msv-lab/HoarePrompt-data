To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - These variables are derived from the lists `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]`.

2. **Understand the Iteration Process:**
   - The `zip` function pairs elements from the four lists: `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]`.
   - For each iteration, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` take the next set of values from these lists.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are enough elements in `a` to form the tuples `(w, x, y, z)`.
   - Specifically, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 4 elements remaining.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
     - `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
     - `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
     - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9
     - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5
     - `b` is now `[0, 0, v, v]`

   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 4 elements remaining. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, and we have already processed some elements, the remaining length of `a` must be at least 4.

### Adjusted State:
- The list `a` must have at least 4 elements remaining for the loop to execute one more time.
- The variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will take the next set of values from `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is now `[0, 0, v, v], `a` must have at least 4 elements remaining**
