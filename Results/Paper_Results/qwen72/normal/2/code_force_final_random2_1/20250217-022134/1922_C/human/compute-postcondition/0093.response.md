To determine what will be printed by the `print(b, 'B')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications:

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` remains unchanged with its initial values: `-1000000000.0`, followed by the new final values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and ends with `2000000000.0`.
   - This means `a` looks like: `[-1000000000.0, c, d, 2000000000.0]`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - The list `b` is updated to contain more elements based on the loop's operations, but the exact values depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
   - Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we can only describe the general form of `b`.

3. **Variables `t`, `m`, and `u`**:
   - These variables remain unchanged from their new values returned by the function `r()`.
   - `t` is still `t - 1`.

### Analysis:
- The list `b` is populated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. Let's denote the elements of `a` as `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`.
- The differences between consecutive elements in `a` are:
  - `a[1] - a[0]`
  - `a[2] - a[1]`
  - `a[3] - a[2]`

- Therefore, the list `b` will contain these differences:
  - `b = [a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`

- Substituting the known values:
  - `a[0] = -1000000000.0`
  - `a[1] = c`
  - `a[2] = d`
  - `a[3] = 2000000000.0`

- The differences are:
  - `b[0] = c - (-1000000000.0) = c + 1000000000.0`
  - `b[1] = d - c`
  - `b[2] = 2000000000.0 - d`

### Final Output:
The `print(b, 'B')` statement will print the list `b` followed by the string 'B'. The list `b` contains the differences calculated as described above.

Output: **[c + 1000000000.0, d - c, 2000000000.0 - d], B**
