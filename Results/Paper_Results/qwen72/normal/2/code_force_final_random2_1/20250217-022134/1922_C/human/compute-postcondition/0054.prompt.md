Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a list with the initial elements `[0, 0]`, `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the second element is `c`, the third element is `d`, and the last element is `2000000000.0`, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `u` is 0 (falsy), `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the condition `c < d` holds true. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the condition `c >= d` holds true.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `a` has at least 4 elements: `-1000000000.0`, `c`, `d`, and a fourth element. The variable `v` is `y - x`. The list `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + v

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `a` has at least 5 elements: `-1000000000.0`, `c`, `d`, a fourth element, and a fifth element. The variable `v` is `y - d`. The list `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + v` if `y - d > d - c`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`, and `b[-1] + v` if `y - d > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`. `w` is `c`, `x` is `d`, `y` is the fourth element, and `z` is the fifth element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `a` has at least 6 elements: `-1000000000.0`, `c`, `d`, a fourth element, a fifth element, and a sixth element. `w` is `d`, `x` is the fourth element, `y` is the fifth element, `z` is the sixth element, `v` is `y - x`, and `b` is updated to include two new elements: `b[-2] + v




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
