The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'##..##'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `casos` must be greater than 1.
- `c` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 20.

None of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Output: **##..##**
