The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `"..##"`. The initial state provides information about variables such as `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- For each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is 0.
- The current value of `n` is 2.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `"..##"`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **..##**
