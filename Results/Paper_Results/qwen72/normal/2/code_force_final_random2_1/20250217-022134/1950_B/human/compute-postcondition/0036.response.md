The only objects in the loop head are the variables `c` and `casos`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `c` is less than `casos`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0 and `casos` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `casos` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `casos` must be greater than 1, and `c` is 1. If `n` is 1, then `n` remains 1. If `n` is 2, 3, or 4, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, then `n` also remains unchanged.**
