Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- For each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is 0.
- `n` is not equal to 1.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- The current value of `n` is 3.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('##..##')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'##..##'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the same string regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `casos`, or `c`.

Output: **##..##**
