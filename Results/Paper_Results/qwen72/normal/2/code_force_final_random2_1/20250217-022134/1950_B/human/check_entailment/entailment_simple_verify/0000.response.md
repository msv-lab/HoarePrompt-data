Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) explicitly and fails to handle any other values of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For any value of `n` outside these four cases, the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This behavior does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which states that the program should generate a checkerboard for any valid `n` within the range. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
