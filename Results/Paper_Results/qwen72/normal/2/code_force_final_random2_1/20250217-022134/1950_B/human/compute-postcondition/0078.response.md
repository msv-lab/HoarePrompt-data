The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement is: `print('##..##..')`.
- This statement will simply print the string `'##..##..'`.

Output: **##..##..**
