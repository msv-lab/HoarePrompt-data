The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string. The initial state provides context about variables such as `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- For each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is 0.
- The current value of `n` is 4.

However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'##..##..'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..##..**
