The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string. The initial state provides information about variables such as `t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` must be greater than 1.
- `c` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'..##..'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **..##..**
