Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. If `n` == 2, the state remains unchanged. If `n` == 3 or `n` == 4, the state also remains unchanged. For all other values of `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, the state remains unchanged.***
