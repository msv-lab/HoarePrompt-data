Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- For each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is 0.
- The current value of `n` is 1.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('##')
```

This code snippet does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'##'`.

Output: **##**
