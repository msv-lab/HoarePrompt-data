Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- For each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is 0.
- `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('No esta en el rango')
```

This statement will print the string `'No esta en el rango'`.

Since the conditions specify that `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, the print statement will always execute and print the same string regardless of the specific value of `n` (as long as it meets the given constraints).

Output: **No esta en el rango**
