The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string. The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is: `print('##..##..')`.
2. This statement simply prints the string `'##..##..'` to the console.
3. The initial state variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`) do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because they are not referenced in the statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..##..**
