The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'##..'`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` must be greater than 2.
- `c` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.

None of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement, as the statement simply prints a hardcoded string.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **##..**
