The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'..##..##'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **..##..##**
