### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and iterates over each test case, reading the value of `n` for each one. This part of the program is correct.

2. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - The program provides hardcoded solutions for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`:
     - For `n = 1`, it prints a 2x2 checkerboard with all cells as `#`.
     - For `n = 2`, it prints a 4x4 checkerboard with the pattern `##..` and `..##` alternating.
     - For `n = 3`, it prints a 6x6 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##` and `..##..` alternating.
     - For `n = 4`, it prints an 8x8 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##..` and `..##..##` alternating.
   - These patterns match the expected output as described in the problem statement for these specific values of `n`.

3. **Pattern Matching**:
   - The patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` are correct and match the expected output.
   - However, the program does not handle values of `n` greater than 4. The problem statement specifies that `1 <= n <= 20`, so the program should be able to handle any value within this range.

4. **Generalization**:
   - The program lacks a generalized approach to generate the checkerboard for any `n` within the specified range. It only handles specific cases explicitly, which is a significant limitation.
   - The hardcoded solutions for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` are correct but do not cover the full range of valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all valid values of `n` (1 to 20) and only provides hardcoded solutions for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`. This limitation means the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Final: **False**
