The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is: `print('..##..##')`.
2. This statement simply prints the string `..##..##`.
3. The values of the variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because they are not referenced within it.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **..##..##**
