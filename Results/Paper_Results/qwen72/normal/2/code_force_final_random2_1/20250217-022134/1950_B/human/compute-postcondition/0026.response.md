The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string:

```python
print('##..##..')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides information about variables such as `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'##..##..'`.

### Explanation:
- The string `'##..##..'` is a fixed sequence of characters and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.
- Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'##..##..'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **##..##..**
