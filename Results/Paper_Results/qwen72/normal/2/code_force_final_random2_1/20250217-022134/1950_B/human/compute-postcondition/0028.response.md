The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string. Let's break down the initial state and the code to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- For each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is 0.
- The current value of `n` is 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('..##..##')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a fixed string `'..##..##'`.
- The initial state provides context about the variables `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The string `'..##..##'` is a literal string and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will simply print the string `'..##..##'`.

Output: **..##..##**
