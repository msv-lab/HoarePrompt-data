The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'##..##..'`.

- The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The string `'##..##..'` is a literal string and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the exact string `'##..##..'`.

Output: **##..##..**
