Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by handling specific cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). However, the problem statement requires the program to handle any \( n \) in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \), and the current implementation only handles up to \( n = 4 \). For values of \( n \) greater than 4, the program incorrectly prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern.

Additionally, the program does not follow the requirement to output the checkerboard for any valid \( n \) within the specified range. The checkerboard should be generated dynamically based on the value of \( n \), rather than hardcoding specific patterns for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to meet the requirements for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
