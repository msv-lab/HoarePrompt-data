Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) explicitly and fails to handle any other values of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For any value of `n` outside these four cases, the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This violates the problem description, which requires the program to generate a checkerboard for any valid `n` within the range. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
