To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `c` and `casos`.

- The variable `c` is the loop counter initialized by the `range(0, casos)` function.
- The variable `casos` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

For the loop to execute at least once, `casos` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `c` is 0, as specified by the range starting from 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `casos` is greater than 0 and `c` is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `casos` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
