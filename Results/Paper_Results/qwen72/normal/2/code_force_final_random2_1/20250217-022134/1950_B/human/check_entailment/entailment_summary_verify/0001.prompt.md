You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `casos` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ casos ≤ 20`. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`) and prints a pattern of `#` and `.` characters based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints a 2x2 grid of `##`. If `n` is 2, it prints a 4x4 grid with a specific pattern. If `n` is 3, it prints a 6x6 grid with a specific pattern. If `n` is 4, it prints an 8x8 grid with a specific pattern. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `casos` remains unchanged, and `n` retains its last input value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and iterates over each test case, reading the value of `n` for each one.

2. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - For `n = 1`, the program prints a 2x2 checkerboard with all cells as `#`.
   - For `n = 2`, the program prints a 4x4 checkerboard with the pattern `##..` and `..##` alternating.
   - For `n = 3`, the program prints a 6x6 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##` and `..##..` alternating.
   - For `n = 4`, the program prints an 8x8 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##..` and `..##..##` alternating.
   - For any other value of `n`, the program prints "No esta en el rango".

3. **Pattern Matching**:
   - The patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` match the expected output as described in the problem statement.
   - However, the program does not handle values of `n` greater than 4, which is a limitation. The problem statement specifies that `1 <= n <= 20`, so the program should be able to handle any value within this range.

4. **Generalization**:
   - The program lacks a generalized approach to generate the checkerboard for any `n` within the specified range. It only handles specific cases explicitly, which is not sufficient for the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all valid values of `n` (1 to 20) and only provides hardcoded solutions for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`.
