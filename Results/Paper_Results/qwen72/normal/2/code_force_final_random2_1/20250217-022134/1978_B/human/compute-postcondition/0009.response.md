Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `mid` is (0 + min(`n`, `b`)) // 2; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b); `max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`. Additionally, `profit_next` is less than or equal to `profit_mid`.**
