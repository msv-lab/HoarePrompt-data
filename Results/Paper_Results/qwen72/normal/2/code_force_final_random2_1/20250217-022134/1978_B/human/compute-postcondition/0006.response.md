The code snippet updates the value of `max_profit` to be the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `max_profit` was initially 0.
- `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
- The new value of `max_profit` will be the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`.

Since `profit_mid` is the result of a function call, we don't know its exact value, but we know it will be compared with 0, and `max_profit` will be updated accordingly.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_next`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `mid` is (0 + min(`n`, `b`)) // 2; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b); `max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`.**
