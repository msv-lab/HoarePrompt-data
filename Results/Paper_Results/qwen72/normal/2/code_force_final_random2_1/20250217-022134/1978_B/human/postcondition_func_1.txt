The function `func_2` accepts three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) and returns the maximum profit (`max_profit`). This profit is determined by iteratively calculating and comparing the profit at different points within a specified range, using a binary search approach. The final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and the returned `max_profit` represents the highest profit observed during the iterations.
