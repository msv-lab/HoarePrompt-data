Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
    profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
    max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
    if profit_next > profit_mid:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`; `high` is either the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`; `mid` is `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9. `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`, and `high` is either the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` is the maximum of 0, `profit_mid`, and the previous value of `max_profit`. `low` must be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `low` and `high` are updated based on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid`: if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `high` remains as the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1`; otherwise, `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of 0, `profit_mid`, and the previous value of `max_profit`. `low` must be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute one more time.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
