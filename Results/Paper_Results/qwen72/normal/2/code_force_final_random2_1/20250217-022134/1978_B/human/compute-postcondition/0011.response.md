Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`; `high` is either the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`; `mid` is `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1`.***
