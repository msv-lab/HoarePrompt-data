Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0; `mid` is (0 + min(`n`, `b`)) // 2.** 

In natural language: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain within their specified ranges, `low` remains 0, `high` is still the minimum of `n` and `b`, and `max_profit` remains 0. The new variable `mid` is calculated as half of the sum of `low` (which is 0) and `high` (which is the minimum of `n` and `b`), rounded down to the nearest integer.
