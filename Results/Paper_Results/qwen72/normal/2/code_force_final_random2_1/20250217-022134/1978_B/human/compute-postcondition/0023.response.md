Output State: **`profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1` depending on whether the new `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`, `high` is either the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1` depending on whether the new `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `max_profit` is the maximum of 0, `profit_mid`, and the previous value of `max_profit`. `low` must be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute one more time.**
