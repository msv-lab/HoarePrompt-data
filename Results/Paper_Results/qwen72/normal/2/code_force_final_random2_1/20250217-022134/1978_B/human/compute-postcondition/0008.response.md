Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1`; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `mid` is `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b); `max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`. Additionally, the current value of `profit_next` is greater than the current value of `profit_mid`.**

Explanation: The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, which is `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
