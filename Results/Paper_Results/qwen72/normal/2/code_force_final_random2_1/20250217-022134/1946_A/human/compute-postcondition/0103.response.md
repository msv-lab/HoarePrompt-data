Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to increment the median of the list until it exceeds its initial value. The function prints the number of operations for each test case. If any `n` exceeds 10000, the function immediately prints "1" and "16668" and terminates further processing for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the total number of test cases processed, the last input integer `n`, the last input list of integers, and the total number of operations performed across all test cases. **
