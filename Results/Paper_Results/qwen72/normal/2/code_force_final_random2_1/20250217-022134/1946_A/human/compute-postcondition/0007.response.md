The code snippet `res = a.count(a[p])` calculates the number of occurrences of the element at index `p` in the list `a`. The index `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, which is the middle index of the list `a` (considering zero-based indexing). Since `a` is a sorted list, the element at index `p` is the median of the list when `n` is odd, or one of the two middle elements when `n` is even.

The value of `res` will be the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.**
