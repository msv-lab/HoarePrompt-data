The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop is iterating a fixed number of times based on the value of `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, regardless of the values of other variables.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be incremented by 1, but since `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not affect the state. The loop will continue to execute until it has run `t` times.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for all variables except for the implicit increment of the loop counter, which is not explicitly tracked in the state.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`**.
