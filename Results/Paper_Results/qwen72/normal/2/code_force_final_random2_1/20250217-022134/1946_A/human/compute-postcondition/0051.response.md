To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition depends on `new_median` and `median`.

2. **Current State of Variables:**
   - `new_median` is equal to `median`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.

4. **Initial State:**
   - `new_median` is equal to `median`.

5. **Adjustment Needed:**
   - Since `new_median` is already equal to `median`, the loop condition `new_median <= median` is already satisfied.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed because the loop condition is already met with the current state.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `new_median` is equal to `median`.**
