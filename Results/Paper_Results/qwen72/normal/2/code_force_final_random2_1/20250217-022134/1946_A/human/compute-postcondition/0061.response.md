To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `num` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 2
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
- `b[ma]` is incremented by 1
- `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment
- `new_median` is equal to `median`

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `new_median` and `median`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `new_median` is initially equal to `median`, the loop will execute at least once.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `new_median` should remain less than or equal to `median` after the first iteration.

### Conclusion:
- No adjustments are needed to the current state because the loop condition `new_median <= median` is already satisfied.
