Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, `new_median` is equal to `median`.**

Explanation: The code `new_median = b[ma]` assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `b[ma]` was incremented by 1 before this assignment, `new_median` now holds the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, which is `median`. All other variables remain unchanged.
