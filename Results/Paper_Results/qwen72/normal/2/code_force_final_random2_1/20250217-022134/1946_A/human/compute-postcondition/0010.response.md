Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and this remains true after the code execution. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, and `res`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.
