Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`.** 

The list `a` has been sorted in ascending order, while the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `res` remain unchanged.
