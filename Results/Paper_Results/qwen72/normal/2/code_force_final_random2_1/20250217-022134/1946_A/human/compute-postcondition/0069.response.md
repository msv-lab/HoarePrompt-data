The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `num` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must still be greater than `i`, which means `num` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0. If `num2` > 10000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `op` is the number of iterations required for `new_median` to exceed `median`, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `b[ma]` is incremented by the number of iterations required for `new_median` to exceed `median`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before any increments, and `new_median` is equal to `median + 1`.**
