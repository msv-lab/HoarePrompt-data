The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `a` is now a list of integers, where each integer is read from the input.
- The length of the list `a` is `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers.**
