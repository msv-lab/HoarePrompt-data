Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `case = input()` assigns the user input to the variable `case`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the value of `case`, which is now an input string.
