The code snippet `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. Since `b` was already a sorted list of integers from `a`, this operation does not change the contents of `b`. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that `b` is explicitly confirmed to be sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case` where each element is a digit-only substring converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `median` is the new value of `b[ma]` plus 1, `new_median` is the new value of `b[ma]`.**
