Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, `new_median` is equal to `median + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b[ma] += 1` increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1.
- Before the increment, `b[ma]` was equal to `median`.
- After the increment, `b[ma]` is now `median + 1`.
- Since `new_median` is equal to `median`, after the increment, `new_median` should be updated to `median + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
