The code snippet assigns the value of `int(num2 / 2)` to the variable `ma`. This means `ma` will store the integer division result of `num2` divided by 2.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `num` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`

After executing the code:
- `ma` is assigned the value of `int(num2 / 2)`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.
