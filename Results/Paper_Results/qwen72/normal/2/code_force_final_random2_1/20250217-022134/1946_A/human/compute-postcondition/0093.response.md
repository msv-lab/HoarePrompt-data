To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `num` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 2
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`
- `new_median` is `median + 2`
- `b[ma]` is `median + 2`

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.
- Currently, `new_median` is `median + 2`, which means `new_median` is greater than `median`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `new_median` is currently `median + 2`, it is already greater than `median`.
- To make the loop condition `new_median <= median` true, we need to adjust `new_median` to be less than or equal to `median`.

However, the only way to adjust `new_median` is to change the value of `median` or the value of `new_median` itself. Since `median` is derived from the sorted list `b` and `b[ma]` is set to `median + 2`, changing `median` would require changing the list `b` or the index `ma`, which are not directly adjustable in the loop head.

Given the constraints, the only feasible adjustment is to set `new_median` to a value that is less than or equal to `median`. However, since `new_median` is defined as `median + 2`, this is not possible without changing the definition of `new_median`.

### Conclusion:
Since `new_median` is already greater than `median` and cannot be adjusted to be less than or equal to `median` without changing the definition, the loop will not execute again under the current conditions.
