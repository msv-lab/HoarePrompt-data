To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1.
- The input file has at least three lines.
- `line` is the first line of input data for the first test case.
- `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `elements`:**
   - `elements` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the first line of the input data (`line`) by whitespace.
   - For example, if `line` is `"a b c a b c a b c"`, then `elements` would be `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c']`.

2. **Set Comprehension `{*elements}`:**
   - `{*elements}` creates a set of unique elements from the list `elements`.
   - Using the example above, `{*elements}` would be `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - `elements.count(item)` counts how many times each unique element appears in the list `elements`.
   - For the example, `elements.count('a')` would be 3, `elements.count('b')` would be 3, and `elements.count('c')` would be 3.

4. **Integer Division by 3:**
   - `elements.count(item) // 3` performs integer division by 3.
   - For the example, `3 // 3` is 1 for each unique element.

5. **Summing the Results:**
   - The generator expression `sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements})` sums up the results of the integer divisions.
   - For the example, the sum would be `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the print statement will output the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique element in `elements` by 3.

Output: **3 (where 3 is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique element in `elements` by 3)**
