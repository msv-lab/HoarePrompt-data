The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which is derived from iterating over the list `cnt`. The state of `cnt` does not change between iterations; it remains the same list of integers. However, the value of `x` changes with each iteration as it takes on the next value in the list `cnt`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the current element in `cnt`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must take on the value of the next element in `cnt`.

Given that `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1`, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `cnt` to iterate over. Since the state of `cnt` itself does not change, the only adjustment needed is for `x` to move to the next element in `cnt`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `x` is now the next element in `cnt`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is 0 if `x` is 1 or less, otherwise `ans` is `x - 1`, `x` is the next element in `cnt`**
