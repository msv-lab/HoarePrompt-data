Output State: **`n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`, `_` is a placeholder for the current iteration in the range of the new input integer.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cnt` is reinitialized to a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial state.
