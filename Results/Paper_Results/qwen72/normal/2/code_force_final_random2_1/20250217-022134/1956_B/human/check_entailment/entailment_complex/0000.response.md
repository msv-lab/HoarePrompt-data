Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic implemented in the function `func` calculates the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique card number by 3, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, considering Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Counting the occurrences of each card number in your hand.
2. Determining how many pairs of cards you have (since each card number appears at most twice).
3. Calculating the maximum points you can score by playing optimally, knowing that Nene will also play optimally to counter your strategy.

The current implementation does not consider the optimal play strategy or the interaction between the two players' moves, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
