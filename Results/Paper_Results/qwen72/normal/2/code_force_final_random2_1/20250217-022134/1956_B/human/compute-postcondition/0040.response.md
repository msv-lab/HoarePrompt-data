To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the new input with all its elements processed.
   - `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.

2. **Understanding `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - Each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - For each element `x` in `cnt`, we compute `max(0, x - 1)`.
   - This means if `x` is 0 or 1, `max(0, x - 1)` will be 0.
   - If `x` is greater than 1, `max(0, x - 1)` will be `x - 1`.
   - We then sum up all these values to get `ans`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.

Given the initial state and the computation, the output will be the sum of the adjusted counts of each unique integer in the list `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for each x in cnt, and cnt is a list of length n + 1 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in a)**
