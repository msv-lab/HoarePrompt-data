Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. If the next character `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the previous `char` and the new `char`, and `letters` remains an empty list. If the next character `char` is not a digit, `digits` remains a list containing the previous `char`, and `letters` is a list containing the new `char`.** 

Explanation: The code `letters.append(char)` adds the new character `char` to the list `letters`. This means that if `char` is not a digit, `letters` now contains the new `char`, while `digits` remains unchanged. If `char` is a digit, the code does not affect `digits` or `letters` as described in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.
