The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, and the loop iterates over the `password` string. For the loop to execute, the `password` must be a non-empty string. Since the initial state specifies that `password` is a string of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, this condition is already met, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

However, since the loop iterates over each character in the `password`, and the initial state indicates that `password` is a valid string of the specified length, no adjustment is needed for the `password` itself. The variable `char` will take on the value of each character in the `password` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted beyond what is already given, as the conditions for the loop to execute are already satisfied.

State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**
