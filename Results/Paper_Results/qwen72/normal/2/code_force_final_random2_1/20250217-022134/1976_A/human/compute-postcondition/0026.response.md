The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `digits`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than the length of `digits`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order and must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `i` must still be less than the length of `digits`.

Since `i` was 0 at the end of the last iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `len(digits)`, meaning `digits` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`. Additionally, either `i` is not less than `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is not greater than `letters[i]`.**
