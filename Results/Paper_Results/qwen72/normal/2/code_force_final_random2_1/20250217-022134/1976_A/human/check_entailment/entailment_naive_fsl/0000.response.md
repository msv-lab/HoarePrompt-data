Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle a specific edge case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
1
5
a1b2c
```

Expected output:
```
NO
```

Actual output:
```
YES
```

The issue arises because the program does not correctly check if there is a digit that comes after a letter. In the `func_1` function, the logic to ensure that no digit comes after a letter is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is not sufficient to enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter. This condition only checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not the correct way to enforce the rule.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that once a digit appears, no letter follows it. This can be achieved by maintaining a flag to track whether a digit has been encountered and ensuring no letters appear after the first digit.
