The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 and must be greater than 0, after decrementing, `t` will now be an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2. The fact that `func_1()` has been called twice remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `func_1()` has been called twice, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
