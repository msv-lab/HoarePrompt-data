Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the element at index `k` set to 2, and the rest initialized with zeros; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 3; `i` is 0; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k`.** 

The value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
