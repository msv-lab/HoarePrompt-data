Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This is done in `func_2()`.

2. **Permutation Construction in `func_1()`**:
   - It reads the values of `n` and `k` for the current test case.
   - Initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - Uses a loop to fill the permutation array in a specific pattern:
     - For each index `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it fills the positions in the permutation array that are multiples of `k` plus `i` with consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by at most 1, satisfying the k-level permutation requirement.

3. **Output**: The constructed permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

The logic in `func_1()` ensures that the permutation is constructed in such a way that the sums of any k-length segments differ by at most 1, which meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
