The code snippet converts the list `permutation` into a string where each element of the list is converted to a string and then joined together with spaces. This string is then assigned to the variable `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `j` is set to the value `j // k + 1` if `j % k == 0`, otherwise it is set to the value `(j // k) * k + (j % k) + 1`.
- `curr_v` is `n + 1`.
- `i` is `k`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k * (n // k) + k - 1`.
- `idx` and `idx_v` remain unchanged at 0 and 1, respectively.

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `result` is assigned the string representation of the `permutation` list, with elements separated by spaces.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `j` is set to the value `j // k + 1` if `j % k == 0`, otherwise it is set to the value `(j // k) * k + (j % k) + 1`; `curr_v` is `n + 1`; `i` is `k`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k * (n // k) + k - 1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.**
