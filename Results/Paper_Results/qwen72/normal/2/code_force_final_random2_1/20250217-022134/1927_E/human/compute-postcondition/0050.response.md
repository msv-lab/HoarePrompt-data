Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros except for the elements at indices 1, k+1, 2*k+1, ..., (m-1)*k+1, which are set to m+1, m+2, m+3, ..., n-m; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 4 - m`; `i` is 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2*k`; `permutation[2]` is `n + 1 - m`; `permutation[2 + k]` is `n + 2 - m`; `permutation[2 + 2*k]` is `n + 3 - m`.**

Explanation:
- The code `curr_v += 1` increments the value of `curr_v` by 1.
- Initially, `curr_v` was `n + 3 - m`.
- After incrementing, `curr_v` becomes `n + 4 - m`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
