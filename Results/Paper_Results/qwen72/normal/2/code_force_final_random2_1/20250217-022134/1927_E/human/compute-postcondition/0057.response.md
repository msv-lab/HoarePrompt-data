Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a permutation of the first `n` natural numbers, placing them in a specific order based on the value of `k`. The resulting permutation is then printed as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the permutation list is populated with values according to the described logic. **
