The code snippet updates the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list to the value of `curr_v`. Let's break down the impact:

- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is defined as `2 + 2*k`.
- `curr_v` is defined as `n + 3 - m`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers with 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` with specific values at certain indices.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `n + 3 - m`.
- `i` is 2.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2*k`.
- `permutation[2]` is `n + 1 - m`.
- `permutation[2 + k]` is `n + 2 - m`.

After executing the code:
- The value at `permutation[2 + 2*k]` is updated to `n + 3 - m`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers with 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros except for the elements at indices 1, k+1, 2*k+1, ..., (m-1)*k+1, which are set to m+1, m+2, m+3, ..., n-m; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 3 - m`; `i` is 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2*k`; `permutation[2]` is `n + 1 - m`; `permutation[2 + k]` is `n + 2 - m`; `permutation[2 + 2*k]` is `n + 3 - m`.**
