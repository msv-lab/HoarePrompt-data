Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, the final state is as follows: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `j` is set to the value `j // k + 1` if `j % k == 0`, otherwise it is set to the value `(j // k) * k + (j % k) + 1`. The variable `curr_v` is `n + 1`, `i` is `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k * (n // k) + k - 1`. The variables `idx` and `idx_v` remain unchanged at 0 and 1, respectively.**
