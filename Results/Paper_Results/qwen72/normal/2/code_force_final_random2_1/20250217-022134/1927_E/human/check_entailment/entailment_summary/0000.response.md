### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even.
   - A k-level permutation ensures that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by at most 1.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
     - Initializes a permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
     - Fills the permutation list by placing numbers in a specific pattern based on `k`.
     - Ensures that the resulting permutation is a valid k-level permutation.
     - Prints the permutation as a space-separated string.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case `t` times.
     - Ensures that the function handles multiple test cases correctly.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Input Handling**: Both functions handle input correctly and within the specified constraints.
   - **Permutation Generation**: `func_1` generates the permutation by placing numbers in a way that ensures the k-level condition is met. The logic of placing numbers in multiples of `k` ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` will differ by at most 1.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The functions handle edge cases such as the smallest possible values for `n` and `k` (e.g., `n = 2`, `k = 2`).
   - The functions ensure that the permutation is valid and meets the k-level condition for larger values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a k-level permutation for each test case and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
