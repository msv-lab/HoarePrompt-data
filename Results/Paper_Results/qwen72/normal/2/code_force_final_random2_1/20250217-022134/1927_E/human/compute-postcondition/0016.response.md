Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the element at index `k` set to 2, the element at index `2 * k` set to 3, and the rest initialized with zeros; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 3; `i` is 0; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k`.**

Explanation:
- The code `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v` sets the element at index `2 * k` in the `permutation` list to the value of `curr_v`, which is 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
