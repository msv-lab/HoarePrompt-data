Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the element at index `k` set to 2, and the rest initialized with zeros; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 3; `i` is 0; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k`.
- The code `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` adds `k` to the current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i`.
- Therefore, the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + k`, which simplifies to `2 * k`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
