### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating a permutation of length `n` such that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any contiguous subarray of length `k` is at most 1.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with values `n` and `k`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - **Permutation Initialization**: It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - **Filling the Permutation**:
     - The outer loop runs `k` times, and the inner loop fills the permutation at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.
     - The variable `curr_v` keeps track of the current value to be placed in the permutation, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each placement.
   - **Output**: The function prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: It calls `func_1` for each test case, decrementing `t` each time until all test cases are processed.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Permutation Construction**: The permutation is constructed by placing values in a way that ensures the sums of contiguous subarrays of length `k` are balanced. The approach of filling the permutation at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i` ensures that the values are distributed evenly.
   - **Sum Balance**: By distributing the values in this manner, the sums of the contiguous subarrays of length `k` will have minimal differences, satisfying the `k-level` condition.
   - **Edge Cases**: The code handles the constraints correctly, including the case where `k` is even and `k <= n`.

5. **Verification**:
   - **Example Test Cases**:
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `2 1`. The sums are `2 + 1 = 3`, and the difference is `0`.
     - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the output is `1 3 2`. The sums are `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`, and the difference is `1`.
     - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the output is `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`. The sums are `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`, `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`, `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`, `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`, `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`, `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`, `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`, and the difference is `1`.

Given the above reasoning and verification, the program appears to correctly generate a `k-level` permutation for the given problem constraints.
