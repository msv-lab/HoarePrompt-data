The code snippet updates the `permutation` list by setting the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to the value of `curr_v`. Let's break down the impact:

- `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1, so `permutation[1]` is set to `curr_v`.
- `curr_v` is `m + 1`.

Therefore, the element at index 1 in the `permutation` list is set to `m + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros except `permutation[1]` which is now `m + 1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m + 1`; `i` is 1; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.**
