### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Calls:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - This part is correctly implemented in `func_2()`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - In `func_1()`, the program reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the `permutation` list in a specific pattern using a nested loop. The outer loop runs `k` times, and the inner loop fills the `permutation` list at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.

3. **Pattern Explanation:**
   - The pattern ensures that the sum of any contiguous subarray of length `k` will have a difference of at most 1 between the maximum and minimum sums.
   - This is achieved by distributing the values in a way that balances the sums across the subarrays.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation, the program converts the list to a string and prints it.
   - This part is also correctly implemented.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible values of `n` and `k` (e.g., `n = 2`, `k = 2`).
   - It also handles larger values within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a `k`-level permutation for each test case as described in the problem statement. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program meets all the requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
