Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the element at index `k` set to 2, the element at index `2 * k` set to 3, and the rest initialized with zeros; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 4; `i` is 0; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `3 * k`.**

Explanation: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was initially `2 * k`. After executing the line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k`, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `3 * k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
