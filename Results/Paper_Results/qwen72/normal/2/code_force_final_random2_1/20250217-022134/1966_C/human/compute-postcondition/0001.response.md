To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `tc` and `t`.

- `t` is the number of test cases, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `tc` is the loop variable that starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is not explicitly initialized, but it will be managed by the `range(t)` function.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `tc` will start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
