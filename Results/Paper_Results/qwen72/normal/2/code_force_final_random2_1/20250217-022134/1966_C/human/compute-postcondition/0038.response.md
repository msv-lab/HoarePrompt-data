Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input and must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 2 or 3 depending on whether `sz` was equal to `maxsize` initially.** 

Explanation: The code snippet increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Initially, `mexsize` could be 1 or 2 based on the condition that if `sz` is equal to `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is 2; otherwise, it remains 1. After the increment, `mexsize` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or 3 if it was initially 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
