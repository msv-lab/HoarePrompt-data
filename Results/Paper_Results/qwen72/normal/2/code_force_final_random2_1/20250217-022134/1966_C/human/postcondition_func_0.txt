The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of piles with a specified number of stones. For each test case, it determines the smallest positive integer (mex) not present in the list of stone counts. It then prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on whether the mex is even or odd, considering the maximum stone count in the piles. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
