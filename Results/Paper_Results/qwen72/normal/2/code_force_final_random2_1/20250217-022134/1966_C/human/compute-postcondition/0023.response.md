Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.***
