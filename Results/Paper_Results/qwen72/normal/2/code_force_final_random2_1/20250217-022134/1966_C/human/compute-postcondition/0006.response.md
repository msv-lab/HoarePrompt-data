The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, or `maxsize`. However, the order of elements in the list `a` changes.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**
