To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `tc` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

2. **Key Points:**
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, it means that all elements in `a` are distinct and in increasing order.
   - `maxsize` is the largest number in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a` and is greater than `maxsize`.

3. **Condition in the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `mexsize % 2 == 0` (i.e., if `mexsize` is even).
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Bob'.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and is greater than `maxsize`, it must be a positive integer.
   - Given that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, and `maxsize` is the largest number in the list `a`, `mexsize` could be any positive integer greater than `maxsize`.
   - The parity (even or odd) of `mexsize` depends on the specific values in the list `a` and the value of `maxsize`.

However, without the exact values of the list `a` and `maxsize`, we cannot definitively determine whether `mexsize` is even or odd. But we can describe the output based on the condition:

- If `mexsize` is even, the output will be 'Alice'.
- If `mexsize` is odd, the output will be 'Bob'.

Since the exact value of `mexsize` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition:

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is even, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and is greater than `maxsize`)**
