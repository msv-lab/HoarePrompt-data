Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `tc` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mexsize` Calculation**:
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not in the list.
   - Given that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize`.

2. **Parity of `mexsize`**:
   - If `maxsize` is even, then `mexsize` (which is `maxsize + 1`) will be odd.
   - If `maxsize` is odd, then `mexsize` (which is `maxsize + 1`) will be even.

3. **Condition in the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement checks if `mexsize % 2 == 0` (i.e., if `mexsize` is even).
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Bob'.

### Conclusion:
- Since `mexsize` is `maxsize + 1`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` will be even if `maxsize` is odd, and odd if `maxsize` is even.
- Therefore, the print statement will print 'Alice' if `maxsize` is odd, and 'Bob' if `maxsize` is even.

However, without knowing the exact value of `maxsize`, we can only determine the parity of `mexsize` based on the parity of `maxsize`.

### Final Output:
Output: **'Alice' if `maxsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob'** (where `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`).
