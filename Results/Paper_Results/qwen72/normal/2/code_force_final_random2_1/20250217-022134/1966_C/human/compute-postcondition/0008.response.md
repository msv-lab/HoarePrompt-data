The only object in the loop head is the variable `sz` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. The state of `sz` will be the first element of the list `a` when the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `tc` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head)
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `mexsize` is 1 (not relevant to the loop head)

To ensure the loop executes, `a` must have at least one element, and `sz` will be the first element of `a`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`**
