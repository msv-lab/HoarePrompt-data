To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object `a` in the loop head. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`
- `mexsize` is 1
- If `a` is empty, `maxsize` and `mexsize` are defined, with `mexsize` being 1

We need to ensure that `a` is not empty for the loop to execute. Therefore, `a` must contain at least one element.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1**
