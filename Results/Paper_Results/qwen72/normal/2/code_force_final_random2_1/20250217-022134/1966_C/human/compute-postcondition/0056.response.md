The only objects in the loop head are the variable `sz` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`, and `a` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `sz` will be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`. If `sz` (the second element of `a`) is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is updated to 2.**
