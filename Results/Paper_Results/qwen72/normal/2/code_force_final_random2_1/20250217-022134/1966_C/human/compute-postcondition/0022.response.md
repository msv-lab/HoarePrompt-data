Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `tc` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement checks the condition `mexsize % 2 == 1`.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Bob'.

4. **Determine the Value of `mexsize`:**
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the smallest positive integer not in `a` can be determined by checking the sequence of numbers starting from 1.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 2, 4, 5]`, then `mexsize` would be 3 because 3 is the smallest positive integer not in the list.

5. **Parity of `mexsize`:**
   - The parity (odd or even) of `mexsize` depends on the specific values in the list `a`.
   - However, since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in the list, it can be either odd or even.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Without the exact values of the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `mexsize`.
   - However, we know that `mexsize` is a positive integer and can be either odd or even.

Given the condition in the print statement, the output will depend on whether `mexsize` is odd or even. Since we don't have the exact value of `mexsize`, we can only describe the output based on the condition:

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
