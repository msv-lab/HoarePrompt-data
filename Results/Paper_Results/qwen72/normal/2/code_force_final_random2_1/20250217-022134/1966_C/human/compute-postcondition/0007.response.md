Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1.** 

The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `mexsize`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment while maintaining the initial conditions of the other variables.
