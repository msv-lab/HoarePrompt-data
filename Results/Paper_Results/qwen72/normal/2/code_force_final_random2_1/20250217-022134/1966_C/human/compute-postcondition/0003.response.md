The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`.

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `tc` remains 0.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
