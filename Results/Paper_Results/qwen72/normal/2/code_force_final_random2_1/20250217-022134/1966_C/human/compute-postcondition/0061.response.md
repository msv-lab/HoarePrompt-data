Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`. If `sz` is equal to 1, `mexsize` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 2.***
