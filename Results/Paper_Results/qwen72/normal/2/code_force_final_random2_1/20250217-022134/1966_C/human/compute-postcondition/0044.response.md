Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `tc` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mexsize`**:
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is missing from this list.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3, 5]`, then `mexsize` would be 4 because 4 is the smallest positive integer not in the list.

2. **Condition in the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement checks if `mexsize % 2 == 1`.
   - This means it checks if `mexsize` is an odd number.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Bob'.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, it can be either odd or even.
- However, the exact value of `mexsize` depends on the specific list `a`, but we know it must be a positive integer and less than or equal to `maxsize`.

Given that `mexsize` can be either odd or even, the output will depend on the parity of `mexsize`.

### Final Output:
Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
