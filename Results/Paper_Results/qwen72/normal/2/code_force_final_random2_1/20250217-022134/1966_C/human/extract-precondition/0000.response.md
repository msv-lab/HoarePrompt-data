Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles. Each pile has an integer a_i such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
