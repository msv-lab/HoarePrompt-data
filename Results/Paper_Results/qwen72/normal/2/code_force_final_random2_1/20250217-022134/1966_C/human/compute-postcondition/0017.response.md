Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the next element in the list `a` after the current `sz`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged.***
