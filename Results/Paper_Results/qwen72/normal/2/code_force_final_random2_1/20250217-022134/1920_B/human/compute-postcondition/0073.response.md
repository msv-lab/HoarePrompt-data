The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` initially contains the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`.

After executing the code, the value of `sums` is appended to `ans`, making `ans` a list with two identical elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
