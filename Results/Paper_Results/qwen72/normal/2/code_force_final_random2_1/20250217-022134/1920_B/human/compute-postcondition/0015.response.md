The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation modifies the list `ans` by adding one more element to it, which is the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least -1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is not 0, `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
