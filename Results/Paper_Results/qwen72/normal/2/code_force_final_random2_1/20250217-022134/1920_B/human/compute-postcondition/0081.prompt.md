Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 0 or not 0. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing one element `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the value `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 1, and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and the new value of `sums` is appended to `ans`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and the new value of `sums` is appended to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 2, and `ans` is a list containing the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`. If `i == 0`, `ans` is updated to contain the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` is updated to contain the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]]`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to contain the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1]]`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
