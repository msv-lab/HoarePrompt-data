Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `k + 1`.
- The list `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements.
- The first element of `ans` is calculated as the total sum of the original list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the reversed list `a`.
- Each subsequent element in `ans` is calculated based on the previous value of `sums` and the current and future elements of the reversed list `a`, depending on whether the condition `i + x - 1 < n` is met. If it is, the element is adjusted by adding the previous element and subtracting twice the future element. If it is not, the element is adjusted by just adding the previous element.
