Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated list `ans` which now contains one element, the value of `sums`.
