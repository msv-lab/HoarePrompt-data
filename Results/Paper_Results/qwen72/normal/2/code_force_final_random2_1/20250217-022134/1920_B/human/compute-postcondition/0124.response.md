Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the inner loop. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and subsequent elements are updated based on the conditions: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, if `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. The final output is the maximum value in the list `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `_` will be equal to `t - 1` because the loop starts with `_` at 0 and increments by 1 each time.
- For each test case, the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` are read from the input and remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- The list `a` is sorted in descending order and remains the same for each test case.
- The variable `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a` and remains unchanged.
- The list `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the inner loop.
- The first element in `ans` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- Subsequent elements in `ans` are updated based on the conditions inside the inner loop.
- The final output for each test case is the maximum value in the list `ans`.
