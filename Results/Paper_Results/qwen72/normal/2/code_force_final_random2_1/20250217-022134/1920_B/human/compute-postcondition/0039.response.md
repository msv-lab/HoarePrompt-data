Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is 2. If `i == 0`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0]`, and `sums + a[1]`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`.***
