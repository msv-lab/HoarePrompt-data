Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is 1. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` is a list containing two elements: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing two elements: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0]`.**
