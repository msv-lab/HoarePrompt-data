Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` now includes the new value `sums` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- The value of `_` remains 1.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
- The value of `k` remains an input integer that must be at least 0.
- The value of `x` remains an input integer.
- The list `a` remains a reversed list of integers from the input.
- The value of `sum1` remains the sum of all elements in the original `a`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- The list `ans` now includes the new value `sums` appended to it.
