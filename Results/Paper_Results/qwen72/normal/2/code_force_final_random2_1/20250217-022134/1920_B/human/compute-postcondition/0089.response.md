Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list, overriding its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`) remain unchanged.
