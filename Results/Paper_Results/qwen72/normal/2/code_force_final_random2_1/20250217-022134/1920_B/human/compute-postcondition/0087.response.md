The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a`. This means that the order of the elements in `a` is reversed, but the elements themselves remain the same. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `i`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation.

Let's break down the impact:

- `a` is now a reversed list of the original `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `i`, and `ans`) retain their initial values.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.**
