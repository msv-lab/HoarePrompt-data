The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.**
