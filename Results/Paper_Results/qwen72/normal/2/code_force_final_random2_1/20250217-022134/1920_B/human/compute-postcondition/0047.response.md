Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, starting with `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and updating based on the conditions within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code `sum1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `sum1`.
- The initial state already specifies that `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input.
- The value of `sum1` is now the sum of all elements in the original `a` (before it was reversed).
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
