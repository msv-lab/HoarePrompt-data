The given code updates the value of `sums` based on the current value of `i`, the list `a`, and the value of `x`. Let's break down the impact:

- `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.
- The value of `i` is assumed to have been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed.
- The list `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, so the elements are in descending order.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`.

After executing the code:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
