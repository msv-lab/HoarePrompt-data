The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `k + 1`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, and the condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `k + 1`. Therefore, for the next iteration:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must still be less than `k + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k + 1` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated based on the conditions described in the task.**
