The given code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` must be at least 1
- `x` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`
- `i` is 2
- `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are calculated based on the conditions provided
- `sums` is also calculated based on the conditions provided

The code snippet:
```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `i` is 2.
2. `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]` (since `i - 1` is 1).
3. `a[i + x - 1]` is `a[1 + x - 1]` which simplifies to `a[x]`.

Thus, the new value of `sums` is:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are calculated based on the conditions provided, `sums` is now `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`.**
