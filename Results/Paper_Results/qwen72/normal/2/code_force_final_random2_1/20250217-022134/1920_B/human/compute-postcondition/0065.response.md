The given code updates the value of `sums` based on the current values of `a`, `i`, and `x`. Specifically, it adds the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracts twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]` from `sums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0
- `x` is an input integer
- `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- If `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing one element `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`
- If `i` is not 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sums`
- If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`
- Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

### Impact of the Code:
1. **`sums`**: The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
2. **Other Variables**: The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `i` remain unchanged.

### Calculation:
- The new value of `sums` is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{new\_sums} = \text{sums} + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
  \]

### Output State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0
- `x` is an input integer
- `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`
- `ans` remains the same (if `i` is 1, it contains `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`; if `i` is not 1, it contains the value `sums`)

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` remains the same**.
