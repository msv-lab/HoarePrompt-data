To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
   - `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.
   - `_` is a placeholder for the current iteration in the range of the new input integer.
   - `x` is the last element of `cnt`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the length of the list `a` minus 1 (since `cnt` is of length `n + 1`).
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cnt` is a list where `cnt[i]` is the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
   - `ans` is calculated by taking each element `x` in `cnt` and computing `max(0, x - 1)`, then summing these values.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - For each element `x` in `cnt`, if `x` is greater than 1, `max(0, x - 1)` will be `x - 1`. If `x` is 1 or 0, `max(0, x - 1)` will be 0.
   - Therefore, `ans` is the sum of `(x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` where `x > 1`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.

Given the initial state and the operations described, the output will be the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for each x in cnt)**
