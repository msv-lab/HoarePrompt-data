Output State: **`n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`, `_` is a placeholder for the current iteration in the range of the new input integer.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains the same as the initial input integer greater than 0.
- **`a`**: The list of integers from the new input remains unchanged.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt` will have been updated such that `cnt[i]` contains the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
- **`ans`**: This variable is calculated as the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`. Since `cnt` is updated based on the occurrences of each integer in `a`, `ans` will reflect the sum of these adjusted counts.
- **`_`**: This is a placeholder for the current iteration in the range of the new input integer and is not relevant to the final state of the variables.
