Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`.
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - Each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

2. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - For each element `x` in `cnt`, we compute `max(0, x - 1)`.
   - This means if `x` is greater than 1, we subtract 1 from it; otherwise, we take 0.
   - We then sum all these values to get `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `n = 5` and `a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]`.
- The list `cnt` will be initialized as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (length `n + 1`).
- After counting the occurrences:
  - `cnt[1] = 1` (one occurrence of 1)
  - `cnt[2] = 2` (two occurrences of 2)
  - `cnt[3] = 1` (one occurrence of 3)
  - `cnt[4] = 3` (three occurrences of 4)
  - `cnt[5] = 0` (no occurrences of 5)
- So, `cnt` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0]`.

3. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - `max(0, 0 - 1) = 0`
   - `max(0, 1 - 1) = 0`
   - `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1`
   - `max(0, 1 - 1) = 0`
   - `max(0, 3 - 1) = 2`
   - `max(0, 0 - 1) = 0`
   - Summing these values: `0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 3`

### General Case:
- For any given `n` and `a`, the value of `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.
- This essentially counts the number of elements in `a` that appear more than once, minus one for each such element.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`, which represents the number of elements in `a` that appear more than once, minus one for each such element.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for each x in cnt, representing the number of elements in a that appear more than once, minus one for each such element)**
