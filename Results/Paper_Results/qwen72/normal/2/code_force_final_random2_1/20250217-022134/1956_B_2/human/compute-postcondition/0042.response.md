Output State: **`n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the new input with all its elements processed, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`, `_` is a placeholder for the current iteration in the range of the new input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer greater than 0.
- The variables `a`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `_` retain their previous definitions and values, as they are not affected by the assignment of `n`.
