Functionality: ** The function reads and processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cards. For each test case, it reads the number of cards each player receives (n) and the numbers on the cards (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). It then calculates and prints the number of cards that can be removed such that no card number appears more than once in the player's hand. The function processes all test cases specified by the initial input and prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. **
