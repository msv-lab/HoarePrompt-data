The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `cnt`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cnt`. The loop iterates over each element in `cnt`, and for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element left in `cnt` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the current element in `cnt`, and `cnt` had elements remaining. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will be the next element in `cnt`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is updated to `ans + max(0, x - 1)`, `x` is the next element in `cnt`**
