Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must contain at least one element (but now with one less element), `suma` is `min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the new first element that was removed from `numbers`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns its integer value to `b`.
- The list `numbers` now has one less element.
- The variable `a` retains its previous value, which is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers` before this operation.
- The variable `b` is updated to the integer value of the new first element that was removed from `numbers`.
- All other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `suma`) remain unchanged.
