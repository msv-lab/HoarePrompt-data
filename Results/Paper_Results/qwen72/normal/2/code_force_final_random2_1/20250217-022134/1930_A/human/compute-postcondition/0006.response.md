The only object in the loop head is the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` is not an empty list, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `numbers` is described as a sorted list of strings in ascending order. For the loop to execute at least once, `numbers` must contain at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order and contains at least one element, `suma` is 0**
