To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head, which is `numbers != []`. This means the loop will execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `numCases` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `numInteger` is an input integer
- `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order
- `suma` is 0

The only variable in the loop head is `numbers`. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must not be an empty list. Since the problem does not specify the current state of `numbers`, we need to ensure that `numbers` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is to ensure that `numbers` is not an empty list. The other variables do not affect the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must not be empty, `suma` is 0**
