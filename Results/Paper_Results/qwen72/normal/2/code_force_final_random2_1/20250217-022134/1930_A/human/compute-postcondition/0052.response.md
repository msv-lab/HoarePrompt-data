Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must not be empty (but now missing its first four elements), `suma` is `min(b, a)`, `a` is the integer value of the third element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the fourth element that was removed from `numbers`.** 

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns its integer value to `b`. Since `numbers` initially had its first three elements removed, the first element being popped here is actually the fourth element that was originally in the list. The values of `t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `a`, and `suma` remain unchanged. The list `numbers` now has its first four elements removed.
