Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order with two fewer elements, `suma` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning this value to `b`.
- Since `a` was already the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers` before this code, and now `b` is the integer value of the next element removed, `numbers` now has two fewer elements.
- All other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `suma`) remain unchanged.
