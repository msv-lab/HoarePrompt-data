To determine what will be printed when the `print(suma)` statement is executed, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `numCases` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `numInteger` is an input integer.
- `numbers` is an empty list.
- `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list until the list is empty.

### Analysis:
1. **`numbers` List**: Initially, `numbers` is an empty list.
2. **`suma` Calculation**: Since `numbers` is empty, there are no pairs of integers to take from it. Therefore, the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from an empty list is 0.

### Conclusion:
When the `print(suma)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `suma`, which is 0 because `numbers` is empty and there are no pairs to sum.

Output: **0**
