Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must not be empty (but now missing its first six elements), `a` is the integer value of the fifth element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the sixth element that was removed from `numbers`, `suma` is `2 * min(a, b)`**

Explanation:
- The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the `numbers` list and assigns its integer value to `b`.
- Initially, `numbers` was missing its first five elements, so the first element being popped now is the sixth element that was originally in the list.
- The value of `a` remains the integer value of the fifth element that was removed from `numbers`.
- The value of `b` is now the integer value of the sixth element that was removed from `numbers`.
- The value of `suma` is calculated as `2 * min(a, b)`, which remains unchanged because the values of `a` and `b` have been updated.
- All other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`) remain unchanged.
