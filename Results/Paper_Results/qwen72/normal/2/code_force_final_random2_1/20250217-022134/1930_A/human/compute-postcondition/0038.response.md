Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must contain at least one element (but now with one less element), `suma` is `min(a, b) + min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the new first element that was removed from `numbers`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `suma` is `min(a, b) + min(a, b)`.
- The code snippet `suma += min(a, b)` adds `min(a, b)` to `suma`.
- Therefore, the new value of `suma` is `min(a, b) + min(a, b) + min(a, b)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `numbers`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
