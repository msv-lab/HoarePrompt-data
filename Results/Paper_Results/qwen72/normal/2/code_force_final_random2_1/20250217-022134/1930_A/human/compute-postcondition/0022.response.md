Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.**

The code snippet `numInteger = int(input())` assigns the value of `numInteger` to the integer input provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
