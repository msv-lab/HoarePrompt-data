The code snippet sorts the list `numbers` in ascending order. The sorting does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.**
