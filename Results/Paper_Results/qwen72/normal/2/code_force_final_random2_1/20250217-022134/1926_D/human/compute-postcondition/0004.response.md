The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `data`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, the list of integers `a_1, ..., a_n` consists of non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `data` is a list of integers from the input.**
