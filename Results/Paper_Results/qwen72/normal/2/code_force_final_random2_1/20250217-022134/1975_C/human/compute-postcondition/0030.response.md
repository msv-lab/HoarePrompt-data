Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, and `max` is the maximum of the minimum values found or 0 if no such value was found. If the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.***
