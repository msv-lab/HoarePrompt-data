Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2. If the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is greater than `max` (which is either 0 or the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`), then `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains as it was after the previous iteration.***
