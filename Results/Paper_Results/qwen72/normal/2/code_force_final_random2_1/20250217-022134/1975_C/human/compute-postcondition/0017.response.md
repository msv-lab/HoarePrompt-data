The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (the loop counter), which is used in the `range(t)` expression. The loop will execute as long as there are iterations left based on the value of `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once but has not completed all its iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, and the loop counter `_` will increment by 1.

Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked in the state, we focus on the condition that allows the loop to continue, which is that `t` must be greater than 0. However, since the loop counter is implicit in the `range(t)` function, we do not need to explicitly state the value of `_` in the state. Instead, we recognize that `t` is decremented implicitly with each iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is still greater than 0, but it is now one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum of the minimum values of consecutive pairs of elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`**. 

(Note: Since `t` is the only variable that changes in the loop head, and it is implicitly decremented, the other variables remain the same.)
