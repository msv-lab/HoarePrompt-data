Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
            max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum of the minimum values of consecutive pairs of elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum of the minimum values found between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, or 0 if no such value was found.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum of the initial `max` and the minimum values between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
