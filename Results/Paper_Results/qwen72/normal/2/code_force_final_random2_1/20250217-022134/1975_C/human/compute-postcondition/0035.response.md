Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum of the minimum values found between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, or 0 if no such value was found.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `max` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `a` is now a list of integers based on the user's input.
