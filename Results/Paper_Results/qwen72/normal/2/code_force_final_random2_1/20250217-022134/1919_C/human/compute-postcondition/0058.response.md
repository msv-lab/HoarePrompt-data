Output State: **`a` is the value of `l[x]`, `c` is 1 more than its previous value if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` (previously) and `b`; otherwise, `c` remains 0, `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, or `l[x]` if the if condition is not met, `x` is incremented by 1, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `a` is updated to the value of `l[x]`.
- The conditions for updating `c` and `b` remain the same as in the initial state, as they depend on the new value of `a` and the existing value of `b`.
- `x` is incremented by 1.
- `y` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial values.
