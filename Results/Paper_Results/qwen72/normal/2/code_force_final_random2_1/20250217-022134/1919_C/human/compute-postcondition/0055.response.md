Postcondition: ***`a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition. `c` is 1 if `l[x]` (or `l[x-1]` in the else case) is greater than both the previous `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0. `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, or `l[x]` if the if condition is not met. `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met. `n` remains unchanged.***
