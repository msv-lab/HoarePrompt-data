Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 2`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `b` and `c` remain as they were before the loop started. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is the element at index `x` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `b` is now equal to `l[y + 2]`.**
