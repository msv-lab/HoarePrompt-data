Postcondition: **`a` is the first element of `l`, `c` is 0, `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, and `y` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute, `x` starts from `y + 1`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`. Additionally, `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`.**
