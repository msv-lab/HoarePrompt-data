To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **_ is incremented by the total number of iterations**: This indicates that there is a loop or some form of iteration happening, but it doesn't directly affect the value of `c`.

2. **`n` remains the same**: `n` is the length of the list `l`.

3. **`l` remains the same**: `l` is a list of elements.

4. **`x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`)**: `x` is the index of the last element in the list `l`.

5. **`y` remains the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` or `n - 1` if no such index exists**: `y` is the smallest index in the list `l` where the element at `y` is greater than the element at `y - 1`. If no such index exists, `y` is set to `n - 1`.

6. **`a` is the final value of `a` after all iterations**: `a` is updated during the iterations, but its final value is not specified in the initial state.

7. **`b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations**: Similarly, `b` is updated during the iterations, but its final value is not specified in the initial state.

8. **`c` is the total count of updates to `a` or `b` where `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b` or `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`**: `c` counts the number of times both `a` and `b` are updated based on the condition involving the element at index `x`.

Given these conditions, the value of `c` depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and the elements in the list `l`. However, without the exact values of `a`, `b`, and the elements in `l`, we can only describe `c` in terms of the conditions provided.

### Explanation:
- `c` is the count of updates to `a` and `b` where the element at index `x` (the last element of `l`) is either greater than both `a` and `b` or less than both `a` and `b`.
- Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and the elements in `l` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `c`.

### Final Output:
Output: **c (where c is the total count of updates to a or b where l[x] > a and l[x] > b or l[x] < a and l[x] < b)**
