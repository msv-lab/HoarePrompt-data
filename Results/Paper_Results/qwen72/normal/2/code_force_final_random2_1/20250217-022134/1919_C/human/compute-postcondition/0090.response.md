The code snippet `b = l[y]` assigns to `b` the value of the element in the list `l` at index `y`. Given that `y` is 3, `b` will be assigned the value of the fourth element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is 3, `b` is the fourth element of `l`, `c` remains unchanged.**
