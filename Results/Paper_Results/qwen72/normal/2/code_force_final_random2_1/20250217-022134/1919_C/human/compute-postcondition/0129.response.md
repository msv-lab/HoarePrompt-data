Postcondition: **_ is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 2`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated and is less than `n - 1`, `b` remains as it was before the loop started. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is the element at index `x` in the list `l` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is now equal to `l[y + 2]`. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then `a` is the value of `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is now equal to `l[x]` and `c` remains unchanged.**
