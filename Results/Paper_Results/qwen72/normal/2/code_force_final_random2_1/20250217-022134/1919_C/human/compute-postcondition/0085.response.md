The only variables in the loop head are `y` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `y` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `y`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is 2**
