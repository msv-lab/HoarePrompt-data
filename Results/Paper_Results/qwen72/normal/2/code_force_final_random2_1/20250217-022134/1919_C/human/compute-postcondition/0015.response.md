Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `y` is 2, `l` is a list of integers from the input line, `a` is the first element of `l`, and `c` is 0. If `l[1]` is greater than `l[0]`, then `b` is set to `l[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
