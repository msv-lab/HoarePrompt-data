Postcondition: ***`a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is 1 if `l[x]` (or `l[x-1]` in the else case) is greater than both the previous `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0, `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, `x` is `x + 1`, and `n` remains unchanged.***
