Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is 2. If `l[y]` (which is `l[2]`) is greater than `l[y - 1]` (which is `l[1]`), `b` is set to the third element of `l`, `c` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `b` and `c` remain unchanged.***
