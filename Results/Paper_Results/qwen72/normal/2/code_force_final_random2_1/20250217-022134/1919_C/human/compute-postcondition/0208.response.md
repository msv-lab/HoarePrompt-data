Output State: **`x` is `y + 3`, `n` must be greater than `y + 3`, `a` is `l[y + 3]`.**

Explanation:
- `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` is now `y + 3`.
- `n` must be greater than `y + 3` (this condition remains unchanged).
- `a` is assigned the value of `l[x]`, which is `l[y + 3]` since `x` is `y + 3`.
