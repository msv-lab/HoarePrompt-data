Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `x` is `y + 1`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `b` is now equal to `l[x]`, `c` remains as it was before the loop started. Additionally, the current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is also greater than the previous value of `b`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the previous value of `b`.**
