Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 1`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `c` remains as it was before the loop started. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, and `l[x]` is greater than the previous value of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`, and `l[x]` is greater than `a` and the previous value of `b`. In both cases, `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `b`.***
