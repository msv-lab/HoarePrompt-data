The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `y + 3`, `n` is greater than `y + 3`, and either `a` or `b` is the element at index `y + 3` in list `l`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is the element at index `y + 3` in list `l`. Otherwise, `b` is the element at index `y + 3` in list `l`. `c` is increased by 1.**
