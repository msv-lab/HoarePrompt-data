Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 1`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `c` remains as it was before the loop started. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than the original `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than the original `a` and the new `b`.**
