Postcondition: ***`x` is `y + 3`, and `n` is greater than `y + 3`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then either `a` or `b` is the element at index `y + 3` in list `l`, and `c` is increased by 1. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then either `a` is set to `l[y + 3]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[y + 3]`. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 3]`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 3]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 3]`.***
