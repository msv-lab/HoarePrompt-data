Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` and `y < n - 1` if such an index exists, otherwise `y` is `n - 1`, `a` is the first element in `l` if `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, otherwise `a` is `l[x]` depending on the condition `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])`, `b` is `l[y]` if `l[y] > l[y - 1]` for some `y` and `l[x] >= b`, otherwise `b` is `l[x]` depending on the same condition, and `c` is 0. Additionally, either `l[x]` is not greater than `a` or `l[x]` is not greater than `b`.**
