Output State: **`a` is the first element of `l` or `l[x-1]` depending on the condition, `c` is 1 if `l[x-1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0, `b` is `l[x]`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, `x` is `x + 1`, `n` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `l[x]`.
- The value of `x` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `a`, `c`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `c` remains the same, but now it checks if `l[x-1]` (the previous value of `l[x]`) is greater than both `a` and the new value of `b`.
