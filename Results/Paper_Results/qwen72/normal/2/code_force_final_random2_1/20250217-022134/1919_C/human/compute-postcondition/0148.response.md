Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, which is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, if such an element exists; otherwise, `b` remains 0, `c` is the count of how many times the condition `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b` was true during the loop.**
