The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`.

Given the initial state:
- The input must be a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4)
- `n` is the input integer

After executing the code, the list `l` will contain the integers from the input line.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input line.**
