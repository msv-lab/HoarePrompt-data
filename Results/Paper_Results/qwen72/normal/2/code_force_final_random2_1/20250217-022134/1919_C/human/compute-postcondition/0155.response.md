Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer that must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is 1, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the second element in `l`, `c` is 0, and the second element of `l` (`l[1]`) is greater than the first element of `l` (`l[0]`). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
