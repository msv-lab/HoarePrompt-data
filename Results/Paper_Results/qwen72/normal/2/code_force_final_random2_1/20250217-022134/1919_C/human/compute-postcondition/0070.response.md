Postcondition: ***`a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is 1 more than its previous value if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` remains 0, `b` is either 0, the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, or `l[x]` if the if condition is not met, `x` is incremented by 1, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, and `n` remains unchanged.***
