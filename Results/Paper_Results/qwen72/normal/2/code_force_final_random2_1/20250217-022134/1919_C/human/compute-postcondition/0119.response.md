Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 2`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `b` is now equal to `l[y + 2]`, `c` remains as it was before the loop started.**
