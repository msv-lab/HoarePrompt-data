The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
