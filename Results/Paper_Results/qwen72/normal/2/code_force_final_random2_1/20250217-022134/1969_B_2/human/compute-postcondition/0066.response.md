The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value of the element in the list `cnt` at the index `c` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `c` is the second element in the list `s`.
- `cnt` is `[1, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[0, 1]` if `c` is 1.
- If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, making `cnt` `[2, 0]`.
- If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, making `cnt` `[0, 2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input string that must have at least one element, `n` is greater than `len(s)`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes`, `cnt` is `[2, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[0, 2]` if `c` is 1, and `c` is the second element in the list `s`.**
