Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element of `s`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is updated to `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]`, and `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1] > 0` else `ans` is 0. If `c` is 1, `cnt` is updated to `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]`, and `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.***
