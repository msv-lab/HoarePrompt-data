The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts each character of the resulting string into an integer, storing these integers in a list `s`.

- `s` is updated to a new list of integers derived from the input string.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of times 0 appears in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of times 1 appears in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the number of times 0 appears in `s` when there is at least one 1 before it, plus the number of times 1 appears in `s` multiplied by the number of times 0 appears in `s` minus the number of times 0 has been counted so far, `n` is now `n - 1`.**
