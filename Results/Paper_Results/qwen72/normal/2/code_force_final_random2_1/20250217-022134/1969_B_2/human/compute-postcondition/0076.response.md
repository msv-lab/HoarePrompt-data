To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `ans` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of a new input string.
   - `n` is greater than `len(s)`.
   - `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`.
   - `cnt` is a list `[zeroes, len(s) - zeroes]`, where `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s and `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in the list `s`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the number of times a 1 appears before each 0 in the list `s` plus the total number of 0s multiplied by the number of 1s.

2. **Computation of `ans`:**
   - The first part of `ans` is the sum of the number of times a 1 appears before each 0 in the list `s`.
   - The second part of `ans` is the total number of 0s multiplied by the number of 1s.

Let's denote:
- `num_ones_before_zeros` as the sum of the number of times a 1 appears before each 0 in the list `s`.
- `total_zeros` as the total number of 0s in the list `s`.
- `total_ones` as the total number of 1s in the list `s`.

Then:
\[ \text{ans} = \text{num\_ones\_before\_zeros} + (\text{total\_zeros} \times \text{total\_ones}) \]

3. **Explanation:**
   - `num_ones_before_zeros` is computed by iterating through the list `s` and counting the number of 1s before each 0.
   - `total_zeros` is the count of 0s in the list `s`.
   - `total_ones` is the count of 1s in the list `s`.

Given the initial state, the `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` as calculated above.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the number of times a 1 appears before each 0 in the list s plus the total number of 0s multiplied by the number of 1s)**
