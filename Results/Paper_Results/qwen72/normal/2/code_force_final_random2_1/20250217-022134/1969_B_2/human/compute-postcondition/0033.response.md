Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element of `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]` if `c` is 1, or `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0, `ans` is 0, `n` is now `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the digit `c` in the list `cnt`.
- Since `c` is the first element of `s`, and `s` contains only 0s and 1s, `c` can only be 0 or 1.
- If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
