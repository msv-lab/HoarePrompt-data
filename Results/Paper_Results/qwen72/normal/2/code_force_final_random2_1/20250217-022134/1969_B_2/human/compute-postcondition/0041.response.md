Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least 1 element, `c` is the second element of `s`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is now `cnt[c] + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `c`, `n`, `zeroes`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific value of `cnt[c]` after the increment depends on its initial value, which is not provided, so we express it as `cnt[c] + 1`.
