The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of times 0 appears in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of times 1 appears in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the number of times 0 appears in `s` when there is at least one 1 before it, plus the number of times 1 appears in `s` multiplied by the number of times 0 appears in `s` minus the number of times 0 has been counted so far, `n` is now `n - 1`**
