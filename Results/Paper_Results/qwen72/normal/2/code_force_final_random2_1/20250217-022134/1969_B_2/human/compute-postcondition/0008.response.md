The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `c` is the first element of the list `s`, and `cnt` is initially `[0, 0]`, the value at the index `c` in `cnt` will be incremented by 1.

Let's break down the impact:

- `cnt` is a list `[0, 0]`.
- `c` is the first element of the list `s`.
- The value at the index `c` in `cnt` is incremented by 1.

If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1, making `cnt` `[1, 0]`.
If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1, making `cnt` `[0, 1]`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least one element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[1, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[0, 1]` if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of the list `s`.**
