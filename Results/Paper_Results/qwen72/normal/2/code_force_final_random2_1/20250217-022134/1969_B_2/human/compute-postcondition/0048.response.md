Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least 2 elements, `c` is the third element of `s`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is now `cnt[c] + 1`, `ans` is now `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `c`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt[c]`) retain their values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
