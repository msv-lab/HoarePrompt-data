Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`.** 

Explanation: The variable `zeroes` is assigned the count of how many times the digit 0 appears in the list `s`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
