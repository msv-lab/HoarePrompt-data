Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input string that must have at least two elements, `n` is greater than `len(s)`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[0, 3]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the third element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 0. If `c` is 1, `ans` is `2 * zeroes + 1`. If `c` is 0 (in the else part), `ans` is `zeroes - 3`. If `c` is 1 (in the else part), `ans` is `3 * zeroes`.***
