Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution, `t`, `z`, `k` remain unchanged, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `R` is `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `R = x` updates the value of `R` to be equal to the current value of `x`.
- Since `x` is defined as `(L + R) // 2`, the new value of `R` is now `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `k`, `x`, `leftover`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged.
