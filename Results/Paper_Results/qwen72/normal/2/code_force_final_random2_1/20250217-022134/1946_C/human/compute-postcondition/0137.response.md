Functionality: ** The function reads a series of inputs from standard input and processes them to determine a specific value `L` for each test case. It accepts no explicit parameters but relies on input from `sys.stdin`. For each test case defined by the integer `t`, it reads pairs of integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n-1` pairs of integers `a` and `b` which represent edges in a graph. The function constructs an adjacency list for the graph and uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of `L` that satisfies certain conditions related to the number of cuts (`numCuts`) and a leftover value from a depth-first search (DFS) operation. The function prints the value of `L` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. **
