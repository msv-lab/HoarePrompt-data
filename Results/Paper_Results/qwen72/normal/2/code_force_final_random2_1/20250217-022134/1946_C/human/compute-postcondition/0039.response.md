Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, the loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` is `n - 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`. If `L` was 50001 and `R` was 100001, then `x` is 75001. If `L` was 1 and `R` was 50001, then `x` is 25001.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `numCuts = 0` reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, `i`, `leftover`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `x` depends on the values of `L` and `R`, which are given as conditions in the initial state.
