Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers read from the input respectively, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `adj` as a list of empty lists, with the length of the list being `n + 1`. This means `adj` now contains `n + 1` empty lists. All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
