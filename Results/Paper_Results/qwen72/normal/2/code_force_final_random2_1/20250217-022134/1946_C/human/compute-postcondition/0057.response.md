The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `i < n - 1` to hold true.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (and `b` is appended again), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements (and `a` is appended again)**
