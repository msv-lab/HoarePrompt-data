The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This updates the values of `a` and `b` to the new integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers read from the input, respectively, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `adj[a]` now contains the value `b`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `a`.**
