The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. These integers are within the range 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is at least 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers read from the input, respectively.**
