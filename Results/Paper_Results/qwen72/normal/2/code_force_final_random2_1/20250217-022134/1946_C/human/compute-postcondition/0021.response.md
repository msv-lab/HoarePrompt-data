The value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the value of `x` is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which simplifies to `100002 // 2`, resulting in `50001`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, and each list in `adj` contains the indices of nodes connected to the corresponding node. The loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**
