The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be at least 3 for `i` to be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers read from the input, respectively, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `adj[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to its existing list, `adj[b]` now contains the value `a` appended to its existing list.**
