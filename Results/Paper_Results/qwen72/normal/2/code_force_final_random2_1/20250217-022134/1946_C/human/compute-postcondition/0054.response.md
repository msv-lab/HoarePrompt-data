Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now updated to the new integers read from the input. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `adj[a]`, and `adj[b]`) remain unchanged. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 2 and that `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other as elements are still valid.
