The code snippet reads a line from standard input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 1. After executing the code, the values of `a` and `b` are set based on the input, while `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.**
