Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `n-2`:** The loop iterates `n-1` times, so after the last iteration, `i` will be `n-2`.
- **`n` is greater than 1:** For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.
- **`a` and `b` are the integers read from input:** These are the values read during each iteration of the loop.
- **`adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times:** Each time the loop runs, `b` is appended to `adj[a]`. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `b` will be appended `n-1` times.
- **`adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times:** Similarly, each time the loop runs, `a` is appended to `adj[b]`. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `a` will be appended `n-1` times.

All other variables (`k`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
