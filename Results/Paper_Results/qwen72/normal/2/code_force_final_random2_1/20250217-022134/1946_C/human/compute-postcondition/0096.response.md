Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.** 

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `adj[a]` still includes `b` as one of its elements.
