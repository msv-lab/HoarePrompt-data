Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001), then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is 0.***
