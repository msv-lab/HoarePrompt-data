Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and a, b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop continues to narrow down the range between `L` and `R` until `R - L <= 1`. At this point, `L` will be the largest integer such that the conditions `numCuts <= k` and (`numCuts < k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < x`)) are satisfied. The final values of `L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`. The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `k`) remain unchanged, `L` is the largest value such that the condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is false, `R` is the smallest value such that the condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is true, and `numCuts` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `L` is the maximum value such that the condition `numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` holds true, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
