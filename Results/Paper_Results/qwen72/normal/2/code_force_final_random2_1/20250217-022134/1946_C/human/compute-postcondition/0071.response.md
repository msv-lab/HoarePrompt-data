Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution, `t`, `z`, `k` remain unchanged, `L` is now 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).***
