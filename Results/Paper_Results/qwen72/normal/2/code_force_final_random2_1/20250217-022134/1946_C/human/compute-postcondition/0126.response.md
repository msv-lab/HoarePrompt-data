The value of `x` is updated to the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Based on the initial state, there are two possible scenarios for `L` and `R`:

1. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 25001), then `L` is 25001 and `R` is 50001. In this case, `x` becomes `(25001 + 50001) // 2 = 37501`.
2. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 25001. In this case, `x` becomes `(1 + 25001) // 2 = 12501`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `L` and `R` remain unchanged, and `x` is either 37501 or 12501 depending on the conditions for `L` and `R`.**
