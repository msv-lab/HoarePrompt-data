Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, and each list in `adj` contains the indices of nodes connected to the corresponding node. The loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, and each list in `adj` contains the indices of nodes connected to the corresponding node. The loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` is `n - 2`, `numCuts` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` is greater than `k`, or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and either `numCuts` is less than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`), then `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, the loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` is `n - 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, and `x` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `x` and `x` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. If `L` was 50001 and `R` was 100001, then either `L` is 75001 or `R` is 75001 and `x` is 62501. If `L` was 1 and `R` was 50001, then either `L` is 25001 or `R` is 25001 and `x` is 12501.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, the loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` is `n - 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `x`. If `L` was 50001 and `R` was 100001, then either `L` is 75001 or `R` is 75001. If `L` was 1 and `R` was 50001, then either `L` is 25001 or `R` is 25001.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
