Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 25001), then `L` is 25001 and `R` is 50001, otherwise `L` is 1 and `R` is 25001.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, `L`, and `R`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `L` and `R` remain as specified in the initial state.
