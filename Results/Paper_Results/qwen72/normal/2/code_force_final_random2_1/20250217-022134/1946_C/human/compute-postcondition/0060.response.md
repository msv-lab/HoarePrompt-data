Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` twice as its elements, `adj[b]` now contains `a` three times as its elements.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`.
- Initially, `adj[b]` contained `a` once.
- After executing the code, `adj[b]` now contains `a` three times.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
