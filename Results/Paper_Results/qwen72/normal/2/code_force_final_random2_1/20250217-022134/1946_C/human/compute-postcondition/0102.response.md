Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` twice, `adj[b]` now includes `a` twice.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` still contain their respective values as described in the initial state.
