The code reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k` after converting them to integers.

Output State: **`L` and `R` are such that `R = L + 1`, `t` is greater than the new value of `z`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `z` is incremented by 1, `a`, `b`, `adj`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
