Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution, `t`, `z`, `k` remain unchanged, `x` is now `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is now `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `L = x` assigns the value of `x` to `L`.
- `x` was previously defined as `(L + R) // 2`.
- Therefore, `L` is now equal to `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `k`, `leftover`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged.
