The code `adj[a].append(b)` adds the element `b` to the list `adj[a]`. This means that `b` is added to the existing elements in `adj[a]`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `a` and `b` are the integers read from input
- `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements
- `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements

After executing the code, the only change is that `b` is appended to `adj[a]`, which already includes `b`. Therefore, `b` is now listed twice in `adj[a]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` twice, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.**
