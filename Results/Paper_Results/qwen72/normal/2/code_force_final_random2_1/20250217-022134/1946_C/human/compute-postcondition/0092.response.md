Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is updated to the first integer read from the input, `k` is updated to the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `t` remains unchanged, `z` is `z + 1`, `L` is the largest value such that the condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is false, `R` is the smallest value such that the condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is true, and `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `adj` as a list of `n + 1` empty lists. This means that `adj` now contains `n + 1` sublists, each of which is initially empty.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `R`, and `numCuts`) retain their previous values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
