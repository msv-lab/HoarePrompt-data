Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and a, b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value read from the standard input, which is within the range 1 to 10^4. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
