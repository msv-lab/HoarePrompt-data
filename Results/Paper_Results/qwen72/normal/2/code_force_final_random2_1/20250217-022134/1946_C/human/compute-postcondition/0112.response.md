Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.** 

Explanation: The code snippet calls the `dfs(1, 1)` function and assigns its return value to the variable `leftover`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `x` remain unchanged. The new variable `leftover` is introduced and holds the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.
