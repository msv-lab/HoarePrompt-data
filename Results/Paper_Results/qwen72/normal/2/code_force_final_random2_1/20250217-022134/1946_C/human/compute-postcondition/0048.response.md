Output State: **`L` and `R` are such that `R = L + 1`, `t` is greater than the new value of `z`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `z` is incremented by 1, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `adj` as a list of `n + 1` empty lists.
- The values of `L`, `R`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `z`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The only change is that `adj` now contains `n + 1` empty lists.
