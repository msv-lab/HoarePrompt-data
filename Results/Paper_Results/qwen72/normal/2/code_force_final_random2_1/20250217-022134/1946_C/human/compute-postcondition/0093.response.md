To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(n - 1)` generates at least one value.
   - For `range(n - 1)` to generate at least one value, `n - 1` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state of `i` is `n-2`, but this is not relevant to the loop head. The loop will set `i` to 0 on the first iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- `i` will be set to 0 by the loop on the first iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
