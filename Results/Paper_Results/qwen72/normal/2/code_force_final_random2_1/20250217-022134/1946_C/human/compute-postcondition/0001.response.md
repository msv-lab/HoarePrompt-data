The only variable in the loop head is `z`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, this condition is inherently satisfied. However, for the loop to start, `z` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n**
