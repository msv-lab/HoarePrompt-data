Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is 25001 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 25001), otherwise `L` is `(L + R) // 2` and `R` is 50001.**

Explanation:
- The value of `L` is updated to `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`.
- The value of `R` remains unchanged unless the condition `numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= 25001)` is met, in which case `R` is set to 25001. Otherwise, `R` remains 50001.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, and `x`) retain their initial values.
