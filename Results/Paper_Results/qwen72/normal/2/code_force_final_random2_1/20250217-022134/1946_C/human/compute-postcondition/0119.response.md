The value of `x` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. We need to determine the values of `L` and `R` based on the conditions given:

- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001), then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001.
- Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is 0.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001:
   - `x = (50001 + 100001) // 2 = 150002 // 2 = 75001`

2. If `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001:
   - `x = (1 + 50001) // 2 = 50002 // 2 = 25001`

Therefore, the value of `x` will be either 75001 or 25001 depending on the values of `numCuts` and `leftover`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `x` is 25001 if `numCuts` is 0, otherwise `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, and `x` is 75001.**
