Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 25001, `x` is 25001.**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to the value of `x`, which is 25001.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
