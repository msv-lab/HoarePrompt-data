To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `(n, m, k, a, b)` from the `cases` list. For the loop to execute, the `cases` list must contain at least one tuple. Additionally, each tuple must meet the specified conditions for `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases.
- Each element in `cases` is a tuple containing three elements: `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even), followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6) of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.
- The sum of values `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, the `cases` list must have at least one valid tuple. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `cases` contains at least one tuple, and the first tuple must meet the specified conditions.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains valid `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as described, and `cases` must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list**.
