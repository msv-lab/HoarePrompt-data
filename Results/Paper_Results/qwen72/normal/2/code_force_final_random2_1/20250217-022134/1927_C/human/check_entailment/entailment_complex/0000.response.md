Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem statement and handles the input and output as specified. It processes each test case by identifying the unique elements in both arrays `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. It then checks the following conditions:
1. The number of elements in `a` that are not in `b` and are less than or equal to `k` should not exceed `k // 2`.
2. The number of elements in `b` that are not in `a` and are less than or equal to `k` should not exceed `k // 2`.
3. The total number of distinct elements (including those that are in both `a` and `b`) that are less than or equal to `k` should be at least `k`.

If all these conditions are met, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO". This logic ensures that the program correctly determines whether it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from each array such that every integer from 1 to `k` is included.

The program also handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, ensuring that it works within the given limits and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
