The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This operation modifies the `results` list by adding a new element to it. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains valid `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as described, and `cases` must have at least one tuple, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO', `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, and the total number of distinct elements (`total_distinct`) is less than `k`.**
