The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
  - `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even).
  - Two lists of integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6) of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.

The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `cases`. Each 'YES' indicates that the conditions for the corresponding test case are met, while each 'NO' indicates that they are not. The conditions involve checking the uniqueness and overlap of elements in lists `a` and `b` relative to the value `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function returns a list `results` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the conditions for the corresponding test case are met based on the uniqueness and overlap of elements in `a` and `b` relative to `k`.**
