Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains valid `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as described, and `cases` must have at least two tuples, `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES', `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a` of the next tuple, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` of the next tuple, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` of the next tuple that are less than or equal to `k` of the next tuple, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` of the next tuple that are less than or equal to `k` of the next tuple, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` of the next tuple that are not in `relevant_b` of the next tuple, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` of the next tuple that are not in `relevant_a` of the next tuple, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` of the next tuple, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` of the next tuple, `unique_a` is now a set containing the unique elements from the list `a` of the current tuple.**
