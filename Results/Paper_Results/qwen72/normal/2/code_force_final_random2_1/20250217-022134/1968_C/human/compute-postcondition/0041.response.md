The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a` has a new element appended which is the result of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration (as it starts from 1 and the loop has just completed its first iteration), the new value of `i` will be 2. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `a` has a new element appended which is the result of `a[1] - T[1]`, `i` is 2**
