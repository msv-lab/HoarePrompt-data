The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` converts the string `line` into a list of integers by splitting the string at spaces and converting each split part into an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, and it satisfies 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `x_2, ..., x_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500.
- The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `n` is now an input integer.
- `line` is a string containing user input.

After executing the code:
- `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and the constraints on `n` and `x_i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, and it satisfies 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `x_2, ..., x_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is now an input integer. `line` is a string containing user input. `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line`.**
