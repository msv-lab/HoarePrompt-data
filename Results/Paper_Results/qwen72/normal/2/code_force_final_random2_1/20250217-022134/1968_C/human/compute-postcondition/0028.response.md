Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` has an additional element equal to `a[1] - T[1]`, `a` has an additional element equal to `a[0] - T[0]`, and `a` has an additional element equal to `a[2] - T[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a` which is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, the new element appended to `a` is `a[2] - T[2]`. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
