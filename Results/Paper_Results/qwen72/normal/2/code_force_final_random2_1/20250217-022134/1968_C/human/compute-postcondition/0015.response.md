The code snippet `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts each element of the list `a` to a string, joins these strings with a space `' '` as the separator, and assigns the resulting string to the variable `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `a` has the same `n` elements but in reverse order.

After executing the code, the list `a` is converted to a string where each element is separated by a space. The variable `result` now holds this string.

Output State: **`n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` has the same `n` elements but in reverse order, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**
