The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` processes the input string `line` by splitting it into substrings based on spaces, converting each substring to an integer, and storing these integers in a list `T`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `a` contains `n` elements where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, but now `a` is reversed.
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
- `t` is a truthy value decreased by 1.
- `line` is the new input string.
- The other variables (`T`) remain unchanged.

After executing the code:
- `T` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the input string `line`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` contains `n` elements where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, but now `a` is reversed, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `line` is the new input string, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line`.**
