Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` contains `n` elements where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, and the other variables (`result`, `t`, `line`, `T`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the variable `n` still holds the original input integer value. The variable `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last value it takes before the loop exits. The list `a` will now contain `n` elements, with the first element being the initial value `1000`, and each subsequent element being the difference between the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in the list `T`. All other variables that were not modified within the loop (such as `result`, `t`, `line`, and `T`) will retain their initial values.
