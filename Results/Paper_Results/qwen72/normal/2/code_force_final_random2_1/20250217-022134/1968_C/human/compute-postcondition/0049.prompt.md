Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x_2, ..., x_n are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
    a = a[::-1]
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` has the same `n` elements but in reverse order, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` contains `n` elements where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, but now `a` is reversed, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, and the other variables (`t`, `line`, `T`) remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `a` will have `n-1` additional elements appended to it, each element being the result of the subtraction `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` for each iteration `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The list `a` is now reversed. The variables `result` is now a string containing the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces. The variables `t` and `line` remain unchanged, and `T` remains the original list of integers derived from the input string `line`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
