The function reads a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of `n` integers such that each element (except the first) is derived by subtracting the corresponding element from the input list from the previous element in the sequence. The sequence is then reversed, and the function prints the reversed sequence as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with no return value. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed, and the results have been printed.
