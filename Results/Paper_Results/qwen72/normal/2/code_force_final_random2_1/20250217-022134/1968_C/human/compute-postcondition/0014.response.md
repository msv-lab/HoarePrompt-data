The code snippet `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. This means that the order of the elements in `a` is reversed, but the values of the elements themselves remain the same.

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `a` has `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`.

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` is reversed. Therefore, the new state of the variables is:

- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `a` now has the same `n` elements, but in reverse order. The first element of the original `a` becomes the last element of the new `a`, the second element of the original `a` becomes the second-to-last element of the new `a`, and so on.

Output State: **`n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` has the same `n` elements but in reverse order.**
