Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` has an additional element equal to `a[1] - T[1]`, and `a` has an additional element equal to `a[0] - T[0]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`, which simplifies to `a[1] - T[1]` because `i` is 2. The initial state already mentioned that `a` has an additional element equal to `a[0] - T[0]`. After executing the given code, `a` now has two additional elements: one equal to `a[0] - T[0]` and another equal to `a[1] - T[1]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
