Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of `x` values.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes the list `a` with a value of 1000. This is intended to be the starting point for constructing the array `a`.

3. **Array Construction**:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, which is correct since we need to construct `a` from `a_1` to `a_n`.
   - Inside the loop, the function appends `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to the list `a`. This is incorrect because the relationship `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` should be satisfied, not `a_i = a_{i-1} - x_i`.

4. **Reversing the List**: After constructing the list `a`, it reverses the list. This is unnecessary and incorrect because the list should be constructed in the correct order from the beginning.

5. **Output**: The function prints the list `a` as a space-separated string, which is correct for the output format.

### Correct Approach:
To satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`, we need to ensure that `a_i` is chosen such that when divided by `a_{i-1}`, the remainder is `x_i`. One way to achieve this is to set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` or a multiple of `a_{i-1}` plus `x_i`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input()
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]  # Start with a large enough value
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a.append(a[i] + T[i])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: We start with `a_1 = 1000` (or any large enough value).
- **Array Construction**: For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, we set `a_i = a_{i-1} + T[i-1]`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = T[i-1]`.
- **Output**: The list `a` is printed as a space-separated string.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly construct the array `a` to satisfy the given conditions. The corrected program provided above should work correctly.
