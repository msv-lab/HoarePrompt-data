Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing the array `a` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. However, the logic used in the program to construct `a` is flawed. Specifically, the line `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` does not correctly compute the required values of `a` to satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`. One way to achieve this is to set `a_i` to be a value that is greater than `a_{i-1}` and satisfies the modulo condition. A simple approach is to set `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i`.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `a` with a single element `[1000]`. This initial value is arbitrary and does not necessarily help in constructing the correct array `a`.

2. **Loop through the elements**: The program iterates through the elements of `T` (which represents `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`) and appends `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` to the list `a`. This operation does not ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`.

3. **Reversing the list**: The list `a` is reversed at the end, which is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

4. **Output**: The program prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

Correctness: **False**
