The code snippet `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as the difference between the element at index `i-1` of `a` and the element at index `i-1` of `T`. Given that `i` is 3, the new element is `a[2] - T[2]`.

Since `a` already had an additional element appended which was the result of `a[1] - T[1]`, the list `a` now has one more element appended, making the new element the result of `a[2] - T[2]`.

The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 3, and `i` is 3. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` has two additional elements, the first being `a[1] - T[1]` and the second being `a[2] - T[2]`.**
