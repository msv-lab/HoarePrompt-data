Output State: **t is an integer input by the user, and it satisfies 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x_2, ..., x_n are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `t` is `t - 1`.
- Since the initial value of `t` was between 1 and 10^4, the new value of `t` will be between 0 and 10^4 - 1.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
