The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count` was 2 if `char` is "+", and 1 if `char` is "-". After the increment, `count` will be 3 if `char` is "+", and 2 if `char` is "-". The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string of length `length` (1 ≤ length ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `char` is the third character of `expression`, if `char` is "+", `count` is 3; otherwise, `count` is 2.**
