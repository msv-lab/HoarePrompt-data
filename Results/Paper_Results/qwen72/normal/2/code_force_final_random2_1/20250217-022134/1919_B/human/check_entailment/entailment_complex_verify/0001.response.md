Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not solve the problem as intended. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not align with the requirement to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - The goal is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as \( | \text{sum of elements} | \times \text{length of subarray} \).

2. **Program Behavior:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
   - It then returns the absolute difference between these counts.
   - This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

3. **Optimal Solution:**
   - To minimize the total penalty, the optimal strategy is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum as close to zero as possible.
   - This can be achieved by ensuring that each subarray has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, or as close to equal as possible.

4. **Example Validation:**
   - For the input `"+-+-+-"`, the optimal split would be `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a total penalty of \(0 + 0 + 0 = 0\).
   - The given program would return `0` (since there are 3 '+' and 3 '-' characters), but this is coincidentally correct for this specific input. However, it does not generalize to all inputs.

5. **General Case:**
   - For the input `"--+++++++-"`, the optimal split would be `([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, resulting in a total penalty of \(4\).
   - The given program would return `4` (since there are 8 '+' and 2 '-' characters), but again, this is not a general solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
