Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. To minimize the penalty, one effective strategy is to ensure that the sum of each subarray is zero whenever possible, which means balancing the number of `+` and `-` characters within each subarray.

However, the provided solution does not implement any logic to split the array into subarrays. Instead, it simply counts the number of `+` and `-` characters in the entire string and returns the absolute difference between these counts. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty, which is a critical part of the problem statement.

The correct approach would involve iterating through the string and dynamically forming subarrays to balance the number of `+` and `-` characters, thereby minimizing the penalty. The current implementation fails to address this requirement and thus does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
