### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as intended. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as \( | \text{sum of elements} | \times \text{length of subarray} \).
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`.
   - It calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.
   - The function returns this absolute difference.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach of counting the number of '+' and '-' characters and returning their absolute difference does not address the problem of minimizing the total penalty.
   - To minimize the total penalty, the optimal strategy is to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - This can be achieved by ensuring that each subarray has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, or as close to equal as possible.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the optimal split would be `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a total penalty of \(0 + 0 + 0 = 0\).
   - The provided program would return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is correct for this specific case but does not generalize to all cases.

5. **General Case:**
   - For a general case, the program's approach of simply counting the characters and returning their absolute difference does not ensure the optimal splitting of the array.
   - For example, for the input `--+++++++`, the optimal split would be `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, resulting in a total penalty of \(2 + 5 = 7\).
   - The provided program would return `abs(1 - 9) = 8`, which is not the minimum possible penalty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
