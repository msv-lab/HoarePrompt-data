Reasoning:  
The program's logic does not align with the requirements of the problem statement. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array optimally, but the program simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of "+" and "-" characters in the string. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which involves more complex logic to ensure that the sum of penalties of the subarrays is minimized.

For example, in the case where the input string is `"+-+-+"`, the program would return `0` because the number of "+" and "-" characters is equal. However, the optimal way to split this array to minimize the penalty is to split it into `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1]`, which results in a penalty of `0` for each subarray, leading to a total penalty of `0`. While the program happens to return the correct answer in this specific case, it does not guarantee the correct answer for all cases.

A correct solution would need to consider how to split the array to minimize the penalty, which might involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal splits.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
