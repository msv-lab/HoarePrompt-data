Output State: **`n` is now `n - i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * n + n // i`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is 1, and `n` is updated to `n - i * (n // i)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated by adding the value of `curr` to it. Since `curr` is `n // i` and `i` is 1, `curr` is simply `n`.
- Therefore, `h` becomes `2 * n + n // i`, which simplifies to `2 * n + n` because `n // i` is `n` when `i` is 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
