Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is `curr`; `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is an unspecified positive integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`.
- The value of `curr` remains `n // i`, where `i` is an unspecified positive integer.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
