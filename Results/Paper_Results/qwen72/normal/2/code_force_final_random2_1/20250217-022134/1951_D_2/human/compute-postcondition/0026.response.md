Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - `n` is less than `k`.
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`.
   - `h` is the sum of the initial value of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
   - `curr` is 0.
   - `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - The initial value of `n` is 0.
   - The elements in `costs` are `[1 - k, 1]`.
   - `h` is calculated as the sum of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
   - Since `n` is 0, the division of 0 by any non-zero number is 0.
   - Therefore, `h = 0 / (1 - k) + 0 / 1 = 0 + 0 = 0`.

3. **Conditions:**
   - `h` is less than `k`, which is true because `h` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement: `print('NO')`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print` statement will execute and print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
