The code snippet `curr = n // i` assigns the floor division result of `n` divided by `i` to the variable `curr`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `curr`. However, we know that `curr` will be the largest integer less than or equal to the result of `n / i`.

The initial state provides:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k.
- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is 0.

After executing the code snippet, the only change is the assignment of `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0; `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is an unspecified positive integer.**
