To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k.
- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the `costs` list.
- For the loop to execute, the `costs` list must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The `costs` list already contains two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once because the list is not empty.
- The variable `i` will take the values of the elements in the `costs` list during each iteration.

### Final State:
Since the `costs` list is already defined and contains two elements, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes. The state remains as follows:

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0**.
