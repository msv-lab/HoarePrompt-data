Output State: **`n` is now `n - i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `curr`, `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is an unspecified positive integer.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `i * curr` from its current value. Since `curr` is defined as `n // i`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - i * (n // i)`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
