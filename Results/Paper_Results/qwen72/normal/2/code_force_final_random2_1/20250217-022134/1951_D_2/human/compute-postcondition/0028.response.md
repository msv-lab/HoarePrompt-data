Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - `n` is less than `k`.
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`.
   - `h` is the sum of the initial value of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
   - `curr` is 0.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - The initial value of `n` is 0.
   - The elements in `costs` are `[1 - k, 1]`.
   - `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
   - Since `n` is 0, `n / (1 - k)` is 0 and `n / 1` is 0.
   - Therefore, `h = 0 + 0 = 0`.

3. **Checking the condition `h >= k`:**
   - According to the initial state, `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - However, from our calculation, `h` is 0, which contradicts the condition `h >= k` unless `k` is also 0, but `k` is a positive integer.

Given the contradiction, it seems there might be an inconsistency in the initial state. However, for the purpose of this task, we will assume the initial state as provided and proceed with the given code snippet.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(2)
   ```

The code snippet simply prints the integer 2. The values of the variables and objects do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **2**
