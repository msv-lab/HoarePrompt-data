You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of up to 1000 test cases, where each test case involves a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each test case, the function checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. If the string contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' followed by either the string `s` sorted in descending order (if `s` is already sorted in ascending order) or the string `s` sorted in ascending order (if `s` is not already sorted in ascending order). After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - It creates a set `a` from the string `s` to check the uniqueness of characters in `s`.

3. **Check for Unique Characters:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it proceeds to the next steps.

4. **Sorting and Reversing:**
   - It sorts the string `s` to get `b` and sorts it in reverse order to get `c`.
   - This ensures that `b` and `c` are two different permutations of `s`.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it prints the reversed string `c` to ensure the output is different from `s`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness for Single Character Strings:**
  - If all characters in `s` are the same, the program correctly outputs 'NO'.
- **Correctness for Multiple Character Strings:**
  - For strings with more than one unique character, the program ensures that the output is different from the input by either sorting the string or reversing the sorted string.
  - This approach guarantees that the output string `r` is different from the input string `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that for strings with multiple unique characters, it outputs a different permutation, and for strings with a single unique character, it correctly reports 'NO'.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
