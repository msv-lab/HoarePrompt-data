Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the string `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character. Otherwise, `b` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is already sorted in ascending order, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input string `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character. If `len(a) > 1`, `b` is a string containing the characters of the new input string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters of the new input string `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is already sorted in ascending order (`b == s`), then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`, and `b` is now a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input string `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character. If `len(a) > 1`, `b` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is already sorted in ascending order (`b == s`), then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`, and `b` is now a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
