Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input string `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character. If `len(a) > 1`, `b` is a string containing the characters of the new input string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters of the new input string `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is already sorted in ascending order (`b == s`), then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`, and `b` is now a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order.***
