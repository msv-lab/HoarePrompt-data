Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b
    if t % 2 == 0:
        t = t // 2
    else:
        t = t // 2 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. `n` is greater than 0. `i` is 0. `a` is an integer (the first part of the input converted to an integer). If `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is greater than or equal to `a`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t` is updated as follows: if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15`; otherwise, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`. `t2` remains `a - t1`, and if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t2` is a multiple of 15; otherwise, `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer representing the second part of the input, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `t % 2 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `b // 2`. If `t % 2 != 0`, then `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`. `t1` is now `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is greater than or equal to `a`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t` is further updated: if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15`, and if `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. In both cases, `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`, and `t2` remains `a - t1`. Additionally, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t2` is a multiple of 15; otherwise, `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` and `b` are integers, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` remains equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. Otherwise, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `b // 2 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15` if `b` is even, or `b // 2 + 1 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15` if `b` is odd, and `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is updated to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t` is updated to `b // 2 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `b` is even, or `b // 2 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `b` is odd, and `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4` using the original value of `t`, and `t2` is updated to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)` using the original value of `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
