Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer representing the second part of the input, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`, `t2` remains `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t2` is a multiple of 15; otherwise, `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- The value of `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`.
- The value of `t2` remains `a - t1`.
- The conditions regarding `t2 % 15` remain unchanged.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`) retain their initial values and conditions.
