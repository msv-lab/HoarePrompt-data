Output State: **`t` is `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer (the first part of the input converted to an integer), `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
