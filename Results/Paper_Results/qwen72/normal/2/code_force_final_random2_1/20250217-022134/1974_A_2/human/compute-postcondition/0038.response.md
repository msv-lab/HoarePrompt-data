To determine what will be printed when the `print(t)` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial Variables:**
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer representing the second part of the input.
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Update `t` based on `b`:**
   - If `t % 2 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `b // 2`.
   - If `t % 2 != 0`, then `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`.

3. **Calculate `t1`:**
   - `t1` is now `t * 15 - b * 4`.

4. **Check if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - If `t1 < a`, then `t` is further updated:
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - In both cases, `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`, and `t2` remains `a - t1`.
   - Additionally, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t2` is a multiple of 15; otherwise, `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(t)` statement will print the final value of `t` after all the updates.

Given the complexity of the conditions and the lack of specific values for `a` and `b`, we can summarize the output as follows:

- If `t1` is initially greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains the value it was updated to based on `b`.
- If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is further updated based on the value of `t2` and the conditions provided.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the final value of `t` in terms of the conditions and updates:

Output: **t (where t is the final value after being updated based on the conditions described)**
