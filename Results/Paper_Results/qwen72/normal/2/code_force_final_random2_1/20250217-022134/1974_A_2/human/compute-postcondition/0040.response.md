Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer representing the second part of the input, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are updated to the first and second parts of the input respectively.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers, and `x` and `y` are integers within the range [0, 99].
- The code `a, b = input().split()` updates the values of `a` and `b` to the first and second parts of the input, respectively.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions and calculations involving `t`, `t1`, and `t2` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
