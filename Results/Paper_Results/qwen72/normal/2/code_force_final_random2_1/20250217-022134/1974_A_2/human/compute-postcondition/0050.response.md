Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is equal to `b // 2 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15` if `b` is even or `b // 2 + 1 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15` if `b` is odd, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**

Explanation:
- `t` was initially set to `b // 2` if `b` is even or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
- The new value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged or are recalculated based on the updated value of `t`.
