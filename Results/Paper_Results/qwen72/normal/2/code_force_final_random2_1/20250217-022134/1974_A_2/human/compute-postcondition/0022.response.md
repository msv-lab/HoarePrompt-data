To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is defined as `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd.
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an integer (the first part of the input converted to an integer).

2. **Conditions:**
   - `t1` is defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t` is updated as follows:
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`.
   - `t2` remains `a - t1`, and if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t2` is a multiple of 15; otherwise, `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - First, `t` is calculated based on the value of `b`:
     - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2`.
     - If `b` is odd, `t = (b // 2) + 1`.
   - Next, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - We check if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`:
     - If `t1 >= a`, `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is greater than or equal to `a`.
     - If `t1 < a`, we need to update `t`:
       - Calculate `t2` as `a - t1`.
       - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15`.
       - Otherwise, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

4. **Final Value of `t`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains the same.
   - If `t1 < a`, `t` is updated based on the value of `t2`.

Given the complexity of the conditions, the final value of `t` depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and the calculations derived from them. However, the key point is that `t` is updated to ensure that `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`) is at least `a`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(t)` statement will be the final value of `t` after all the conditions have been applied.

Output: **t (where t is the final value of t after applying the conditions described in the initial state)**
