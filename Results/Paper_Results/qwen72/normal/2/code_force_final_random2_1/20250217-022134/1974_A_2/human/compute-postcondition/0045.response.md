Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be the integer division of `b` by 2, plus 1. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
