### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. It uses the formula `t = b // 2` if `b` is even, and `t = b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd. This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. The formula ensures that all 2x2 icons are accommodated, even if `b` is odd.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons using `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This is correct because it multiplies the number of screens by 15 (total cells per screen) and subtracts the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.

4. **Check if Remaining Cells Fit 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to fit all the 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), the program does not change the number of screens (`t`).
   - If the remaining cells are insufficient, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. It does this by dividing the number of remaining 1x1 icons by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder (`t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0`).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the initial number of screens for 2x2 icons is correct.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells and checking if they can fit the 1x1 icons is also correct.
- The logic for calculating additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is correct.

### Simplification Suggestion:
- The initial screen calculation can be simplified to `t = (b + 1) // 2` for clarity, but this does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should work for the given problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
