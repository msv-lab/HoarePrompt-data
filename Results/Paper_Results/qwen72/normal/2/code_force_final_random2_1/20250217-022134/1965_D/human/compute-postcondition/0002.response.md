Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last element removed, and the last element of `bigList` may no longer be equal to the last element of `smallList`.** 

Explanation: The `pop()` method removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `smallList` was initially a non-empty sublist of `bigList`, after removing its last element, it remains a sublist of `bigList`, but now with one less element. The relationship between the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` may still not be equal, depending on their initial values.
