Output State: **`a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`, `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `prev` is the previous value of `x`, `odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must contain at least two elements, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of zeros of length `n` except for the updated values at indices `idx` and `n - 1 - idx`.**

Explanation:
- The value at index `idx` in the list `a` is already set to `(x - prev) // 2`.
- The code updates the value at index `n - 1 - idx` in the list `a` to `(x - prev) // 2`.
- All other variables (`idx`, `x`, `prev`, `odds`, `n`) remain unchanged.
- The list `a` now has non-zero values at indices `idx` and `n - 1 - idx`, while the rest of the elements remain zero.
