To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. `len(smallList) > 0`: This condition checks if `smallList` is not empty.
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`: This condition checks if the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed.
- `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last element removed.
- The last element of `bigList` may no longer be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
- `smallList` must still be non-empty.
- The last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` must be equal.

Since `smallList` is already non-empty (as per the given state), we need to ensure that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. However, the given state indicates that the last element of `bigList` may no longer be equal to the last element of `smallList`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the last elements are equal.

State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last element removed, and the last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`**.
