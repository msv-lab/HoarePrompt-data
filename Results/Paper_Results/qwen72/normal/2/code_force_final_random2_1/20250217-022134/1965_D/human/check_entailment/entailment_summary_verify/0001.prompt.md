You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts

#Function 2:
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds

#Function 3:
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a

#Function 4:
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` takes two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `smallList` is a sublist of `bigList`. It modifies both lists by removing their last elements as long as they are equal and `smallList` is not empty. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after this process. If `smallList` becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal, the function stops removing elements and returns the last element of `bigList`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to recover a palindromic array `a` of length `n` from the sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.
   - We are given \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) subarray sums, and we need to find the missing subarray sum to reconstruct the array `a`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function generates all subarray sums of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates their sums, and appends them to the list `cts`.
   - The list `cts` is then sorted.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose of generating and sorting all subarray sums.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - It uses a stack-like approach to cancel out pairs of identical sums, leaving only those that appear an odd number of times.
   - For a palindromic array, the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times will help us identify the elements of the array.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose of identifying the unique subarray sums.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function constructs the palindromic array `a` from the unique subarray sums identified in `func_2`.
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the unique subarray sums, placing the values in the middle of the array if the index is the same for both ends, otherwise splitting the value equally between the corresponding positions.
   - This function correctly constructs the palindromic array `a`.

5. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the given list of subarray sums (`smallList`).
   - It removes matching elements from the end of both lists until it finds the first mismatch, which is the missing subarray sum.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose of finding the missing subarray sum.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the logic required to solve the problem. Each function performs its intended task accurately, and the overall approach is sound.
