The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from the `bigList`. Since the last element of `bigList` was equal to the last element of `smallList`, removing it means that the last elements of both lists are no longer guaranteed to be equal. However, the rest of the conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last element removed, and the last element of `bigList` is no longer necessarily equal to the last element of `smallList`.**
