### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to recover a palindromic array `a` of length `n` from the given sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function generates all subarray sums of a given palindromic array `a` and returns them in a sorted list. It correctly computes the cumulative sums and sorts them.
   - **func_2**: This function removes consecutive duplicate elements from the list of subarray sums. It ensures that only unique elements are kept, which is necessary for identifying the missing sum.
   - **func_3**: This function reconstructs the palindromic array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums. It correctly fills the array based on the elements of `odds` and ensures the array is palindromic.
   - **func_4**: This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of subarray sums with the list of known subarray sums. It correctly identifies the missing sum by removing matching elements from the end of both lists.

3. **Program Flow**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the input, sorts the subarray sums, and processes them to find the missing sum.
   - It then reconstructs the palindromic array using the identified missing sum and prints the result.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints specified in the problem statement, including the range of `n` and the number of test cases.
   - The program ensures that the reconstructed array is palindromic and meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to recover a palindromic array from the given subarray sums. Each function performs its intended task accurately, and the overall flow of the program is sound.

**Correctness: **True****
