The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `bigList` and `smallList`. Both `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, and `smallList` is a sublist of `bigList`. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after removing the last elements from both `bigList` and `smallList` until they are no longer equal or `smallList` becomes empty.
