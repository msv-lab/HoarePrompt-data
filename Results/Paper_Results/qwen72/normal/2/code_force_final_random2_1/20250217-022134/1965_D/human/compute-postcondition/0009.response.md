Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last elements removed until either `smallList` becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal. `smallList` is a list of integers with the last elements removed until it becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal.** 

In natural language, this means that the loop continues to remove the last elements from both `bigList` and `smallList` as long as they are equal and `smallList` is not empty. The loop stops when either `smallList` is completely empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer the same. At this point, `bigList` will have had some of its last elements removed, and `smallList` will either be empty or will have some of its last elements removed, but the last elements of the two lists will no longer match.
