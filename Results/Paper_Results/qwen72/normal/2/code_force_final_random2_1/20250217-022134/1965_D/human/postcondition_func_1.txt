The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers representing the sums of subarrays of a palindrome array. It processes this list to remove consecutive duplicate elements, returning a new list `odds` that contains only the unique elements from `cts` that do not form pairs of consecutive identical elements. After the function concludes, the original list `cts` remains unchanged, and the returned list `odds` reflects the filtered elements as described.
