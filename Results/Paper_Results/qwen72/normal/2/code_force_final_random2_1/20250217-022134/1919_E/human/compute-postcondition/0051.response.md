Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 2, `i` is `n + 1`, and `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros. If `dp[2] > 0`, then `new_dp[1]` is set to `(new_dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD` and `new_dp[3]` is set to `dp[2] % MOD`. Otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged.***
