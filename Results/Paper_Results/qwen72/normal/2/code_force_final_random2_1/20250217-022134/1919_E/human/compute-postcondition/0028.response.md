Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0 (since it dictates the number of iterations and has been fully consumed), `n` is the last processed integer value from `data`, `p` is the last processed list of `n` integers, `data` remains the same as it was initially, `index` is the final position after processing all elements, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.**
