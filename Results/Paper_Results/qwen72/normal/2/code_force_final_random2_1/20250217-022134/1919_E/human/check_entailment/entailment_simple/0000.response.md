Reasoning:  

The program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of initial arrays `a` that can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the possible prefix sums at each step.

### Function `func_1`:
- **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with a length of `2 * n + 1` to handle all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`. The `offset` is set to `n` to shift the indices so that they start from 0.
- **Dynamic Programming Loop**: The loop iterates `n` times, updating the `dp` array to reflect the possible prefix sums after each step. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, the `new_dp` array is updated based on the current `dp` array. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, it means that the prefix sum `j - offset` is possible, and the next possible prefix sums are `j - offset + 1` and `j - offset - 1`.
- **Final Calculation**: After the loop, the final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, and the corresponding value in the `dp` array is returned.

### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It splits the input into a list of integers and iterates over the test cases.
- **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it extracts the size `n` and the sorted prefix sum array `p`, calls `func_1(n, p)`, and appends the result to the `results` list.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `n = 1` and when the prefix sums are all the same.
- **Correctness of DP**: The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible prefix sums are considered, and the modulo operation ensures that the results are within the required range.
- **Input/Output**: The input and output handling is correct, and the program processes multiple test cases as specified.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
