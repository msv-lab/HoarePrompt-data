The code snippet updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding the value of `dp[j]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `j` is 2.
- `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]` and `new_dp[2]`.
- `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`.

The code snippet:
```python
new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3.
2. `new_dp[j + 1]` is `new_dp[3]`.
3. `dp[j]` is `dp[2]`.
4. The value of `new_dp[3]` is updated to `(new_dp[3] + dp[2]) % MOD`.

Since `new_dp[3]` was initially 0 (as per the initial state), the new value of `new_dp[3]` will be `dp[2] % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]`, `new_dp[2]`, and `new_dp[3]` which is now `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`.**
