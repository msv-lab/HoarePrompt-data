Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]` which is `dp[0] % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. If `j + 1` exceeds `2 * n`, no changes are made to `new_dp`.***
