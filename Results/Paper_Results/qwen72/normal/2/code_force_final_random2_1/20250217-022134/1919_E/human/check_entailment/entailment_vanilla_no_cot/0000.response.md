Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of ways to form the prefix sums array `p` from an array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1.
   - The DP table `dp` is used to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum at each step.
   - The `offset` is used to handle negative indices by shifting the range of possible prefix sums to be non-negative.
   - The loop iterates through each element of the array `a`, updating the DP table based on whether the current element is 1 or -1.
   - Finally, the function returns the value in the DP table corresponding to the final prefix sum, adjusted by the offset.

2. **Reading Input and Handling Multiple Test Cases in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings and iterates through the test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n` and the prefix sums array `p`.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the result for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

The program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly, ensuring that the prefix sums are within the valid range and that the results are computed modulo 998,244,353. Therefore, the program is correct.
