The code snippet `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the list `p` by mapping the elements from `data` starting from index 2 (inclusive) to index 2 + n (exclusive) to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000
- `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace
- `index` is 2
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is now equal to the integer value of `data[1]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `p` is updated to a list of integers, each converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index 2 to index 2 + n - 1.
- The length of `p` is now `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index 2 to index 2 + n - 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**
