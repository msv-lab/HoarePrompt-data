Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]` and `new_dp[2]`. If `dp[j] > 0`, then `new_dp[3]` is set to `dp[2] % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, and `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + new_dp[2]) % MOD` if `j - 1 >= 0`. `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`. If `dp[j]` is not greater than 0, `new_dp` remains unchanged.***
