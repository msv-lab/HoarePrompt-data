Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` with elements updated according to the loop rules, `i` is `n + 1`, `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset`, and `new_dp` is no longer relevant.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer within the specified range.
- The list `dp` retains its length and the values updated during the loop.
- The variable `i` is still `n + 1`.
- The variable `final_sum` is calculated as the sum of the last element of the list `p` and the variable `offset`.
- The variable `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it is overwritten in each iteration and does not affect the final state.
