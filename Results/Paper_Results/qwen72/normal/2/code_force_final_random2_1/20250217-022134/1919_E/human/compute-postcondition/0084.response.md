Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers where each element `p_i` satisfies |p_i| ≤ n, representing the sorted prefix sums of a hidden array `a`. It initializes a list `dp` of length `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for the element at index `n` (the `offset`), which is set to 1. The function then iterates `n` times, updating the `dp` list based on the values of the current `dp` list and the modulo operation with a constant `MOD`. After the loop completes, the function calculates `final_sum` as the sum of the last element of `p` and the `offset`. The function returns the value at the index `final_sum` in the `dp` list. The final state of the program includes the updated `dp` list and the returned value, which represents the result of the dynamic programming process applied to the input parameters. **
