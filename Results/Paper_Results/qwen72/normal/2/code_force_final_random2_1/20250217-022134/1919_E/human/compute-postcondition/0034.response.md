Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list containing at least three elements.
- `res` is the third element in the list `results`.

The `print(res)` statement will print the third element of the list `results`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `results` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the third element of the list `results`.

Output: **res (where res is the third element in the list results)**
