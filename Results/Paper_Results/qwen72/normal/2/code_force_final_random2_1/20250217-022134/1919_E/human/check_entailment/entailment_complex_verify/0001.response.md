### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of possible arrays `a` consisting of only 1s and -1s that can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The result should be modulo \( 998,244,353 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` with an offset to handle negative indices.
   - The DP array `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum `j - n` using the first `i` elements of `a`.

3. **DP Transition:**
   - For each element in the array `a`, we update the DP array based on the previous state.
   - If the current prefix sum is `j`, we can either add 1 or -1 to it.
   - This is reflected in the transitions: `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is `p[-1]`.
   - We adjust this sum using the offset and return the value from the DP array.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored and printed at the end.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as small and large values of `n`.
   - It ensures that the prefix sums are within the valid range and the DP array is updated correctly.

7. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations confirm that the state of the program is correctly maintained throughout the execution.
   - The DP array is initialized and updated correctly, and the final result is computed based on the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem using dynamic programming and handles the input and output as specified. The annotations and the step-by-step reasoning support the correctness of the program.

### Final Answer:
