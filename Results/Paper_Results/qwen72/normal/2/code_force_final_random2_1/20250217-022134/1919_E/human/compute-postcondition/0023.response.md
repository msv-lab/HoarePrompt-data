Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the current iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index `index - 1 - n` to index `index - 2`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 4 + 2*n, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the second element is also the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**.
