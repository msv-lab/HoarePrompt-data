To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- `results` is a list containing at least one element.
- `t` is 0.
- `n` is the last processed integer value from `data`.
- `p` is the last processed list of `n` integers.
- `data` remains the same as it was initially.
- `index` is the final position after processing all elements.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.

### Analysis:
- The variable `res` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is being printed. This suggests that `res` is likely a part of the `results` list or is derived from it.
- Since `results` is a list containing at least one element, and the final value of `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, it is reasonable to assume that `res` is the last element of the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
- The `print(res)` statement will print the last element of the `results` list, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.

### Final Output:
Output: **the last element of the results list (which is the value returned by func_1(n, p) from the last iteration)**
