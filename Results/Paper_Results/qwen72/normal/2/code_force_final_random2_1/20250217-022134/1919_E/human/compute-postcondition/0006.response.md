To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.
- `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace.
- `index` is 1.
- `results` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
- The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a dummy variable used to iterate over the range of `t`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `results`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
