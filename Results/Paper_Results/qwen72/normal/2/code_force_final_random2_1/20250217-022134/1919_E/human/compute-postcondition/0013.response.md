The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index 2 to index 2 + n - 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 2 + n, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**
