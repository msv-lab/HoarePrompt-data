Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem using dynamic programming. It initializes a `dp` array to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `dp[n] = 1`, where `n` is the offset to handle negative indices.
   - The function iterates through the prefix sums and updates the `dp` array based on the transitions allowed by adding or subtracting 1.
   - The final result is obtained by looking up the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the final prefix sum plus the offset.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases. It reads the input from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and collects the results.
   - The input is read in bulk and split into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers as needed.
   - For each test case, it extracts the size `n` and the prefix sums `p`, calls `func_1` with these parameters, and appends the result to a list of results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Validation**:
   - The problem constraints and the logic implemented in both functions align with the requirements.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` correctly accounts for the transitions between prefix sums.
   - The handling of multiple test cases in `func_2` is done efficiently and correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
