Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, then calling another function `func_1` with `n` and `p`. The results of these calls are collected and printed one by one. After the function completes, the input data remains unchanged, and the results of the test cases are printed to the standard output. **
