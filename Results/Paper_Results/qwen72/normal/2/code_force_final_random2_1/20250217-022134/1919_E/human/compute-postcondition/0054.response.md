Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is `2 * n`, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element has been updated based on the rules defined in the loop, and `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `j` remains `2 * n`.
- The condition `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0 remains true.
- The value of `i` remains `n + 1`.
- The list `new_dp` retains its length and the updates made to its elements based on the rules defined in the loop.
- The list `dp` is now set to be equal to `new_dp`.
