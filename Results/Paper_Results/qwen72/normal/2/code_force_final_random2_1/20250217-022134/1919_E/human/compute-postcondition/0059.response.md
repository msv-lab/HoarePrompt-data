Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 0, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0, `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`, the value of `dp[j]` (which is `dp[0]`) is greater than 0, and `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.**
