Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 0.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which is `data[0]`. All other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, and `index`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
