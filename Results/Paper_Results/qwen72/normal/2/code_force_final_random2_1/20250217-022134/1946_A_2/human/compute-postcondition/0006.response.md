Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This expression finds the middle index of the list `a` when `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle when `n` is even. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
