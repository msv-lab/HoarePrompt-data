Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `op = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `op`. Since `op` was already initialized to 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
