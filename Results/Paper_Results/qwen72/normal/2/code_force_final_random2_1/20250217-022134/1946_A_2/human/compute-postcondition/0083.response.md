To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will execute if `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. The relevant variables in the loop head are `new_median` and `median`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `num` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`
- `new_median` is the same as `median`

For the loop to execute, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`. Since `new_median` is initially the same as `median`, the condition `new_median <= median` is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, `new_median` is the same as `median`**
