To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.
   - `median` is also the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.
   - `b[ma]` is `median + 1`.

Given these conditions:
- `new_median` and `median` are both the same element in the sorted list `b` at index `ma`.
- However, `b[ma]` is specified to be `median + 1`, which means `b[ma]` is actually greater than `median`.

### Adjusting the State:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must still be less than or equal to `median`.
- Since `new_median` and `median` are the same element in the sorted list `b` at index `ma`, and `b[ma]` is `median + 1`, the current state already satisfies the condition `new_median <= median`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, `b[ma]` is `median + 1`**.
