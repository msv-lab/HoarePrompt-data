The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The initial state provided already ensures that `t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which means the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array a, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
