Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program calculates the count of the current median value in the array and prints this count as the result. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```

In this case, the current median is 2, and the program outputs `2` because the median value 2 appears twice in the array. However, the correct answer is `1`, as increasing the first element from 2 to 3 results in the array `[3, 2, 8]`, which has a new median of 3, thus increasing the median with only one operation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
