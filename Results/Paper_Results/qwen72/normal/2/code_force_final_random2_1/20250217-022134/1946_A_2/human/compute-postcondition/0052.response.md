The code snippet `b[ma] += 1` increments the value at the index `ma` in the list `b` by 1. Here's the detailed impact:

- `b[ma]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `num` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is an input string.
- `op` is 0.
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`.
- `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd.
- `new_median` is equal to `median`.

After executing `b[ma] += 1`:
- The value at index `ma` in the list `b` is incremented by 1.
- `median` remains the same because it was calculated before the increment.
- `new_median` remains the same because it was also calculated before the increment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, `new_median` is equal to `median`.**
