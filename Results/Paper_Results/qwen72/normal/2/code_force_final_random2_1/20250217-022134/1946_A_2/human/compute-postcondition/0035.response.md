To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case` where each element is a digit-only substring converted to an integer.
   - The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
   - `num` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `num2` is an input integer and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000.
   - `case` is an input string.
   - `op` is the number of times the loop has executed.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`.
   - `ma` is set to `(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd.
   - `b[ma]` is incremented by the number of times the loop has executed.
   - `median` is the final value of `b[ma]` plus 1.
   - `new_median` is the final value of `b[ma]`.

2. **Key Points:**
   - The variable `op` represents the number of times the loop has executed.
   - The loop increments `b[ma]` by the number of times it has executed.
   - The final value of `b[ma]` is used to compute `median` and `new_median`.

3. **What is printed:**
   - The `print(op)` statement will print the value of `op`, which is the number of times the loop has executed.

Given the initial state and the operations described, the value of `op` is directly the number of times the loop has executed. Since the exact number of loop executions is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **op (where op is the number of times the loop has executed)**
