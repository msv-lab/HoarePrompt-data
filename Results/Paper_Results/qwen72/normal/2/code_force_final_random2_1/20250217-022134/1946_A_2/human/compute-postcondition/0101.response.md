Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` is the total number of iterations the loop was set to run, `i` is `num` (indicating the loop has completed all its iterations), `num2` is the last input integer, `case` is the last input string, `op` is the total number of operations performed across all iterations, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the last `case`, `median` is the median of the last `b` before any increments, `new_median` is the final value of the median after all increments. If any `num2` > 10000, the loop would have broken early, but since it completed, no `num2` exceeded 10000.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `num`, indicating that the loop has run the specified number of times.
- The variable `op` will contain the total number of operations performed across all iterations.
- The variable `b` will be the sorted list of integers from the last input string `case`.
- The variable `median` will be the median of the last `b` before any increments.
- The variable `new_median` will be the final value of the median after all increments.
- The loop did not encounter any `num2` greater than 10000, as it would have broken out of the loop if it did.
