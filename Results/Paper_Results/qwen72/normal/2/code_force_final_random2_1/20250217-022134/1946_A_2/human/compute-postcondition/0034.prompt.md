Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case` where each element is a digit-only substring converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `median`.
Code of the loop:
while new_median <= median:
    b[ma] += 1
    op += 1
    b = sorted(b)
    new_median = b[ma]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case` where each element is a digit-only substring converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` plus 1, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case` where each element is a digit-only substring converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `median` is the new value of `b[ma]` plus 1, `new_median` is the new value of `b[ma]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case` where each element is a digit-only substring converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 3, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `median` is the new value of `b[ma]` plus 1, `new_median` is the new value of `b[ma]` which is `b[ma]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
