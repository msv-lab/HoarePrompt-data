To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`.
   - The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
   - `num` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `num2` is an input integer.
   - `case` is an input string.
   - `op` is the number of iterations required for `new_median` to exceed `median`.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`.
   - `b[ma]` is incremented by the number of iterations required for `new_median` to exceed `median`.
   - `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before any increments.
   - `new_median` is equal to `median + 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`.
   - `ma` is an index in the list `b` that represents the median position.
   - `median` is the value at the median position in the sorted list `b`.
   - `new_median` is the value of `median + 1`.
   - `op` is the number of iterations required for `new_median` to exceed `median`.

3. **Calculating `op`:**
   - Since `new_median` is `median + 1`, it will always be one more than `median`.
   - To make `new_median` exceed `median`, it already does so by definition because `new_median = median + 1`.
   - Therefore, no iterations are needed for `new_median` to exceed `median`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `op` is 0 because `new_median` is already greater than `median` by 1.

Output: **0**
