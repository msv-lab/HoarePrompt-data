The code snippet `a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]` processes the string `case` by splitting it into parts based on whitespace, filtering out only the parts that consist entirely of digits, converting those parts to integers, and storing them in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `num` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` is updated to contain the integers extracted from the string `case`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0.**
