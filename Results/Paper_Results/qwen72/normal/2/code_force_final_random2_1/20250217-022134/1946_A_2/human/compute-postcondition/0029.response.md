To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue executing as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. Therefore, the key variables in the loop head are `new_median` and `median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `new_median` is the new value of `b[ma]`.
- `median` is the new value of `b[ma]` plus 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must still be less than or equal to `median`. Since `median` is defined as `new_median + 1`, the condition `new_median <= median` will always be true unless `new_median` is incremented to be greater than `median`.

However, the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted. The only way to change the loop condition is to modify `new_median` or `median`. Since `median` is derived from `new_median`, changing `median` would not make sense without changing `new_median`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `new_median` should remain less than or equal to `median`. Given the current state, no adjustment is necessary because the condition `new_median <= median` is already satisfied.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case` where each element is a digit-only substring converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `median` is the new value of `b[ma]` plus 1, `new_median` is the new value of `b[ma]`**.
