Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers.
- `p` is calculated as \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\).
- `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `p`**:
   - `p` is calculated as \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\).
   - This formula is used to find the middle index of the list `a` when `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle when `n` is even.
   - For example:
     - If `n = 5`, then \(p = (5 + 1) // 2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\).
     - If `n = 6`, then \(p = (6 + 1) // 2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\).

2. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list, the element at index `p` is the median element (or one of the two middle elements if `n` is even).

3. **What is printed**:
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.
- Since `a` is sorted, the element at index `p` is the median element (or one of the two middle elements if `n` is even), and `res` is the count of this element in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of the element at index p in the list a, and p is calculated as (n + 1) // 2 - 1)**
