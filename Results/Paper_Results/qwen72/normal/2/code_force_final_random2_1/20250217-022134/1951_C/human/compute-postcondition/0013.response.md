Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now `k * k / 2 + 2 * l[i] * s - s * s`, `k` is now `k - min(m, k)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value.
- The current value of `c` before the update is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.
- After the update, `c` becomes `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, which simplifies to `k * k / 2 + 2 * l[i] * s - s * s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`) remain unchanged except for `k`, which is already updated to `k - min(m, k)`.
