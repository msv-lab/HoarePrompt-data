The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is set to 0 before the loop starts, which is appropriate for the loop to begin.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0 (which is already given and correct).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is equal to `k * k / 2`**
