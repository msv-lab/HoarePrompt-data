Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is the initial value of `n`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`, and the list `l` is now a sorted list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is set to 0, overriding its previous value which was `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `l`) remain unchanged. The value of `c` is recalculated using the new value of `s` (which is 0), but the expression for `c` remains the same.
