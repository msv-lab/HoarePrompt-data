The code snippet `c = k * k / 2` calculates the value of `c` by squaring `k` and then dividing the result by 2. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is equal to `k * k / 2`.**
