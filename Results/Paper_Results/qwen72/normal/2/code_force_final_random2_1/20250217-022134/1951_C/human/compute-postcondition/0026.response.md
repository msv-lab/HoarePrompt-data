To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is `a`
- `n` is `a`
- `m` is `b`
- `k` is `c - a * min(b, c)`
- `s` is 0
- `c` is `k * k / 2`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

### Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The initial value of `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point for the loop.

### Final State:
- `t` remains as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged)
- `i` is 0 (initial value for the loop)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (to ensure the loop executes)
- `m` remains as `b` (unchanged)
- `k` remains as `c - a * min(b, c)` (unchanged)
- `s` remains as 0 (unchanged)
- `c` remains as `k * k / 2` (unchanged)
- `l` remains as a sorted list of integers from the input (unchanged)

### State:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is `b`, `k` is `c - a * min(b, c)`, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input**
