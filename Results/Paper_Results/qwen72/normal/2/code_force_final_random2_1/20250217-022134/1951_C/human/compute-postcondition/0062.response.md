Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the same as the initial value of `n` for each test case, `m` is the same as the initial value of `m` for each test case, `k` is 0, `s` is the last computed value of `min(m, k)` before `k` becomes 0, `c` is the final computed cost which is the sum of the costs calculated for each test case, and the list `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input for each test case.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged, indicating the total number of test cases.
- The loop index `i` will be `t-1` after the loop completes, meaning it has iterated through all test cases.
- The variables `n` and `m` retain their initial values for each test case, as they are re-initialized at the start of each iteration.
- The variable `k` is reduced to 0, as the loop continues until all required tickets are bought.
- The variable `s` holds the last computed value of `min(m, k)` before `k` reaches 0.
- The variable `c` accumulates the total cost of buying the tickets, which is calculated based on the sorted prices and the number of tickets bought each day.
- The list `l` remains a sorted list of ticket prices for each test case, as it is sorted at the beginning of each iteration.
