To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is the same as the initial value of `n`.
   - `m` is `b`.
   - `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - n * min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`.
   - `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`.
   - `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.

2. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - **Calculate `s`:**
     \[
     s = \min(b, c - a \cdot \min(b, c))
     \]
     This formula determines the minimum value between `b` and the result of `c - a * min(b, c)`.

   - **Calculate `k`:**
     \[
     k = c - a \cdot \min(b, c) - n \cdot \min(b, c - a \cdot \min(b, c))
     \]
     This formula involves multiple nested minimum operations and multiplications.

   - **Calculate `c`:**
     \[
     c = k \cdot k / 2 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] \cdot s - s \cdot s / 2)
     \]
     This formula calculates `c` as the sum of two parts:
     - The first part is \( k \cdot k / 2 \).
     - The second part is the sum of \( l[j] \cdot s - s \cdot s / 2 \) for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(int(c))` statement will convert the value of `c` to an integer and print it.

Given the complexity of the formulas and the dependencies on the initial values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the list `l`, the exact numerical value of `c` cannot be determined without specific values for these variables. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the integer value of `c` after all the calculations.

Output: **int(c) (where c is calculated as described above)**
