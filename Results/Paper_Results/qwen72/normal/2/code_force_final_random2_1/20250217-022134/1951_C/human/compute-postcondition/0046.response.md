Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is the initial value of `n`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`, and the list `l` is now a sorted list of integers from the input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated to `k * k / 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
