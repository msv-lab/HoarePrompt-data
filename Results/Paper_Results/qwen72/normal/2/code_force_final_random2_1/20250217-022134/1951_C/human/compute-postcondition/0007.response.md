Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is equal to `k * k / 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated to the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `c`) retain their initial values or conditions.
