Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(m, k) for j in range(n)) - sum(min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2 for _ in range(n))`, `k` is now `k - n * min(m, k)`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.
- **`m` and `k`**: These remain positive integers, but `k` is reduced by `min(m, k)` in each iteration.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is a sorted list of integers from the input.
- **`s`**: In each iteration, `s` is set to `min(m, k)`, which is the same value for each iteration.
- **`c`**: The final value of `c` is calculated by summing up the contributions from each iteration. Specifically, `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` in each iteration. Therefore, the total contribution to `c` is the sum of these terms over all iterations.
- **`k`**: After `n` iterations, `k` is reduced by `n * min(m, k)` because `s` (which is `min(m, k)`) is subtracted from `k` in each iteration.
