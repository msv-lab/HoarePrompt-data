Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` is either `[b[0]]` if `b[0] != b[1]` or remains an empty list otherwise, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `2 * (k - len(l)) - 2`, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` and is now sorted, `c` is now the slice of `a` starting from index `n` to the end and is sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * (k - len(l))`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decremented by 2, so the new value of `k` is `2 * (k - len(l)) - 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
