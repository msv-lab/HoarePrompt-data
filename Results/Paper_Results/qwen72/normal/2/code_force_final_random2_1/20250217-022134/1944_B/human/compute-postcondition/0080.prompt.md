Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is set to `req`, `i` will be `n-1` (or the loop may break early if `k` reaches 0), `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `k` will be reduced by 2 for each pair found, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`k` is set to `req`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is set to `req - 2` and `ans2` now includes the value of `c[1]` and `c[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `i`, `n`, `ans1`, `l`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`k` is set to `req`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `k` is set to `req - 2`, and `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[2]`. If `k` is 0 at any point, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `i`, `n`, `ans1`, `l`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`k` is initially set to `req`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, and `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is updated to `req - 2`, and if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]`, `c[3]`, and `c[3]`. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `i`, `n`, `ans1`, `l`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
