Output State: **`k` is set to `req`, `i` will be `n-1` (or the loop may break early if `k` reaches 0), `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `k` will be reduced by 2 for each pair found, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element.**
