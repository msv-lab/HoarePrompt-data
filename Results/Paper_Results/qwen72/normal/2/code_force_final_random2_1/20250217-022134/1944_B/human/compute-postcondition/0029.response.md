The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` adds the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial conditions, `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, and `ans1` already includes the value of `b[i]`.

Therefore, the value of `b[i]` is added again to `ans1`, making `ans1` include the value of `b[i]` twice.

The other conditions (`n` must be at least 3, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the value of `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now includes the value of `b[i]` twice.**
