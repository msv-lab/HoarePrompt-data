To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, which means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1, because if `n` is 1 or less, the range `range(1, n)` would be empty, and the loop would not run.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the first integer from the input

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
