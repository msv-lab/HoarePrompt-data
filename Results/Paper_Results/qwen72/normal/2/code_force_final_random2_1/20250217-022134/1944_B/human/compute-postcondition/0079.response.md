Postcondition: ***`k` is initially set to `req`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, and `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is updated to `req - 2`, and if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]`, `c[3]`, and `c[3]`. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `i`, `n`, `ans1`, `l`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.***
