The code `l.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` from list `b` to list `l`. Given that `i` is 2, the element `b[2]` is appended to `l`.

- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than 3.
- `len(l)` increases by 1, so `len(l)` is now 3.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `ans1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `len(l)` is 3, `k` is unchanged, `ans1` is unchanged.**
