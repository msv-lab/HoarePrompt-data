Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `len(l)` is 2 or 3 depending on the condition. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decreased by 2, and `ans1` remains unchanged but includes the elements `b[3]` and `b[3]`. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, then `len(l)` is 2 or 3 depending on whether `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, and `k` and `ans1` remain unchanged. If `k` is 0 at any point, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
