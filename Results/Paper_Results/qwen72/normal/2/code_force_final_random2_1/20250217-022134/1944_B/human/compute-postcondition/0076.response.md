Output State: **`k` is set to `req`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[3]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) of list `c` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` was 3, the new element appended to `ans2` is `c[3]`. The rest of the variables (`k`, `i`, `n`, `ans1`, and `l`) remain unchanged. If `k` is 0, the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid.
