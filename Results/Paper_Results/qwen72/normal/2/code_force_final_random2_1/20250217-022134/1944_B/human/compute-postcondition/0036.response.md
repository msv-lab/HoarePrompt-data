The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being within the range from 1 to `n-2` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 3, and `i` is some value within the valid range for the loop to have executed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be large enough such that `i` is less than `n-1`. Therefore, if `i` was previously `x`, it is now `x + 1`, and `n` must be at least `x + 2` for the loop to continue executing.

Given that `i` was in a valid state to execute the loop, let's assume `i` was `x` (where `1 <= x < n-1`). After incrementing, `i` becomes `x + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n-1`, so `x + 1 < n-1` which simplifies to `x < n-2`. Since `x` was already valid, `n` must be at least `x + 2`.

Therefore, the new state is:
State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 2** (assuming `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, as the smallest possible value for `i` to start the loop is 1). If `i` was a different value, adjust accordingly, but the principle remains the same: `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be at least `i + 2`.
