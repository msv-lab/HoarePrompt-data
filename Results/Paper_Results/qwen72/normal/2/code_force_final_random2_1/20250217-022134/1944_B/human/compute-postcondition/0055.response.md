Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n-1` (or the loop may break early if `k` reaches 0). The list `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, and `k` will be reduced by 2 for each pair found. The list `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `k` reaches 0 before the loop completes, the loop will terminate early.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
- For each iteration, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, the value `b[i]` is appended to `ans1` twice, and `k` is decreased by 2.
- If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, the value `b[i]` is appended to `l`.
- The loop will terminate early if `k` reaches 0.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n - 1` unless the loop terminates early due to `k` reaching 0.
- The final state of `ans1` will include all pairs of consecutive duplicates found in `b`.
- The final state of `l` will include all elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element.
- The value of `k` will be reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive duplicates found.
