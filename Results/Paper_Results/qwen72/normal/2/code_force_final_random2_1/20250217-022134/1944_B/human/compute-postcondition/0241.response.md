Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `len(l)` is 2. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decreased by 2, and `ans1` is updated by appending the value of `b[2]`. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, then `len(l)` is 3 if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, otherwise `len(l)` remains 2. In both cases, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans1` remains unchanged. If `k` is not 0, the program continues with `k` unchanged and `ans1` unchanged.***
