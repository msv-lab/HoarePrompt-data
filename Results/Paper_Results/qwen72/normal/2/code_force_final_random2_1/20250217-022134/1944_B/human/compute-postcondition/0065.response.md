Postcondition: ***`k` is set to `req`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is set to `req - 2` and `ans2` now includes the value of `c[1]` and `c[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `i`, `n`, `ans1`, `l`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.***
