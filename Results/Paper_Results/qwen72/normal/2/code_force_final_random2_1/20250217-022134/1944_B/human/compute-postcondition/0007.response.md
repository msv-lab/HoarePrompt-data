The code snippet `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in ascending order. The sorting operation affects the order of elements in `c` but does not change the values of the elements themselves. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `q`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the last `n` elements of `a`.**
