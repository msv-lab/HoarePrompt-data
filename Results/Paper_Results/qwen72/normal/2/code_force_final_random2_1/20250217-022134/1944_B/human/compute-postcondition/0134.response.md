Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is either 0, `2 * k`, or `2 * k - 2` depending on the condition, `ans2` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from the input, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` twice, and possibly `b[1]` twice if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, now sorted in ascending order, `req` is either 0, `2 * k`, or `2 * k - 2` depending on the condition. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `l` may contain `b[i]` and possibly `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `l` remains unchanged. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
