Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates under the constraints that there are `t` test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000). For each test case, it considers integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋) and a list `a` of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.**
