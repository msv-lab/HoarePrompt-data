The value of `k` is decremented by 2. Given that `k` is -2 if `b[2]` equals `b[1]` and `k` is not 0 if `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`, the new value of `k` will be -4 if `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, and `k` will be some value less than -2 (specifically, `k - 2`) if `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `ans1` now includes the elements at indices 2, 2, 3, and 3 of `b` if `b[2]` equals `b[1]` and `k` is -4, otherwise `ans1` includes the elements at indices 2, 3, and 3 of `b` and `l` includes the element `b[2]`, `k` is some value less than -2 if `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`.**
