Output State: **`k` is set to `req`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element, `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
