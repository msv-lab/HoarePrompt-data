Output State: **`k` is set to `req`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]`, `c[3]`, and `c[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) of the list `c` to the list `ans2`.
- Since `i` is 3, the element `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`.
- The initial state mentioned that `ans2` already contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[3]`. After appending `c[3]` again, `ans2` now contains `c[2]`, `c[3]`, and `c[3]`.
- All other variables (`k`, `i`, `n`, `ans1`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
