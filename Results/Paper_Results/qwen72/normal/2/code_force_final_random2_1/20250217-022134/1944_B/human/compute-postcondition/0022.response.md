Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the last `n` elements of `a`, `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` contains the values `b[n - 1]` and `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is now 2 * k, `req` is 2 * k, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`). If `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, `k` is updated to 2 * k - 2, and `l` is an empty list unless `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, in which case `l` contains the first element of `b`.**
