Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the last `n` elements of `a`, `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` contains the values `b[n - 1]` and `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is now 2 * k, `req` is 2 * k, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`). If `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, `k` is updated to 2 * k - 2, and `l` is an empty list unless `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, in which case `l` contains the first element of `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be at least 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now includes the value of `b[i]` twice, and `k` is `k - 2`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` now includes the value of `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 2. If `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, `ans1` now includes the elements at indices 2 and 2 of `b`, and `k` is -2. If `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`, `l` now includes the element `b[2]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 3. If `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, `ans1` includes the elements at indices 2, 3, and 3 of `b`, and `k` is -4. If `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`, `l` includes the element `b[2]`, and `k` is -2. Additionally, if `b[3]` does not equal `b[4]`, `l` includes the element `b[3]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
