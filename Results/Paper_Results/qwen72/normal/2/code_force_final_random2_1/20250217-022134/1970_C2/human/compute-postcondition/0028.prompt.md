Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-2`, `t` is updated to the value provided by the input, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default type list where each key (node) has a list of connected nodes (values), `start` is an integer where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, and `leaves` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`nodes` must contain at least one key. If the length of the list associated with the current key in `nodes` is 1, `leaves` includes the `key`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`nodes` must contain at least one key. If the length of the list associated with the next `key` in `nodes` is 1, `leaves` will include the next `key` appended to it. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`nodes` must contain at least one unprocessed key, `key` is the next key in `nodes`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `leaves` now includes `key`. Otherwise, the state of `nodes` and `leaves` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
