Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by the input, `nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of each node, `start` is an integer where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, representing the starting node for the game, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is set to `True`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, and `edges`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
