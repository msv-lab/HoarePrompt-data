Based on the initial state provided:

- `nodes` remains unchanged after the loop.
- `leaves` contains all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connection.
- Other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `u`, `v`) remain in their initial states.
- `start` is an input integer.
- `moves` is the result of calling `func_1(nodes, start)`.
- `moves` is empty or evaluates to False.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Hermione')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Hermione'`.

Output: **Hermione**
