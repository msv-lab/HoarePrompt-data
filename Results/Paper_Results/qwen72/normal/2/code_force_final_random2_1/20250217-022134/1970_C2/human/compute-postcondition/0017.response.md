Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-2`, `t` is updated to the value provided by the input, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default type list where each key (node) has a list of connected nodes (values), `start` is an integer where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, and `leaves` is an empty deque.**
