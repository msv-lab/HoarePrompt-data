Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-2`, `t` is updated to the value provided by the input, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default type list where each key (node) has a list of connected nodes (values), `start` is an integer where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, and `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n-1` times, so `i` will be `n-2` after the last iteration.
- Each iteration reads a pair of integers `u` and `v` and adds them to the `nodes` dictionary, creating a bidirectional connection between the nodes.
- The `nodes` dictionary will contain all the connections specified by the input pairs.
- The variables `start`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
