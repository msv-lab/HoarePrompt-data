### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided solution. Let's break down the issues and validate the original assessment:

1. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the alphabet and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the function will return `abcabc`.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The task requires generating a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the required subsequences are 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc', 'ca', 'cb', 'cc'.

3. **Analysis of the Provided Solution**:
   - The string `abcabc` generated by the function does not contain all the required subsequences.
   - Specifically, the combination 'cc' is not a subsequence of `abcabc`.
   - This means the function fails to meet the requirement for at least one potential case.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the provided solution does not generate a string that ensures all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence.
   - Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
