Let's break down the initial state and the operations performed on the `nums` list to determine the length of `nums` when the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input positive integer.
- `k` is an input positive integer.
- `nums` is a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, followed by `k + 1`, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but without the element `1 << idx`.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists.
- `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists (potentially updated if the removed element was the first element greater than `k`).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial List Construction**:
   - `nums` starts as a list of powers of 2 up to a certain point.
   - An additional element `k - nums[idx]` is appended to `nums`.
   - Another element `k + 1` is appended to `nums`.
   - Another element `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to `nums`.
   - The element `1 << idx` is removed from `nums`.

2. **Determine `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If no such element exists, `idx` is -1.

3. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`.
   - If no such element exists, `i` is the length of `nums`.

### Calculation of `len(nums)`:
- Initially, `nums` contains powers of 2 up to a certain point.
- We add three elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- We remove one element: `1 << idx`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `nums` initially contains `[1, 2, 4, 8]`.
- If `k = 7`, then `idx` is 2 (since `4` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 7).
- The elements added are:
  - `k - nums[idx] = 7 - 4 = 3`
  - `k + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8`
  - `k + nums[idx] + 1 = 7 + 4 + 1 = 12`
- The element removed is `1 << idx = 4`.
- The new `nums` list becomes `[1, 2, 3, 8, 12]`.

### Final Length Calculation:
- The initial length of `nums` is 4.
- We add 3 elements: `3`, `8`, and `12`.
- We remove 1 element: `4`.
- The final length of `nums` is \(4 + 3 - 1 = 6\).

### General Case:
- The initial length of `nums` is the number of powers of 2 up to a certain point.
- We add 3 elements and remove 1 element.
- Therefore, the final length of `nums` is the initial length plus 2.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the length of `nums`, which is the initial length of `nums` plus 2.

Output: **len(nums) (where len(nums) is the initial length of nums plus 2)**
