The code `nums.append(k - nums[idx])` adds a new element to the list `nums`. This new element is the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `nums` is a list of powers of 2.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `k - nums[idx]` calculates the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- This difference is appended to the list `nums`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.**
