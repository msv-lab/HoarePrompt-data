You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\). For each test case, `nums` is a list initially containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). After processing each test case, `nums` is modified by removing the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) (where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists) and appending the elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The final state of `nums` for each test case will reflect these changes. The loop prints the length of the modified `nums` list and its contents for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it modifies a list `nums` that initially contains the first 21 powers of 2 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)). It finds the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, removes this power of 2 from `nums`, and appends three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` (where `idx` is the index of the removed power of 2). The function then prints the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the approach used to construct the sequence `nums` may fail to meet the requirement that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, while ensuring that for all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5 3
```

### Expected Output:
A sequence of size at most 25 such that:
- There is no subsequence with a sum of 3.
- For all \(1 \le v \le 5\) where \(v \ne 3\), there is a subsequence with a sum of \(v\).

### Program's Output:
```
25
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2 4 6
```

### Analysis:
- The sequence generated by the program includes the number 2 and 1, which can form a subsequence with a sum of 3 (i.e., [2, 1]).
- This violates the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of 3.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for this input, making it incorrect.
