The code snippet `nums.append(k + 1)` appends the value `k + 1` to the list `nums`. This operation modifies the list `nums` by adding a new element at the end. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Let's break down the impact:

- `nums` is initially a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended.
- After executing the code, `nums` will have one more element, which is `k + 1`.
- The length of `nums` increases by 1.
- The indices of the elements in `nums` remain the same, but the last index now points to the new element `k + 1`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, followed by `k + 1`, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.**
