To determine what will be printed by the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the `nums` list step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input positive integer.
- `k` is an input positive integer.
- `nums` is a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, followed by `k + 1`, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but without the element `1 << idx`.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists.
- `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists (potentially updated if the removed element was the first element greater than `k`).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial List of Powers of 2**:
   - `nums` starts as a list of powers of 2 up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Appending Elements**:
   - `k - nums[idx]` is appended to `nums`.
   - `k + 1` is appended to `nums`.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to `nums`.

3. **Removing Element**:
   - The element `1 << idx` is removed from `nums`.

4. **Finding Index `i`**:
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`.
   - If the removed element was the first element greater than `k`, `i` might be updated.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `k = 10` for simplicity:
- The initial list of powers of 2 up to 10 is `[1, 2, 4, 8]`.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10, which is 3 (for the value 8).
- `k - nums[idx]` is `10 - 8 = 2`.
- `k + 1` is `10 + 1 = 11`.
- `k + nums[idx] + 1` is `10 + 8 + 1 = 19`.
- The element `1 << idx` is `8`, which is removed from the list.

So, the updated `nums` list becomes:
- Initial: `[1, 2, 4, 8]`
- After appending: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 2, 11, 19]`
- After removing `8`: `[1, 2, 4, 2, 11, 19]`

### Final Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print the elements of the `nums` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 4 2 11 19**

This output reflects the final state of the `nums` list after all the specified operations have been applied.
