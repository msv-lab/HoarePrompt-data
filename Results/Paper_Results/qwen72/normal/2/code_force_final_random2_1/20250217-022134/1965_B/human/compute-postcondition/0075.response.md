Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it modifies a list `nums` that initially contains the first 21 powers of 2 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)). It finds the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, removes this power of 2 from `nums`, and appends three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` (where `idx` is the index of the removed power of 2). The function then prints the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
