The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than the length of `nums`.

Given that `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), the length of `nums` is 21. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2 and the length of `nums` must still be 21.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 2, `idx` remains -1 unless `nums[1]` is greater than `k`, in which case `idx` is set to 0 and the loop breaks.**
