Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `i` is 0. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `idx` remains -1.***
