Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution attempts to construct a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements by using powers of 2 and then modifying it to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Incorrect Construction of Initial Sequence**: The initial sequence `nums` is constructed using powers of 2, which is a good start because these values can form any sum up to \(2^{21} - 1\) (which is much larger than the maximum value of `n`). However, the way the sequence is modified to avoid a subsequence summing to `k` is flawed.

2. **Modification Logic**: The logic for removing and appending elements to `nums` is not correct. Specifically, the code removes an element from `nums` and appends new elements, but this does not guarantee that no subsequence will sum to `k`, nor does it ensure that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are achievable.

3. **Potential Issues with Edge Cases**: The approach may fail for certain edge cases, especially when `k` is close to `n` or when `k` is a power of 2.

A more robust approach would involve constructing a sequence that ensures all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible while avoiding any subsequence that sums to `k`. One effective method is to use a combination of small values and carefully chosen larger values to cover the required sums.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        # Start with the smallest possible values
        nums = list(range(1, min(25, n + 1)))
        
        # Ensure no subsequence sums to k
        if k <= len(nums):
            nums[k - 1] = k + 1
        
        # Ensure all other sums are possible
        if k > len(nums):
            nums.append(k + 1)
        
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

func()
```

This corrected version starts with a sequence of the smallest possible values and modifies it to ensure no subsequence sums to `k` while still covering all other sums from 1 to `n`.
