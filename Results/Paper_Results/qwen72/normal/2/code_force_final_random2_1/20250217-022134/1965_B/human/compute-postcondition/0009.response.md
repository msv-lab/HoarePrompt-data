The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `nums` contains 21 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (to 1) and must still be less than the length of `nums` (which is 21).

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is -1, `i` is 1**
