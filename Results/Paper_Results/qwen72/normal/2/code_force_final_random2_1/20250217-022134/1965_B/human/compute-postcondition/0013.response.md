The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `nums` is a list containing 21 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `nums` must still have at least 21 elements.

Since the condition about `nums[1]` being greater than `k` and setting `idx` to 0 or leaving `idx` as -1 does not affect the loop control variables (`i` and `len(nums)`), these conditions do not change the state needed for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is 0, `i` is 2**.
