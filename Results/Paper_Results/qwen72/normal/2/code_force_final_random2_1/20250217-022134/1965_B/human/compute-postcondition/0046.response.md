The code `nums.remove(1 << idx)` removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `nums` initially contains powers of 2, an additional element `k - nums[idx]`, and `k + 1`, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists.
- `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.

After executing `nums.remove(1 << idx)`:
- The element `1 << idx` is removed from `nums`.
- The value of `idx` remains the same.
- The value of `i` might change if the removed element was the first element in `nums` that was greater than `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, followed by `k + 1`, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but without the element `1 << idx`, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists (potentially updated if the removed element was the first element greater than `k`).**
