Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`, `idx` is -1, `i` is the index of `k + 1` in the updated list `nums`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is set to -1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `i`) retain their initial values or conditions.
