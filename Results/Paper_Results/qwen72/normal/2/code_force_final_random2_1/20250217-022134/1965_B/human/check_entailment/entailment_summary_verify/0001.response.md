### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with the first 21 powers of 2 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
   - It finds the index `idx` of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It appends three additional values to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - It removes the value `1 << idx` from `nums`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
     - The program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully selecting and removing elements.
     - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, it avoids creating a subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - **Subsequences for All Other Values:**
     - The powers of 2 in `nums` ensure that all values from 1 to \(2^{20} - 1\) can be formed.
     - The additional values `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help cover the remaining values up to `n`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases by ensuring the sequence size does not exceed 25.
   - It correctly handles the removal of the appropriate power of 2 to avoid forming a subsequence that sums to `k`.

5. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the steps taken by the program.
   - The summary confirms that the program modifies the list `nums` to ensure no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other values from 1 to `n`.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly constructs the sequence `a` according to the problem requirements.
- It ensures no subsequence sums to `k` and covers all other values from 1 to `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
