Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `i` is 0, `idx` is now -1, and the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is updated to `i - 1`, which means `idx` is now -1 (since `i` is 0).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `k` still holds true.
