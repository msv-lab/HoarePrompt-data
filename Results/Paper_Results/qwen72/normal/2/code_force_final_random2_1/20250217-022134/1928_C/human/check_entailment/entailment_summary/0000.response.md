### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the number of possible values of `k` such that a given position `n` and number `x` in the line match the described pattern of settling.
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, with the first `k` positions numbered from 1 to `k`, and the next `k - 2` positions numbered from `k - 1` down to 2.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The position `n` and number `x` must satisfy the pattern described.
   - The value `y = n + x` is used to determine the possible values of `k`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - `func_1(q, x)` finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients.
   - The function correctly identifies divisors and their corresponding quotients that meet the criteria.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks if `y = n + x` is even. If it is odd, no valid `k` exists, and the program prints 0.
   - If `y` is even, it calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` using `func_1`.
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` and `x` are within the specified bounds.
   - It correctly handles the case where `y` is odd by printing 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for the given `n` and `x`. The function `func_1` is used appropriately to find the required divisors, and the main logic correctly processes the input and output.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
