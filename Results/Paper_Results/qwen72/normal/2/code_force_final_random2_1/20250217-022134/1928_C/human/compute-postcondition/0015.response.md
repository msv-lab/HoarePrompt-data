Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is a list containing integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, `w` must be at least 2, `i` is 2. If `q` is divisible by `1`, and `q // 1` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` now includes the integers `1` and `q // 1`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- The conditions for `q`, `x`, and `M` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `M` (if `q` is divisible by `1` and `q // 1` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`) was checked before the increment, so the state of `M` remains as it was before the increment.
