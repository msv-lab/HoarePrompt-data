### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Conditions:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` and initializes the answer `ans` to 0.

2. **Initial Check for Odd Sum:**
   - The program checks if the sum `n + x` is odd. If it is, the program prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `n + x` is odd, there cannot be any valid `k` that fits the given constraints.

3. **Function Call and List Initialization:**
   - The program calls `func_1` with arguments `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`, where `y = n + x`. This is correct because it aligns with the problem's requirement to find valid `k` values.
   - The result of `func_1` is stored in `L1`.

4. **Additional Condition Check:**
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, the program calls `func_1` again with arguments `(n - x) // 2` and `x`, and appends the result to `L1`. This additional check is necessary to cover all possible valid `k` values.

5. **Removing Duplicates and Output:**
   - The program converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and then prints the length of the set. This is correct because it ensures that each valid `k` is counted only once.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients that also satisfy the condition.
   - It handles the special case where `w` (the integer square root of `q`) is an integer and `w >= x - 1`.
   - The function ensures that the returned list `M` contains only valid divisors and their corresponding quotients.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the output is accurate for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
