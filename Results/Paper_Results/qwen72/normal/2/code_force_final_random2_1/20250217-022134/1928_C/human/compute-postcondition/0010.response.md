Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is a list containing integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, `w` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, and `q` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` now includes the integer `i`.***
