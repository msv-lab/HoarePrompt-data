The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `M`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).
- `M` is a list containing integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, and `w` must be at least 2.
- `i` is 3.
- If `q % 2 == 0` and `q // 2 >= x - 1`, `M` includes the integers 2 and `q // 2`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged and includes only the integer 2.
- Additionally, `w` must be greater than 3.

After executing the code snippet `M += [i]`, the value 3 is appended to the list `M`.

Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is a list containing integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, and `w` must be at least 2. If `q % 2 == 0` and `q // 2 >= x - 1`, `M` now includes the integers 2, `q // 2`, and 3. Otherwise, `M` includes the integers 2 and 3. `i` is 3.**
