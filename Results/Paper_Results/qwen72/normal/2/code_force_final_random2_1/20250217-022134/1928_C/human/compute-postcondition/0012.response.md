Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is a list containing integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, `w` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `q` is divisible by `i`, `M` now includes the integer `i` and the integer `q // i`, and the current value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.** 

Explanation:
- The code `M += [q // i]` appends the integer `q // i` to the list `M`.
- Since `i` is 1 and `q` is divisible by `i`, `q // i` is simply `q`.
- The condition that `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` is still satisfied.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
