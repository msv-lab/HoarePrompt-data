Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is a list containing the integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, `w` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `q` is divisible by `i`, the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `M` now includes the integer `i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`.
- Since `i` is 1 and meets the condition of being greater than or equal to `x - 1` (as stated in the initial state), `i` is added to `M`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
