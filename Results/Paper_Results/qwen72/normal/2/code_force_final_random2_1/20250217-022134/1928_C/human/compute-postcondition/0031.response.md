Output State: **The program returns the list `M` which contains all integers `i` from 1 to `w-1` that are divisors of `q` and satisfy `i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients `q // i` that also satisfy `q // i >= x - 1`. Here, `w` is the integer square root of `q`, and both `x` and `q` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).**
