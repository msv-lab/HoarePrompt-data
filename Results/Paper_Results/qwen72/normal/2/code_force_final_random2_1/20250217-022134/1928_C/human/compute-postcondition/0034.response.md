The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the expression `factors[prime] + 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `factors[prime] + 1`. If `_` is less than `factors[prime] + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < len(primes)`, `rest` is the value returned by `generate(k + 1)` and must contain at least one element, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is `prime`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and the value `factor` has been yielded. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `factors[prime] + 1`. Since `_` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, it is now `_ + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `factors[prime] + 1`.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < len(primes)`, `rest` is the value returned by `generate(k + 1)` and must contain at least one element, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is `prime`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor` has been yielded.**
