Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is a list containing integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, `w` must be at least 2, and `i` is 2. If `q % i == 0` and `q // i >= x - 1`, `M` now includes the integers 2 and `q // 2`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged and includes only the integer 2.***
