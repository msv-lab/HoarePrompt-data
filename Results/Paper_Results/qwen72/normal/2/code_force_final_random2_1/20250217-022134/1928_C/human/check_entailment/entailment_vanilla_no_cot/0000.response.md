Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, reads the input values `n` and `x`, and calculates the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints. The logic for determining the possible `k` values and the use of the helper function `func_1` to find divisors are consistent with the problem requirements. The program also handles edge cases, such as when the sum of `n` and `x` is odd, which correctly results in an output of 0. The overall structure and implementation seem to align with the expected solution for the problem.
