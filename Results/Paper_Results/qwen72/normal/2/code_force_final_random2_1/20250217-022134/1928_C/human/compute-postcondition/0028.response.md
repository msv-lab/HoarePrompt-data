Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). `M` is a list containing integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, and `w` must be at least 2. If `q % 3 == 0` and `q // 3 >= x - 1`, `M` includes the integers 2, 3, and `q // 3`. If `q % 2 == 0` and `q // 2 >= x - 1`, `M` also includes the integer `q // 2`. If `q % 3 != 0`, `M` includes only the integers 2 and 3. `i` is 3.***
