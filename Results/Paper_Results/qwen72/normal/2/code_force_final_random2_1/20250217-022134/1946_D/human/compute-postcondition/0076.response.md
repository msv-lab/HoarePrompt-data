Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element; `val` is the second element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`; `ai` is `ai` XOR `val`; if `op` is 0 after the update, `t` is a list containing the value `val`; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged; `t` now includes the value of `ai` appended to it.**
