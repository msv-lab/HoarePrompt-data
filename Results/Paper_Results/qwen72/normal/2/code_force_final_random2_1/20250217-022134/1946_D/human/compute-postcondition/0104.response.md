The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`a`, `val`, `op`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The specific value of `cnt` after the increment depends on its initial value, which is not specified.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n-1` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least one element. `val` is the next element in the list `a`. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. `cnt` is increased by 1.**
