Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least two elements, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `t` is a list containing the value `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is an empty list if `op` is 1, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, `v` is even, `op` is now `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`, `ai` is `val` if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `t` now contains the value `ai`.**

Explanation:
- The code `t.append(ai)` appends the current value of `ai` to the list `t`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `ai` is either `val` if `op` is 0, or `ai ^ val` if `op` is 1.
- The list `t` now contains the value `ai` as its last element.
