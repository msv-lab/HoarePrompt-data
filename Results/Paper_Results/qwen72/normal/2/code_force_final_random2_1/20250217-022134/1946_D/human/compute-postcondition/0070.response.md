The code appends the current value of `ai` to the list `t`. The other variables (`a`, `val`, `op`) remain unchanged. Since `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val` before this operation, the new value of `ai` is appended to `t`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element; `val` is the first element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)` and is currently 0; `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`; `t` is a list containing the value `ai ^ val`.**
