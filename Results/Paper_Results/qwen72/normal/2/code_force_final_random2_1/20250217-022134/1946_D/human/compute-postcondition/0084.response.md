Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements; `val` is the third element of `a`. If `op` is 0, `ai` is set to 0, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and `t` is a list that includes the new value `ai` (which is 0). Otherwise, `op` remains unchanged and `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`.***
