Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `t` is a list containing the value `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is an empty list if `op` is 1, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, `v` is even, `op` is now `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is `ai ^ val`.***
