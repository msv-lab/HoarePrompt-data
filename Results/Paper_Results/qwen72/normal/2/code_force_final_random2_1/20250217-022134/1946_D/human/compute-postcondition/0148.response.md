Postcondition: **`u` is now the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is now the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `u` is not 0, and `v` is even, the current value of `v` is non-zero, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, `cnt` is 0, `a` must have at least one element, `val` is the first element in `a`. The current value of `op` is 0.**
