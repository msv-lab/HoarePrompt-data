You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

    return max(ans, len(a))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` processes a list `a` of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and a non-negative integer `x` also less than \(2^{30}\). It returns the maximum value between the length of the list `a` after processing and a computed value `ans`. The value of `ans` is determined by counting the maximum number of elements in `a` whose bits at a specific position (from 29 to 0) match certain conditions. If these conditions are not met, the function may return -1. The function modifies the list `a` during its execution, but the original values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x` is flawed. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
Input:
1
4 2
1 3 3 7
```
**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```
**Actual Output:**
The program returns `2`, which is incorrect.

**Reasoning:**
- For the input array `[1, 3, 3, 7]` and `x = 2`, the program should return `-1` because there is no way to split the array into segments such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `2`.
- However, the program incorrectly returns `2`, suggesting that it can split the array into two valid segments, which is not true.

This indicates that the program's logic for segmenting the array and checking the conditions is not robust enough to handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
