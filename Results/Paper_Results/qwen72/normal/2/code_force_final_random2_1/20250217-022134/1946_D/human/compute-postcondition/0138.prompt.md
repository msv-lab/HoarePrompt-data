Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u` is now the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is now the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `u` and `v` are both 0, the program continues execution.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`u` is now the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is now the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is now `0 ^ (val >> 27 & 1)`, `ai` is `0`, `a` must have at least one element, `val` is the first element in the list `a`, and `t` is a list that now includes `0` as its last element if `op` is `False`. If `op` is `True`, `ai` remains `ai ^ val` and `t` does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> 27 & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ a[1]`. If `op` is `False`, `t` is a list that now includes `0` as its last element. If `op` is `True`, `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is 0, and `val` is the next element in `a`. If the new value of `op` is `False`, `t` is a list that now includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. `a` must have at least one more element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
