Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 29th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation of the 29th bit of each element in `a`, `ai` is the final result of the XOR operation of all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0, `val` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0, and `u` is not 0. Additionally, the current value of `v % 2` is 1, meaning `v` is odd.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that none of the variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and conditions.
