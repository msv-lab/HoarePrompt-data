The only object in the loop head is the list `a`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still have at least one element remaining.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, after the last iteration, the next element in `a` will be the current value of `val` for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least two elements initially, and after the first iteration, it must have at least one element left.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least two elements. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `op` is updated to the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`**.
