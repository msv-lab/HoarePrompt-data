Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).**

Explanation: The code `a = func_1()` updates the variable `a` to be the result of calling `func_1()`. However, since the initial state already specifies that `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and this property is not altered by the code snippet, the output state remains consistent with the initial state, except that `a` is now explicitly set to the result of `func_1()`. The values of `n` and `x` remain as they were updated by `func_3()`.
