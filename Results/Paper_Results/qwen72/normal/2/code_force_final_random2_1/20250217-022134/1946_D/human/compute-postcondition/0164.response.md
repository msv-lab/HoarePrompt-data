Postcondition: ***`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `v` is odd, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the XOR of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `cnt` is the number of times `op` was 0 during the loop's execution, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
