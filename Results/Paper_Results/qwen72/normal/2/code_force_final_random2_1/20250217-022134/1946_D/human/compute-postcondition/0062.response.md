The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement would typically be used within a loop to skip to the next iteration. However, without a loop, the `continue` statement has no effect and the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 29th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation of the 29th bit of each element in `a`, `ai` is the final result of the XOR operation of all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0, `val` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0.**
