The value of `ai` is updated using the XOR operation with `val`. The other variables (`a`, `val`, `op`, `t`) remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ai ^= val` means `ai` is updated to the result of `ai` XOR `val`.
- The initial state specifies that `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. This operation affects `op` but does not affect `ai` directly.
- The condition about `op` being 0 or not does not change the value of `ai` directly, but it affects the value of `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element.
- `val` is the second element of `a`.
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- If `op` is 0 after the update, `ai` is 0 and `t` is a list containing the value `val`.
- Otherwise, `op` is not 0 and `ai` remains unchanged.

After executing `ai ^= val`:
- `ai` is now `ai` XOR `val`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element; `val` is the second element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`; `ai` is `ai` XOR `val`; if `op` is 0 after the update, `t` is a list containing the value `val`; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.**
