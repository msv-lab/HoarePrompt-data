Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element; `val` is the first element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0 after the update, `ai` is 0 and `t` is a list containing the value `ai ^ val`. Otherwise, `op` is not 0 and `ai` remains unchanged.***
