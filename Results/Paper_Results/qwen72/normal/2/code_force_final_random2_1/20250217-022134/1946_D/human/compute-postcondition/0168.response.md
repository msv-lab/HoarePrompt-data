The function `func_5` accepts no parameters directly, but based on the context provided, it operates on an implicit set of parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`), `x` (a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\)), and `a` (a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\)).

The function returns different values based on the following cases:
- Case_1: The program returns -1.
- Case_2: The program returns -1.
- Case_3: The program returns the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state, but it remains unchanged from its initial value.
- Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. Here, `ans` holds the maximum value found during the loop execution, which is the highest count of elements in `a` whose bit at any position (from 29 to 0) is 0, under the conditions specified in the loop. The length of `a` is the number of elements in the list `a` after all modifications within the loop.

Functionality: **The function operates on an implicit set of parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `x` (a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\)), and `a` (a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\)). It returns -1 in two unspecified cases, the initial value of `ans` in another case, or the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. `ans` represents the highest count of elements in `a` whose bit at any position (from 29 to 0) is 0, under certain conditions.**
