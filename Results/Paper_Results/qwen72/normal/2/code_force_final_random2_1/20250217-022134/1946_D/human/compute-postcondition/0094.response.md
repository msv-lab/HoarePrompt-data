The given line of code modifies the value of `op` using a bitwise operation. Specifically, it performs a bitwise XOR (`^=`) between the current value of `op` and the result of the expression `val >> i & 1`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Bitwise Right Shift (`val >> i`)**: This shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions. For example, if `val` is 10 (binary 1010) and `i` is 1, then `val >> i` results in 5 (binary 0101).

2. **Bitwise AND (`& 1`)**: This operation keeps only the least significant bit (LSB) of the result from the right shift. For example, if the result of `val >> i` is 5 (binary 0101), then `5 & 1` results in 1 (binary 0001).

3. **Bitwise XOR (`^=`)**: This operation toggles the bits of `op` based on the result of the previous step. If the result of `val >> i & 1` is 1, the corresponding bit in `op` will be flipped.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least one element.

The code snippet does not modify `a`, `n`, `val`, or `i`. It only updates the value of `op`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least one element.
- `op` is updated to the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least one element. `op` is updated to the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.**
