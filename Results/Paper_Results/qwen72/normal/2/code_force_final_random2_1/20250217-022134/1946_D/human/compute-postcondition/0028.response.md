The code snippet `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. Given the initial state:

- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least two elements.
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `t` is a list containing the value `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is an empty list if `op` is 1.
- `ans` is -1.
- `i` is 29.
- The bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0.
- `v` is even.
- `op` is now `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`.
- `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is `ai ^ val`.
- `val` is the next element in the list `a`.

After executing `ai ^= val`:

- `ai` is updated to the result of `ai` XOR `val`.

Since `ai` was previously 0 if `op` is 0, or `ai` was `ai ^ val` if `op` is 1, the new value of `ai` will be:

- If `op` is 0, `ai` will be `val` (since 0 XOR `val` = `val`).
- If `op` is 1, `ai` will be `ai ^ val` (where `ai` was already `ai ^ val`).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least two elements, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `t` is a list containing the value `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is an empty list if `op` is 1, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, `v` is even, `op` is now `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`, `ai` is `val` if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**
