The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the current value of `ai` to the list `t`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements. `val` is the third element of `a`, and `op` and `ai` have been updated according to the given operations.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **`a`**: Remains unchanged.
2. **`val`**: Remains the third element of `a`.
3. **`op`**: Updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
4. **`ai`**: Updated to `ai ^ val`.
5. **`t`**: The list `t` is appended with the current value of `ai`.

Given these updates, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements; `val` is the third element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`, and `t` is a list that includes the new value `ai`.**
