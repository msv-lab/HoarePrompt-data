Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 29th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is 0, `ai` is the final result of the XOR operation of all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0, `val` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is 0, `u` is not 0, `v` is even, and `v` is not zero.**

Explanation:
- `op` is set to 0.
- `cnt` is set to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `ai`, `val`) retain their initial values or conditions.
