The code `t.append(ai)` adds the value of `ai` to the end of the list `t`. 

Given the initial state:
- `u` is the 28th bit of `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`.
- `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- `ai` is `ai ^ a[1] ^ val`.
- If the new value of `op` is `False`, `t` is a list that now includes `0` as its last element.
- If the new value of `op` is `True`, `t` remains unchanged.
- `val` is the next element in `a`, and `a` must have at least one more element.

After executing `t.append(ai)`:
- The value of `ai` is added to the end of the list `t`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `u` is the 28th bit of `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`.
- `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- `ai` is `ai ^ a[1] ^ val`.
- `t` is a list that now includes `ai` as its last element.
- `val` is the next element in `a`, and `a` must have at least one more element.

Output State: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ a[1] ^ val`, `t` is a list that now includes `ai` as its last element, `val` is the next element in `a`, and `a` must have at least one more element.**
