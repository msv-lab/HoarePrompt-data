Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `val` is the last element of `a`, `x` is updated to the value returned by `func_3()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (denoted as `u`) is 1, `v` is even and currently has a non-zero value, `op` is the result of XORing the bits at position 29 of all elements in `a`. If the final value of `op` is 0, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0; otherwise, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0 minus 1.**
