Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (denoted as `u`) is 1, and `v` is even. If `v` is non-zero, `val` is the last element of `a`, `ans` is the maximum of -1 and `cnt`, and `op` is the result of XORing the bits at position 29 of all elements in `a`. If the final value of `op` is 0, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0; otherwise, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0 minus 1. If `v` is zero, `v` is odd, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
