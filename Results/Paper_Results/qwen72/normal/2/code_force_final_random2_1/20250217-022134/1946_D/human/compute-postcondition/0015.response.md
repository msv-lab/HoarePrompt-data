Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, `v` is even, `op` is the bit at position 29 of `val`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`, which means `ai` is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of `ai` (which was 0) and `val`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
