The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation on the variable `op`. Specifically, it right shifts the value of `val` by `i` positions, then applies a bitwise AND with 1, and finally XORs the result with `op`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Right Shift (`val >> i`)**: This operation shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions. The bits that are shifted out on the right are discarded, and zeros are filled in from the left.

2. **Bitwise AND (`& 1`)**: This operation isolates the least significant bit (LSB) of the result from the right shift. The result of this operation will be either 0 or 1.

3. **XOR (`^=`)**: This operation updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR between the current value of `op` and the result of the previous step.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n-1` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least one element.
- `val` is the next element in the list `a`.

The output state after executing the code snippet is:
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n-1` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least one element. `val` is the next element in the list `a`. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`**.
