Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least three elements, `val` is the third element of `a`, `x` is updated to the value returned by `func_3()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (denoted as `u`) is 1, `v` is even and currently has a non-zero value, `op` is the same as it was before the first XOR operation with the bit at position 29 of `val`, if `op` is 0, `cnt` is 2; otherwise, `cnt` remains 1.**
