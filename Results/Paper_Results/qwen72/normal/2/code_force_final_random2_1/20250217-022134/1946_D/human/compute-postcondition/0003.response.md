To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the range parameters (29, -1, -1). The loop will execute if the range is valid, meaning there should be at least one value in the range.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Range Parameters**:
   - The range starts at 29 and ends at -1, decrementing by 1.
   - This means the loop will iterate from 29 down to 0.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from 29 down to 0.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).
   - `t` is an empty list.
   - `ans` is -1.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - The range (29, -1, -1) is fixed and ensures that the loop will always execute at least once because it includes all values from 29 down to 0.

### Conclusion:
Since the range (29, -1, -1) is fixed and guarantees that the loop will execute at least once, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The initial state of `i` is not explicitly required to be set because the loop will handle it automatically.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will be set to 29 by the loop**.
