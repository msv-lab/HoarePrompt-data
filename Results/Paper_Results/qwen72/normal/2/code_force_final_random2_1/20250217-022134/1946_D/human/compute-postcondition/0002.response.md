Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1.**

Explanation:
- `t` is initialized as an empty list.
- `ans` is initialized to -1.
- The values of `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). This remains unchanged.
