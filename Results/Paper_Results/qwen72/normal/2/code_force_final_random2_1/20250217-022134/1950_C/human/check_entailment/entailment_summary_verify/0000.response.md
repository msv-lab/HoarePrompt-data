### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).

2. **Converting Hours:**
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'AM', and if `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The function prints the time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" using formatted string literals to ensure leading zeros.

### Verification of Edge Cases:

- **00:00**: The program sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM', so it outputs "12:00 AM".
- **12:00**: The program sets `day` to 'PM', so it outputs "12:00 PM".
- **23:59**: The program sets `h` to 11 and `day` to 'PM', so it outputs "11:59 PM".
- **01:01**: The program sets `day` to 'AM', so it outputs "01:01 AM".
- **14:34**: The program sets `h` to 2 and `day` to 'PM', so it outputs "02:34 PM".

### Potential Issues:

- **Redundant Check for `h == 12`:**
  - The check `if h == 12: day = 'PM'` is redundant because it is already covered by the `else` block where `day` is set to 'AM' and then immediately checked again. This can be simplified.

### Simplified Code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h >= 12:
            day = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h -= 12
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 0:
                h = 12
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Conclusion:

The original program correctly handles all edge cases and formats the output as required. The redundant check for `h == 12` does not affect the correctness but can be simplified for better readability.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
