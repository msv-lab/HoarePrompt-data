The code snippet reads a string input in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into two parts using the colon (:) as a delimiter. These two parts are then converted to integers and assigned to the variables `h` and `m`, respectively.

- `h` is assigned the hour part of the input.
- `m` is assigned the minute part of the input.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `day`, `n`, `_`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer.**
