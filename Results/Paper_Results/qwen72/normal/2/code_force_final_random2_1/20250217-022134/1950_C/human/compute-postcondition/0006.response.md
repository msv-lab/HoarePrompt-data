Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `h` is 12, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `day = 'AM'` explicitly sets the variable `day` to the string 'AM'. Since the initial state already specifies that `day` is 'AM', this assignment does not change the value of `day`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is identical to the initial state.
