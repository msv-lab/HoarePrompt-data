Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer.
   - `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer.
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is set to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'AM'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The hour part `h` and the minute part `m` are extracted from the string `s` which is in the format "hh:mm".
   - The conditions for `h` are checked and `h` and `day` are adjusted accordingly:
     - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
     - If `h` is greater than 12, it is set to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
     - Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - The print statement formats the hour and minute parts with leading zeros if necessary and prints them along with the `day`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the formatted time in the form "HH:MM" followed by 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions applied to `h`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:
Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h is the adjusted hour part of the input, m is the minute part of the input, and day is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions applied to h)**

For example, if `s` is "13:45":
- `h` is 13, which is greater than 12, so `h` becomes 1 (13 - 12) and `day` is 'PM'.
- The output will be: **01:45 PM**

If `s` is "00:30":
- `h` is 0, so `h` becomes 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
- The output will be: **12:30 AM**

If `s` is "12:15":
- `h` is 12, so `day` is 'PM'.
- The output will be: **12:15 PM**

If `s` is "09:20":
- `h` is 9, so it remains 9 and `day` is 'AM'.
- The output will be: **09:20 AM**
