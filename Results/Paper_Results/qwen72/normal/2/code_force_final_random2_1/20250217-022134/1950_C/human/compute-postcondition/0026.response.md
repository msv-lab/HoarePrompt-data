Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer, `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is set to `h - 12`. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `day = 'PM'` changes the value of `day` from its initial state ('AM') to 'PM'.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `_`, `h`, `m`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `h` (if `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12; if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is set to `h - 12`; if `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'; otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged) are still valid but not affected by the code snippet provided.
