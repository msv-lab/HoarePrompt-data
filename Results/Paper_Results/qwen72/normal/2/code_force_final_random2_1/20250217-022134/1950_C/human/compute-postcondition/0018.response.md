Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer.
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM', and `h` is set to `h - 12`.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Extracting `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - The string `s` is in the format "hh:mm". We need to extract the hour (`h`) and minute (`m`) parts.
   - For example, if `s = "09:30"`, then `h = 9` and `m = 30`.

2. **Adjusting `h` and Determining `day`:**
   - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is adjusted to `h - 12`.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.

3. **Formatting the Output:**
   - The print statement uses f-string formatting to print the time in the format "HH:MM" followed by the `day` value.
   - `{h:02d}` ensures that `h` is always two digits, padding with a leading zero if necessary.
   - `{m:02d}` ensures that `m` is always two digits, padding with a leading zero if necessary.

### Example Calculation:

Let's consider an example where `s = "09:30"`:
- Extract `h` and `m`:
  - `h = 9`
  - `m = 30`
- Adjust `h` and determine `day`:
  - Since `h` is 9, which is less than 12, `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` remains 9.
- Format the output:
  - The print statement will output "09:30 AM".

### General Case:

For any given `s` in the format "hh:mm":
- Extract `h` and `m`.
- Adjust `h` and determine `day` based on the rules provided.
- Format the output using the f-string.

### Final Output:

Based on the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h is the hour part of the input string s, m is the minute part of the input string s, and day is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described)**

For example, if `s = "09:30"`, the output will be:
Output: **09:30 AM**
