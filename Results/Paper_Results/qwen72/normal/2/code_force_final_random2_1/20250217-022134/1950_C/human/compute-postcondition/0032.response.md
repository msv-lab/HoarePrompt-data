The code snippet reads a string in the format "hh:mm" from the input and splits it into two parts, `h` and `m`, converting them to integers. This impacts the variables `h` and `m`.

- `h` is now the hour part of the input string as an integer.
- `m` is now the minute part of the input string as an integer.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `day`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer, `day` is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions provided in the initial state.**
