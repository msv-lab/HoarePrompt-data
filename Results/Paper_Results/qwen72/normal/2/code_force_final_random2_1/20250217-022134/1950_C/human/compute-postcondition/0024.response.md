Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer minus 12, `day` is 'PM'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `day = 'PM'` sets the variable `day` to 'PM'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
