Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads an integer `n` that indicates the number of test cases. This aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The function processes each test case in a loop that runs `n` times, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

3. **Time Parsing**: Inside the loop, the function reads a string in the format `hh:mm`, splits it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`), and converts both to integers. This correctly parses the input time.

4. **Time Conversion**:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because hours from 13 to 23 in 24-hour format correspond to 01 to 11 PM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.
   - For all other values of `h` (1 to 11), it sets `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because these hours correspond directly to 01 to 11 AM in 12-hour format.

5. **Output Formatting**: The function prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using f-strings, ensuring that hours and minutes are zero-padded to two digits. This meets the output requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `h` is 0, 12, and values greater than 12.
   - It also correctly formats the minutes with leading zeros.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all specified cases correctly and adheres to the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
