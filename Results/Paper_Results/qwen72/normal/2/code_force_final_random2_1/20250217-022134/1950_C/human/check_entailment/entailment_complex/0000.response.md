Reasoning:

The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the special cases for 00:00 and 12:00. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which indicates the number of test cases. This is followed by a loop that runs `n` times, each time reading a time string in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Splitting the Time String**: Inside the loop, the time string is split into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`) using `input().split(':')` and converting them to integers.

3. **Handling Special Cases**:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This correctly handles the transition from 00:00 to 12:00 AM.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This correctly handles the transition from 13:00 to 01:00 PM, and so on.
   - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'. This correctly handles the transition from 12:00 to 12:00 PM.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11, it sets `day` to 'AM'. This correctly handles the transition from 01:00 to 01:00 AM, and so on.

4. **Formatting and Printing**: The program uses formatted string literals to print the time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", ensuring that the hours and minutes are zero-padded to two digits.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases like 00:00 (12:00 AM), 12:00 (12:00 PM), and 23:59 (11:59 PM).

Given the above points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
