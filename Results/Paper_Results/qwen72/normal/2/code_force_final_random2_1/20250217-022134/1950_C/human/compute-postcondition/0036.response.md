Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer minus 12, `day` is 'PM'.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `day` to 'PM'. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `_`, `m`, `h`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `day` while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
