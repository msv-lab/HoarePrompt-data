The code snippet `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` reads a string in the format "hh:mm" from the input, splits it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`), and converts them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm"
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer
- If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12
- If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM', and `h` is set to `h - 12`
- If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'
- Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- `h` and `m` are updated with the integer values of the hours and minutes from the input string.
- The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12. If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM', and `h` is set to `h - 12`. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.**
