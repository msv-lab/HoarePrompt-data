Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer, and `h` is not equal to 0, and `h` is less than or equal to 12.**

The code snippet `day = 'AM'` sets the variable `day` to the string 'AM'. Since the initial state already specifies that `day` is 'AM', this assignment does not change the value of `day`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is identical to the initial state.
