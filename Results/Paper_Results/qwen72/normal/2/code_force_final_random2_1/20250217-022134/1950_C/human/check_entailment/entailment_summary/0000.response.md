Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all given test cases. It processes the input as expected, converting hours greater than 12 to their 12-hour equivalents and correctly appending 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour. The special cases where the hour is 0 or 12 are also handled appropriately:

- When the hour is 0, it is converted to 12 and marked as 'AM'.
- When the hour is 12, it remains 12 and is marked as 'PM'.
- For hours greater than 12, they are adjusted by subtracting 12 and marked as 'PM'.
- For hours less than 12 but not 0, they remain unchanged and are marked as 'AM'.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for all provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
