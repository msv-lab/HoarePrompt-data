### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition is possible, we should output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition is possible, we should output "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1(ch):** This function checks if a string `ch` is a palindrome.
     - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
     - If they are equal, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
     - **Correctness:** The function correctly identifies palindromes for both even and odd lengths of the string.
   - **func_2(ch):** This function determines the minimum number of parts needed to partition the string `ch` such that no part is a palindrome.
     - It uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
     - Depending on the length of the string and whether the first half is a palindrome, it returns a value indicating the number of parts.
     - **Correctness:** The function's logic is flawed. It does not ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic and does not provide the actual partition of the string.

3. **Evaluating the Main Program:**
   - The main program iterates over each test case and attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - **Initial Checks:**
     - `T1` and `T2` are boolean flags used to track the validity of the partition.
     - `a` is used to store the number of parts determined by `func_2`.
     - `x` is used to store the number of parts to be printed.
   - **Special Case Handling:**
     - If the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (`s == s[0] * len(s)`), it sets `T1` to `False` because no valid partition can be made.
   - **Partitioning Logic:**
     - If `T1` is `True` and `func_1(s)` returns `True` (i.e., `s` is a palindrome), it further checks the length of `s`:
       - If `len(s) > 3`, it calls `func_2(s)` to determine the number of parts.
       - If `len(s) <= 3`, it sets `T1` to `False` because no valid partition can be made.
     - Depending on the value of `a` returned by `func_2`, it attempts to partition the string:
       - `a == 0`: The string is already non-palindromic, so it sets `s` to `[s]` and `x` to `1`.
       - `a == 1`: It tries to partition the string into two parts, but the logic is flawed.
       - `a == 2`: It tries to partition the string into two parts, but the logic is flawed.
       - `a == 3`: It partitions the string into two parts, but the logic is flawed.
       - `a == 4`: It partitions the string into two parts, but the logic is flawed.
   - **Output:**
     - If `T1` is `True`, it prints "YES", the number of parts, and the parts.
     - If `T1` is `False`, it prints "NO".

4. **Flaws in the Program:**
   - **func_2**: The function does not correctly handle all cases. For example, if the string is a palindrome, it does not ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic.
   - **Main Program**: The partitioning logic is flawed and does not always produce valid non-palindromic parts.
   - **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as very short strings or strings with repeated characters.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. It lacks the necessary logic to ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic and does not provide the actual partition of the string.

Final: **False**
