Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and its length is at least 1; `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2; the length of `ch` is odd; `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`; `a` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = 2` assigns the value 2 to the variable `a`.
- The initial conditions for `ch`, `b`, and the function `func_1` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `a`.
