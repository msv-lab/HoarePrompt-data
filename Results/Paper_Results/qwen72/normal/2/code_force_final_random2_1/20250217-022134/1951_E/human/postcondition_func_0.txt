The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `ch`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters. It checks whether the first half of the string is the reverse of the second half (or the second half plus the middle character if the length is odd). If this condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. In other words, the function determines if the string is symmetric around its center.
