You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: *`ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters. If the length of `ch` is even, `x` is half the length of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is odd, `x` is equal to `(len(ch) // 2) + 1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `ch`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters. It checks whether the first half of the string is the reverse of the second half (or the second half plus the middle character if the length is odd). If this condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. In other words, the function determines if the string is symmetric around its center.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and its length is at least 1.
def func_2(ch):
    b = len(ch) // 2

If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then `a` is 1. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, then `a` is 2.
    return a
    #The program returns 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the conditions: if the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then it returns 3; if the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, then it returns 4; if the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then it returns 1; if the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, then it returns 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4) based on the length of `ch` and the result of `func_1(ch[:b])`, where `b` is half the length of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 3. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 4. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 1. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 2. The function does not modify the input string `ch`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition is possible, we should output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition is possible, we should output "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1(ch):** This function checks if a string `ch` is a palindrome.
     - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
     - If they are equal, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
   - **func_2(ch):** This function determines the minimum number of parts needed to partition the string `ch` such that no part is a palindrome.
     - It uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
     - Depending on the length of the string and whether the first half is a palindrome, it returns a value indicating the number of parts.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **func_1(ch):** The logic for checking if a string is a palindrome is correct.
     - It correctly handles both even and odd lengths of the string.
   - **func_2(ch):** The logic for determining the number of parts is flawed.
     - The function does not correctly handle all cases. For example, if the string is a palindrome, it does not ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic.
     - The function also does not provide the actual partition of the string, which is required by the problem statement.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.
   - It lacks the necessary logic to ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic and does not provide the actual partition of the string.

Correctness: **False**
