### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition is possible, output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition is possible, output "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1(ch):** This function checks if a string `ch` is a palindrome.
     - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
     - If they are equal, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
     - This function is correct in its implementation.
   - **func_2(ch):** This function determines the minimum number of parts needed to partition the string `ch` such that no part is a palindrome.
     - It uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
     - Depending on the length of the string and whether the first half is a palindrome, it returns a value indicating the number of parts.
     - The function does not correctly handle all cases. For example, if the string is a palindrome, it does not ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic.
     - The function also does not provide the actual partition of the string, which is required by the problem statement.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **func_1(ch):** The logic for checking if a string is a palindrome is correct.
     - It correctly handles both even and odd lengths of the string.
   - **func_2(ch):** The logic for determining the number of parts is flawed.
     - The function does not ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic.
     - The function does not provide the actual partition of the string, which is a critical part of the problem statement.
     - For example, if the string is a palindrome, the function might return a value that does not guarantee non-palindromic parts.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.
   - It lacks the necessary logic to ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic and does not provide the actual partition of the string.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as specified. The program lacks the necessary logic to ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic and does not provide the actual partition of the string.

Final: **False**
