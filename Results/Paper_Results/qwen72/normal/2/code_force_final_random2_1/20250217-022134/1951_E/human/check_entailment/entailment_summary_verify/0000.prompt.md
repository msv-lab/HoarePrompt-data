You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(ch):
    if len(ch) % 2 == 0:
        x = len(ch) // 2
    else:
        x = len(ch) // 2 + 1
    if ch[:len(ch) // 2] == ch[x:][::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False

#Function 2:
def func_2(ch):
    b = len(ch) // 2
    if len(ch) % 2 == 0:
        if func_1(ch[:b]):
            a = 3
        else:
            a = 4
    elif func_1(ch[:b]):
        a = 1
    else:
        a = 2
    return a



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4) based on the length of `ch` and the result of `func_1(ch[:b])`, where `b` is half the length of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 3. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 4. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 1. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 2. The function does not modify the input string `ch`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not fully address the problem description. Specifically, they do not handle the partitioning of the string into non-palindromic substrings as required. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome. However, it only checks the first half of the string against the reversed second half, which is not a complete check for palindromes. For example, it will incorrectly identify "abcba" as not a palindrome.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine the number of parts to partition the string, but it does not actually perform the partitioning. It also has logic that is not aligned with the problem's requirements. For example, it returns a fixed number of parts without ensuring that each part is non-palindromic.

3. **Missing Partition Logic**: The program does not include any logic to actually partition the string into non-palindromic substrings and print the results as specified in the problem description.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
