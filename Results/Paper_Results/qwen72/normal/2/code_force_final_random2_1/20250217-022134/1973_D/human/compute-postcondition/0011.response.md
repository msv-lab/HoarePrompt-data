Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `v` is `return_value`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is defined as `n-1`, if `n` is greater than 0, then `i` will be `n-1`.

2. **Calculate the expression `i * n`:**
   - Substitute `i` with `n-1` in the expression `i * n`.
   - Therefore, `i * n` becomes `(n-1) * n`.

3. **Construct the string to be printed:**
   - The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - The string to be printed is `'? 1 {i * n}'`.
   - Substituting `i * n` with `(n-1) * n`, the string becomes `'? 1 (n-1) * n'`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string `'? 1 (n-1) * n'`, where `n` is the value of `n` from the initial state.

Output: **? 1 (n-1) * n (where n is the value of n from the initial state)**
