To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

This loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is truthy (non-zero).
2. `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` and `k` are such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`
- `cnt` is `k`
- `l` is 1

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **`cnt` is truthy (non-zero):**
   - `cnt` is set to `k`.
   - For `cnt` to be truthy, `k` must be non-zero.

2. **`l < n + 1`:**
   - `l` is 1.
   - For `l < n + 1` to be true, `n + 1` must be greater than 1, which means `n` must be greater than 0.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure:
- `k` is non-zero.
- `n` is greater than 0.

Since `k` is already set to `cnt` and `cnt` is truthy, no adjustment is needed for `k` or `cnt`.

For `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The condition `n // k + 1 >= 1` is already given, but it does not explicitly guarantee that `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to ensure it is greater than 0.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1**
