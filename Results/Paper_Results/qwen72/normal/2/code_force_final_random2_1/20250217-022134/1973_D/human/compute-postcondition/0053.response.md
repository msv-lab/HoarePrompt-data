To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `cnt`**
   - The loop will continue as long as `cnt` is non-zero (i.e., `cnt` is truthy).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must still be non-zero.

2. **Condition 2: `l < n + 1`**
   - The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must still be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusting the States:

- **`cnt`**: Since `cnt` is `k - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 2 (so that `k - 2` is non-zero).
- **`l`**: Since `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`, `l` will be less than `n + 1` as long as `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

### Conclusion:

- `cnt` must be non-zero, so `k` must be greater than 2.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`, which is already satisfied by the condition that `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`**
