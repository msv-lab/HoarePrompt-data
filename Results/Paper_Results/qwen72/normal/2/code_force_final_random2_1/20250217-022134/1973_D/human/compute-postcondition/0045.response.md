To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
     - `cnt` is non-zero (i.e., `cnt != 0`)
     - `l` is less than `n + 1` (i.e., `l < n + 1`)

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`
   - `cnt` is `k`
   - `l` is 1
   - Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

3. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - **`cnt` Condition:**
     - `cnt` is `k`, and `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`.
     - Since `n` is greater than 0, `n // k + 1` will always be at least 1 (since `n // k` is a non-negative integer).
     - Therefore, `n // k + 1 >= 2` implies that `k` must be a positive integer.
     - Hence, `cnt` is a positive integer, which means `cnt` is non-zero.

   - **`l < n + 1` Condition:**
     - `l` is 1.
     - `n` is greater than 0, so `n + 1` is at least 2.
     - Therefore, `l < n + 1` is true because 1 is less than any number greater than or equal to 2.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Both conditions (`cnt` is non-zero and `l < n + 1`) are already satisfied with the current state.
   - No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
