Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `l`**: According to the initial state, `l` is 1.
2. **Value of `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 3.
3. **Value of `v`**: The variable `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value from the given information.

### Output:
Since `v` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact value of `i * v`. However, we can still describe the output in terms of `v`.

Output: **? 1 3 * v (where v is an undefined variable)**
