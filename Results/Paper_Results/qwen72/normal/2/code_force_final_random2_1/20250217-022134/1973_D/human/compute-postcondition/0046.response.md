Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`l`**: The value of `l` is explicitly given as 1.
2. **`i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
3. **`v`**: The variable `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value. However, since it is used in the print statement, we must assume it has some value.

### Output:
The print statement will print a string formatted as `? 1 [i * v]`, where `i` is 2 and `v` is an unknown value.

Since `i` is 2, the expression `i * v` becomes `2 * v`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 2 * v (where v is the value of the variable v)**
