Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. The condition that either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` is still valid.
