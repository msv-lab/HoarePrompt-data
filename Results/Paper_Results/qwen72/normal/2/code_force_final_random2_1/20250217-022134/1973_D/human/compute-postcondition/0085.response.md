The function `func_2()` is called, and since `v` is defined as the last return value of `func_2()`, calling `func_2()` again will update `v` to the new return value of `func_2()`. However, without knowing the specific implementation of `func_2()`, we cannot determine the exact value that `v` will take after the call. The variable `i` remains 0, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `v` is the new return value of `func_2()`, and `n` remains unchanged.**
