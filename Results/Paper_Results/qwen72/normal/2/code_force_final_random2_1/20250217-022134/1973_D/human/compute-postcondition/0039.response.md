To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `l` is equal to `n + 1`.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`. This condition implies that `k` must be a positive integer because `n` is greater than 0.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1` and is also equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, `func_2()` must return `n`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `l` is equal to `n + 1` and `l` is `func_2() + 1`, it suggests that `v` might be related to `n` or `l`.

Given the information, we need to determine the value of `v`. Since `v` is not directly defined, we can infer that it might be a placeholder for a value that is not provided in the initial state. However, if we assume `v` is a variable that should be part of the context, we can still describe the output based on the available information.

Output: **! 1 * v (where v is an undefined variable in the given context)**

This output indicates that the print statement will print the string `! 1 * v`, where `v` is an undefined variable in the given context.
