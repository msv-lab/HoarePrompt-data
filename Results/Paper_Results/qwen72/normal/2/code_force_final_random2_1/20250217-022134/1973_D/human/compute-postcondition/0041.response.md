Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

The return statement is given without any expression, which means the function ends without returning any value. In Python, if a function does not explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns `None`. However, since the question asks for the output state and not specifically about the return value, we state that the program returns nothing.
