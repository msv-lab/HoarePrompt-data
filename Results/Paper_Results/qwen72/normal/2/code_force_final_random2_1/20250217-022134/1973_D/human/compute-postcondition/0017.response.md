Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `v` is the return value of `func_2()` (though `v` is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `n`**: 
   - `n` is greater than 1. Let's denote it as `n > 1`.

2. **Value of `i`**:
   - `i` is defined as `n - 2`.
   - Since `n > 1`, `i` will be a non-negative integer. Specifically, `i = n - 2`.

3. **Expression `i * n`**:
   - Substitute `i` with `n - 2` in the expression `i * n`.
   - Therefore, `i * n` becomes `(n - 2) * n`.
   - Simplifying this, we get `i * n = n^2 - 2n`.

4. **Formatted String**:
   - The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - The string will be `? 1 {i * n}` where `{i * n}` is replaced by the value of `n^2 - 2n`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string `? 1` followed by the value of `n^2 - 2n`.

Output: **? 1 n^2 - 2n (where n is greater than 1)**
