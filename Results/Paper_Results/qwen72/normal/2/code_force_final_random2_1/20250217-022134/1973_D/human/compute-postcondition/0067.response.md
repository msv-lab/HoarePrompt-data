The code snippet `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` by adding 1 to the result of `func_2()`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we know that `l` will be the result of `func_2()` plus 1.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) are not modified by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
