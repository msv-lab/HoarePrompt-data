To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `cnt`: The loop will execute if `cnt` is non-zero.
   - `l`: The loop will execute if `l` is less than `n + 1`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3` (not directly relevant to the loop condition but affects `cnt`).
   - `cnt` is `k` (so `cnt` is non-zero as long as `k` is non-zero).
   - `l` is 1.
   - Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

3. **Evaluating the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, both conditions must be true:
     - `cnt` must be non-zero.
     - `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `cnt` is `k`, and since `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `k` is non-zero.
   - `l` is 1, and since `n` is greater than 0, `n + 1` is at least 2.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `cnt` is non-zero because `k` is non-zero.
   - `l` is 1, which is less than `n + 1` (since `n` is greater than 0).

Given these conditions, the loop will execute the first time without any adjustments needed.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
