Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `v` is the last return value of `func_2()`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

The print statement is:
```python
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables `i`, `v`, or `n`. It simply prints the string `'! -1'` and ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console.

Output: **! -1**
