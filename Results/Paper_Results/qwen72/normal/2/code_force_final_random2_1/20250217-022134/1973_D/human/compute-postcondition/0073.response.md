To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is `while cnt and l < n + 1:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as both `cnt` is non-zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`
- `cnt` is `k - 2`
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

### Analysis:
1. **`cnt` Condition**: The loop requires `cnt` to be non-zero. Given that `cnt` is `k - 2`, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2 (since `k - 2 > 0`).
2. **`l` Condition**: The loop requires `l` to be less than `n + 1`. Given that `l` is `func_2() + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `func_2()` must be such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cnt`**: Since `cnt` is `k - 2`, and `k` must be greater than 2 for `cnt` to be non-zero, no adjustment is needed for `cnt` as long as `k` remains greater than 2.
- **`l`**: Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `func_2()` must be less than `n` for `l` to be less than `n + 1`, no adjustment is needed for `l` as long as `func_2()` remains less than `n`.

Given that the current state already satisfies these conditions (`cnt` is `k - 2` and `l` is `func_2() + 1`), no adjustments are necessary.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
