To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`.
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is a variable that exists in the context where this code is running.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it will be some integer plus 1.
   - `i * v` involves multiplying `i` (which is 3) by `v`. Without knowing the value of `v`, we can only express this as `3 * v`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will output a string formatted as `'? {l} {i * v}'`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `i` is 3.
     - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
     - `i * v` is `3 * v`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? func_2() + 1 3 * v** (where `func_2()` is the result of the function `func_2` and `v` is the value of the variable `v`)
