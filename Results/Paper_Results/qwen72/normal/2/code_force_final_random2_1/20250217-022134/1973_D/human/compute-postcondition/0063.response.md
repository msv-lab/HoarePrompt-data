To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n // k`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n // k + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
- The condition `n // k + 1` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3` (since `i` is now 3)
- `cnt` remains 0
- `l` remains `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
