To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **`cnt`**: The loop will continue as long as `cnt` is non-zero.
2. **`l < n + 1`**: The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `n + 1`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`
- `cnt` is `k - 1`
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **`cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be non-zero.
   - Since `cnt` is `k - 1`, `k` must be greater than 1 for `cnt` to be non-zero.

2. **`l < n + 1`**:
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2()` returns a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cnt`**: Ensure `k` is greater than 1 so that `cnt` remains non-zero.
- **`l`**: Ensure `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

### Final State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is greater than 1 (to ensure `cnt` is non-zero)
- `cnt` is `k - 1` (which is non-zero)
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` (this condition is already satisfied by the above adjustments)

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 1, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`**
