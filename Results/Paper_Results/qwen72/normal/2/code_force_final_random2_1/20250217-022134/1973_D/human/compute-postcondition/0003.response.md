Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `v` is set to 1 (though `v` is not used in the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - The f-string contains the following components:
     - `'?'`: A literal question mark.
     - `'1'`: A literal number 1.
     - `{i * n}`: This is the product of `i` and `n`. Since `i` is set to `n`, this expression evaluates to `n * n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a string that starts with `? 1` followed by the value of `n * n`.

Given the initial state where `n` is greater than 0, the value of `i * n` will be `n * n`.

Output: **? 1 [n * n] (where n is the value of n)**
