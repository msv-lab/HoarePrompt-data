Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains unchanged throughout the loop, so it is still 3.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` is not modified within the loop, so it remains greater than 0.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` is used to initialize `cnt`, but `k` itself is not modified within the loop. The condition `n // k + 1 >= 3` remains true as it was initially.
- **`cnt`**: The loop decrements `cnt` by 1 each time it runs. After all iterations, `cnt` will be 0 because the loop stops when `cnt` reaches 0.
- **`l`**: The value of `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1` each time the loop runs. After the last iteration, `l` will be `func_2() + 1`. The loop ensures that `l` is not equal to `n + 1` when the loop exits, otherwise, the loop would have stopped due to the condition `l < n + 1`.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
