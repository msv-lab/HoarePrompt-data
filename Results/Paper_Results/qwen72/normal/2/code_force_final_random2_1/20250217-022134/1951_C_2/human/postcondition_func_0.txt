The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day (`m`), the total number of tickets to be bought (`k`), and a list of ticket prices for each day (`a`). For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to purchase exactly `k` tickets, adhering to the constraint of buying no more than `m` tickets on any single day. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the minimum total cost for each one, and the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values as described in the initial state, with `k` being reduced to 0 for each test case. The list `a` (renamed to `l` in the function) is sorted and retains its sorted state after processing.
