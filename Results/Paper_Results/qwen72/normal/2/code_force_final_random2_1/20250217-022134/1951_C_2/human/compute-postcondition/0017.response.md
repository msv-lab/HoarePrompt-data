Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now `k * k / 2 + 3 * l[i] * s - 1.5 * s * s`, `k` is now `k - min(m, k) - s`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * l[i] * s - s * s`.
- The code `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` adds `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to `c`.
- Therefore, the new value of `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * l[i] * s - s * s + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, which simplifies to `k * k / 2 + 3 * l[i] * s - 1.5 * s * s`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
