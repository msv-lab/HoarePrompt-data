The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The initial state provided does not directly affect the loop's execution, but it sets the context for what happens inside the loop.

Given the context, the loop will execute if the input (representing the number of test cases) is at least 1. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input must be greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
