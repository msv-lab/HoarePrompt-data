To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to compute `c`.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`i`**: Equal to `n-1`.
3. **`n`**: The first integer from the input.
4. **`m`**: The second integer from the input.
5. **`k`**: Now \( k - n \times s \), where \( s \) is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
6. **`s`**: The minimum of `m` and `k`.
7. **`c`**: Now \( k \times k / 2 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] \times s - s \times s / 2) \).
8. **`l`**: A sorted list of integers from the input.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine `s`**:
   - \( s = \min(m, k) \).

2. **Update `k`**:
   - \( k = k - n \times s \).

3. **Calculate `c`**:
   - \( c = k \times k / 2 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] \times s - s \times s / 2) \).

### Explanation of the Formula:
- **First Term**: \( k \times k / 2 \) is the square of the updated `k` divided by 2.
- **Second Term**: \( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] \times s - s \times s / 2) \) is the sum over all elements in the sorted list `l` of the expression \( l[j] \times s - s \times s / 2 \).

### Final Output:
The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c` after the above calculations. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `l` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(c) (where c is calculated as \( k \times k / 2 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] \times s - s \times s / 2) \), with \( s = \min(m, k) \) and \( k = k - n \times s \))**
