Let's break down the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `k` is the third integer from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user
- `t` is `s + s`
- `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + s)`
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`

Code Snippet:
```python
c += s * (l[i] + t)
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. **Identify the current values of relevant variables:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
   - `t` is `s + s` which simplifies to `2 * s`
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user
   - `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + s)`

2. **Calculate the new value of `c`:**
   - The code snippet updates `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value.
   - Since `i` is 2, `l[i]` is `l[2]`.
   - `t` is `2 * s`.
   - Therefore, `s * (l[i] + t)` becomes `s * (l[2] + 2 * s)`.

3. **Update the value of `c`:**
   - The new value of `c` is `c + s * (l[2] + 2 * s)`.
   - Substituting the initial value of `c`:
     \[
     c = s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + s) + s * (l[2] + 2 * s)
     \]

4. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     c = s * l[0] + s * l[1] + s^2 + s * l[2] + 2 * s^2
     \]
     \[
     c = s * l[0] + s * l[1] + s * l[2] + 3 * s^2
     \]

Output State:
**`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is `2 * s`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * l[1] + s * l[2] + 3 * s^2`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**
