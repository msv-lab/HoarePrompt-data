The value of `k` is decremented by the value of `s`, which is the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is now `k - s` (where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`), `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2`, and the list `l` is now a sorted list of integers from the input.**
