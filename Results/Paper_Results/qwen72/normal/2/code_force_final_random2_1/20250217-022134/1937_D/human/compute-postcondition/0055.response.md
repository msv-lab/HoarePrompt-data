To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial Values:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>').
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>').
   - `suffZero` is updated to include a new element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions).
   - `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.

2. **Evaluate the Function Calls:**
   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` returns a value based on the list `suffZero` and the argument `ol + 1`.
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` returns a value based on the list `suffZero` and the argument `1`.

3. **Calculate `zeroInd`:**
   - `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

4. **Update the Output State:**
   - The only variable that changes is `zeroInd`.

### Output State Calculation:

- `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

### Final Output State:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is updated to include a new element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.
