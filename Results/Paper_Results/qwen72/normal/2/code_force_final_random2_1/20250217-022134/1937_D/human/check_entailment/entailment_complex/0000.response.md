Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the requirements and the implementation step-by-step:

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Grid and Pinball Movement**: A one-dimensional grid with characters `<` or `>`. A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the character and inverts the character after moving.
2. **Queries**: For each cell, determine how long it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
3. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program should handle multiple test cases efficiently.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s1` itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element `times` positions back from the end.
   - It is used to compute intermediate results in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` stores the 1-based indices of all `>` characters in `s1`.
     - `totalOne` counts the number of `>` characters.
     - `preOne` is a cumulative sum list of `pre`.
     - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]` and will store cumulative sums of indices of `<` characters from the end.
     - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to `0` to store the results.
   - **Processing**:
     - The function iterates over the string `s1` from the end to the beginning.
     - For each character `el`:
       - If `el` is `>`, it updates `ans[i]` based on the positions of `>` and `<` characters and their cumulative sums.
       - It updates `preOne` and `totalOne` to reflect the processed `>` character.
       - If `el` is `<`, it updates `suffZero` and `ans[i]` similarly.
   - **Output**:
     - After processing all characters, the function prints the results stored in `ans`.

### Verification:
- **Correct Logic**:
  - The logic for updating `ans` based on the positions of `>` and `<` characters and their cumulative sums is correctly implemented.
  - The use of `func_1` to compute intermediate results is appropriate and aligns with the problem requirements.
- **Efficiency**:
  - The program uses efficient data structures (lists and cumulative sums) to handle the large input size constraints.
  - The time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the string `n`, making it suitable for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required logic and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
