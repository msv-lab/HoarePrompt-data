To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>').
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>').
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains an additional element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions).
- `i` is `k - 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1(preOne, zr)` is called with arguments `preOne` and `zr`.
- The result of `func_1(preOne, zr)` is multiplied by 2 and assigned to the variable `oneInd`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `oneInd` is updated to `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>').
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>').
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains an additional element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions).
- `i` is `k - 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
