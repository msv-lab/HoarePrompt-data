To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

- The code snippet is: `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`
- We need to understand what `func_1` does, but since it's not defined, we'll assume it returns a value based on the inputs `suffZero` and `ol`.

### Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.

### Code Execution:
- `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`

### Impact:
- `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is called with `suffZero` and `ol` as arguments.
- The result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is multiplied by 2 and assigned to `zeroInd`.

### Calculation:
- `suffZero` is initially `[0]`.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- Since `ol` is less than or equal to `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`), and `suffZero` has only one element (0), `ol` must be 0.
- Therefore, `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is called with `suffZero` as `[0]` and `ol` as 0.
- Assuming `func_1` returns the value of `suffZero[ol]`, which is `suffZero[0]` (0), the result is 0.
- Thus, `zeroInd = 2 * 0 = 0`.

### Output State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.
- `zeroInd` is 0.
