Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is complex and involves several assumptions and operations that might not directly align with the problem's requirements. Here are some issues:

1. **Complexity and Readability**: The code is quite complex and hard to follow, which makes it difficult to verify its correctness. A simpler approach would be more appropriate for this problem.

2. **Logic Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the difference between elements in the accumulated arrays, but the logic behind these calculations is not clear and seems overly complicated for the problem at hand.
   - The main function `func_2` uses a combination of prefix and suffix sums, but the way these are used to compute the final answers is not straightforward and may not correctly handle all edge cases.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not clearly handle edge cases, such as when the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid. For example, if the pinball starts at the first cell and the direction is '>', it should immediately move to the right and leave the grid in one second. Similarly, if it starts at the last cell and the direction is '<', it should leave the grid in one second.

A simpler and more straightforward approach would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position and keeping track of the time it takes to leave the grid. This can be done using a loop and basic condition checks.

Here is a simplified version of the solution:

```python
def solve_pinball Queries(t, cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        
        # Precompute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell
        left_time = [0] * n
        right_time = [0] * n
        
        # Compute left_time
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '<':
                count += 1
                left_time[i] = count
            else:
                count = 0
        
        # Compute right_time
        count = 0
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == '>':
                count += 1
                right_time[i] = count
            else:
                count = 0
        
        # Compute the result for each starting position
        result = []
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '<':
                result.append(left_time[i])
            else:
                result.append(right_time[i])
        
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

# Example usage
t = int(input())
cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(t)]
solve_pinball_queries(t, cases)
```

This approach is more straightforward and easier to understand, making it less prone to errors. It also handles the problem's constraints efficiently.
