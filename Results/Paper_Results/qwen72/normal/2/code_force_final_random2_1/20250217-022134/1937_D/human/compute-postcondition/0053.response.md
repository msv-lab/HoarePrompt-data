Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is updated to include a new element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is equal to `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is equal to `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

Explanation:
- The code snippet `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` introduces a new variable `oneInd` which is calculated as twice the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `preOne` and `zr`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific value of `oneInd` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the current values of `preOne` and `zr`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, `oneInd` is expressed in terms of the function call.
