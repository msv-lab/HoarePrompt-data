Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>', `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions). If `el` is '>', `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged, and `preOne` loses its last element. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` contains two elements [0, `i + 1`], and `ans[i]` is updated based on the relationship between `zr` and `ol`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, and `oneInd` changes. If `zr` is greater than `ol`, `suffZero` contains [0, `n`], and `ans[i]` is set to `n - (2 * the sum of the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *Given `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>', `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', `preOne` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre` up to each index, starting with an initial value of 0, but missing its last element, and `totalOne` is decreased by 1. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated to include a new element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is set to `totalOne`, `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr <= ol`, `zeroInd` is set to `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is set to `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is set to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is updated to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>', `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', `preOne` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre` up to each index, starting with an initial value of 0, but missing its last element, and `totalOne` is decreased by 1. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated to include an additional element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is set to `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is set to `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
