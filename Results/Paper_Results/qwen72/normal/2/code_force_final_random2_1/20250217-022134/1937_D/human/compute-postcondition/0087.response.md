Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5). It processes the string to compute a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` represents a specific calculation based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, the function prints the elements of `ans` in a space-separated format. The original string `s1` and the integer `n` remain unchanged. The list `ans` is the final output of the function, reflecting the computed values for each position in the string. **
