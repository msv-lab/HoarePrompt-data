The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1` and `n`. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The length `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. The function processes the string `s1` and returns a result based on the contents of the string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>', where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 5 * 10^5. It processes the string and returns a result based on the contents of `s1`.**
