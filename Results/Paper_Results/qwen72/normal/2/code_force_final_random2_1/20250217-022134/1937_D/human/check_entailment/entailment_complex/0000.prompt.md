Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

# Annotated Functions:
from itertools import accumulate

for case in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    func_2(s1, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing positions, and times is a non-negative integer indicating the number of times a certain operation is applied, such that 0 <= times <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr, times):
    n = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]
    #The program returns the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)` from the end of `arr`. Here, `arr` is a list of integers representing positions, `times` is a non-negative integer indicating how many positions back from the end of the list to consider, and `n` is the number of elements in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` as inputs. It calculates and returns the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element that is `times` positions back from the end of the list. If `times` exceeds the length of `arr`, the function considers the first element of the list. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [(i + 1) for i, el in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        
        if el == '>':
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The variable `n` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. The list `pre` still contains the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`. The variable `totalOne` is now 0, indicating that all '>' characters have been processed. The list `preOne` is empty, as it has been popped for each '>' character encountered. The list `suffZero` contains `n + 1` elements, where each element represents the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string. The list `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element has been updated based on the conditions within the loop, reflecting the final result of the computation.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [ans[0]] [ans[1]] ... [ans[n-1]] (where each element in ans is the result of the computation for the corresponding position in the string s1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5). It processes the string to compute a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` represents a specific calculation based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, the function prints the elements of `ans` in a space-separated format. The original string `s1` and the integer `n` remain unchanged. The list `ans` is the final output of the function, reflecting the computed values for each position in the string.
