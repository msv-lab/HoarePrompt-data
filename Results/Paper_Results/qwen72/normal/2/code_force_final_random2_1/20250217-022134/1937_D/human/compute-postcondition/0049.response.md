The code snippet `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)` appends a new element to the list `suffZero`. This new element is calculated by taking the last element of `suffZero`, adding `i + 1` to it, and appending the result to `suffZero`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>').
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>').
   - `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>'.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions).
   - `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The last element of `suffZero` is accessed using `suffZero[-1]`.
   - The value `i + 1` is added to `suffZero[-1]`.
   - The result of this addition is appended to `suffZero`.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - The new value appended to `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is updated to include a new element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`.**
