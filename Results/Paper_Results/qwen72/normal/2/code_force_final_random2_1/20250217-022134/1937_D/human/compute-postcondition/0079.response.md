To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Values:**
   - `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains an additional element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
   - `func_1` is a function that needs to be applied to the list `suffZero` with two different arguments: `ol + 1` and `1`.

2. **Understanding `func_1`:**
   - Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we assume it returns a value based on the list `suffZero` and the given index. For the purpose of this analysis, let's denote the results of `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` as `val1` and `func_1(suffZero, 1)` as `val2`.

3. **Calculate `zeroInd`:**
   - `zeroInd = 2 * val1 - val2`

4. **Update the Output State:**
   - The only variable that changes is `zeroInd`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State Calculation:

- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>').
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>').
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains an additional element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions).
- `i` is `k - 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

### Final Output State:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains an additional element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.
