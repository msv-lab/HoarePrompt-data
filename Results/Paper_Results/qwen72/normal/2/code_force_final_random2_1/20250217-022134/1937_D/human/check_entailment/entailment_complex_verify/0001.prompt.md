You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

If `times` exceeds the length of `arr`, the function considers the first element of the list. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The variable `n` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. The list `pre` still contains the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`. The variable `totalOne` is now 0, indicating that all '>' characters have been processed. The list `preOne` is empty, as it has been popped for each '>' character encountered. The list `suffZero` contains `n + 1` elements, where each element represents the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string. The list `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element has been updated based on the conditions within the loop, reflecting the final result of the computation.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [ans[0]] [ans[1]] ... [ans[n-1]] (where each element in ans is the result of the computation for the corresponding position in the string s1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5). It processes the string to compute a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` represents a specific calculation based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, the function prints the elements of `ans` in a space-separated format. The original string `s1` and the integer `n` remain unchanged. The list `ans` is the final output of the function, reflecting the computed values for each position in the string.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball placed on a cell will move left or right based on the direction of the cell.
   - The direction of the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of an array and the element at a specific index.
     - It is used to compute the positions of the pinball as it moves through the grid.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function processes the string `s1` and computes the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
     - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the positions of `>` and `<` respectively.
     - The function iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, updating the positions and calculating the time for each starting position.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is initialized with the indices of cells containing `>`.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of these indices.
     - `suffZero` is initialized with a single `0`.

   - **Main Loop:**
     - For each cell from the end to the beginning:
       - If the cell contains `>`, it updates the `ans` list based on the current state of `preOne` and `suffZero`.
       - If the cell contains `<`, it updates the `suffZero` list and recalculates the `ans` list.

   - **Output:**
     - The final result is printed as a space-separated list of times.

4. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles the inversion of the direction after each move.
   - The use of cumulative sums and differences ensures efficient computation of the required times.
   - The logic for handling both `>` and `<` directions is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The logic and data structures used are appropriate for the task, and the output matches the expected results based on the problem description.
