Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>', `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `oneInd`.
- The value of `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific values of `preOne[-1]` and the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` are not provided, so they are represented symbolically in the output state.
