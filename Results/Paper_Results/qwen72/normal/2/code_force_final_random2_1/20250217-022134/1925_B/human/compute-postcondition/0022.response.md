Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 3, and `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the conditions described. If `n` ≤ 3 and `x % i == 0`, `ans` is set to `max(ans, x // 3)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
