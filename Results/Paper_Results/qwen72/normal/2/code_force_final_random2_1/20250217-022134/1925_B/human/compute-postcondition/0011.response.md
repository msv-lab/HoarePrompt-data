Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is set to 1. If `x` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, and `n` is greater than `x // i`, `ans` remains 0. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` remains 0.***
