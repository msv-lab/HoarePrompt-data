Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than `x`. According to the problem description, `n` can be as large as `x`, but the program's logic assumes that `n` will always be less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`. This assumption fails when `n > x`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 6
```
Here, `x = 5` and `n = 6`. The program will not correctly handle this case because it does not account for the possibility that `n` can be greater than `x`. The correct output should be `1` (since the only way to split `5` into `6` parts is to have each part as `1`), but the program will not produce this result.
