Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 2, `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2 and `ans` is initially 0 or 1, the new value of `ans` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
