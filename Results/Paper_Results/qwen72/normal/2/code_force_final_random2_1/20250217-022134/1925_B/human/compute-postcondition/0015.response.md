The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `x // i`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `ans` will be the maximum of the current `ans` and `x // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum of the original `ans` (0 or 1) and `x // 2`.**
