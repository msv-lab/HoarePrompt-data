Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` without any remainder. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to the maximum of its previous value (0) and `x // i` if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.***
