### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems should be maximized.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of finding the maximum GCD is correct because it considers all divisors of `x` and checks if they can form `n` sub-problems.
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` ensures that the loop runs efficiently, as it only checks up to the square root of `x`.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` can be formed with the current divisor `i` or its corresponding pair `x // i`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, when `x` is a prime number, the only divisors are 1 and `x` itself, and the program will correctly output 1 if `n > 1`.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the maximum GCD found for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Final: **True**
