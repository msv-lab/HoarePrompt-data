You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers, `x` and `n`, from the input, where `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8` and `1 ≤ n ≤ x`. It then calculates the largest divisor of `x` such that either `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is less than or equal to `i`, where `i` is a divisor of `x`. If no such divisor exists, the function prints `0`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems should be maximized.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of finding the maximum GCD is correct because it considers all divisors of `x` and checks if they can form `n` sub-problems.
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` ensures that the loop runs efficiently, as it only checks up to the square root of `x`.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` can be formed with the current divisor `i` or its corresponding pair `x // i`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, when `x` is a prime number, the only divisors are 1 and `x` itself, and the program will correctly output 1 if `n > 1`.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the maximum GCD found for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
