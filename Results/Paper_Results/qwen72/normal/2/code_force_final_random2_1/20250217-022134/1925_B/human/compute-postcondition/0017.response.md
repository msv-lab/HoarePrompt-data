Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 2. If `n` ≤ `x // i`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, if `n` ≤ 2, `ans` is the maximum of the original `ans` (0 or 1) and `x // 2`. If neither condition is met, `ans` remains unchanged.***
