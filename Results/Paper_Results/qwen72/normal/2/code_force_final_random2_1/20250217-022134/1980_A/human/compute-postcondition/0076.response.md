Output State: **`p` is 'ABCDEF', `i` is 'F'. If any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F' are not in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m` for each missing character. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`, which is 'ABCDEF'.
- For each character `i` in `p`, the loop checks if `i` is not in the `hmp` (Counter object).
- If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be the last character in `p`, which is 'F'.
- The final value of `ans` will depend on how many of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F' are not present in `hmp`. Each missing character will increment `ans` by `m`.
