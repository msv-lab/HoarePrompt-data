The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `p`. The loop iterates over each character in `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `i` is 'B'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to the next character in `p`, which is 'C'.

State: **`p` is 'ABCDEF', `i` is 'C'**
