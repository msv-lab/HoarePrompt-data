The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively.

- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, but these values are about to be updated by the user input.
- After executing the code, `n` and `m` will take the new values provided by the user input, which should also satisfy the conditions 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5.
- The other variables (`_`, `t`, `a`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are now the integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string input by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` has iterated through all keys in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all characters `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
