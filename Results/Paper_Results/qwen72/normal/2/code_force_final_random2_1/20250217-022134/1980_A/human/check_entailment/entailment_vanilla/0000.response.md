### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counter Usage**: The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`. This is an efficient way to keep track of how many problems of each difficulty are available.

3. **Initial Check for Missing Problems**: The program iterates over the string `'ABCDEF'` (which represents the required difficulty levels). For each difficulty level `i` that is not present in the counter `hmp`, it adds `m` to the answer `ans`. This accounts for the fact that if a difficulty level is completely missing, Vlad will need to create `m` new problems of that difficulty.

4. **Check for Insufficient Problems**: After ensuring all required difficulty levels are accounted for, the program checks if any difficulty level has fewer than `m` problems. If a difficulty level `i` has fewer than `m` problems, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to the answer `ans`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- It correctly counts the number of problems of each difficulty level.
- It correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level.
- The logic for both missing and insufficient problems is implemented correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
