For the given `while True:` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that determine whether the loop should continue or terminate. Since the loop is set to run indefinitely (`while True`), the program state does not need to be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to execute until a `break` statement is encountered within the loop body.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is either 1 or 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 2 or 1. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
