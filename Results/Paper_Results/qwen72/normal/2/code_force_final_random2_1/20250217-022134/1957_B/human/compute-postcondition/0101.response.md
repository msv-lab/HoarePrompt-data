The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` represents the number of non-negative integers to be printed, and `k` represents the sum of these integers.

For each test case, the function needs to generate and return a list of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it generates and returns a list of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it generates and returns a list of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.**
