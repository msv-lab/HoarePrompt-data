Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints the integer `k`. Otherwise, it constructs a list of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`, where the first two elements are calculated based on the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and the remaining elements are zeros. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. **
