Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the value `(1 << i) - 1`, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append((1 << i) - 1)` appends the value `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`.
- The value `(1 << i) - 1` is calculated using the bitwise left shift operator `<<` which shifts the binary representation of 1 by `i` positions to the left, and then subtracts 1 from the result.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `i`, and `temp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
