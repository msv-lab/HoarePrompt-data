Given the `while True:` loop, the loop condition is always true, meaning the loop will continue to execute unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Since the loop condition does not depend on any specific variable values, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2 < k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
