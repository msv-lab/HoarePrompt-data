The code snippet `ans.append((1 << i) - 1)` appends the value `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `ans` was initially an empty list. After the code execution, `ans` contains one element, which is the value `(1 << i) - 1`.
- The value `(1 << i) - 1` is calculated as follows:
  - `1 << i` shifts the binary representation of `1` left by `i` positions, resulting in `2^i`.
  - Subtracting `1` from `2^i` gives `2^i - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `i`, `temp`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), `temp` is \(2^i\), `ans` is a list containing the single element \((2^i - 1)\).**
