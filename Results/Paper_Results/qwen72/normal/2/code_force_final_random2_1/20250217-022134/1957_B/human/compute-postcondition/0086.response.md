The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` could be 0 or 1, so the new value of `i` will be 1 or 2, respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1 or 2, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is 2 or 4. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
