The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` converts the elements of the list `l1` into integers and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from user input

After executing the code:
- `n` is assigned the integer value of the first element in `l1`
- `k` is assigned the integer value of the second element in `l1`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`**
