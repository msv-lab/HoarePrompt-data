Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is either 1 or 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is either 2 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged except for the fact that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
