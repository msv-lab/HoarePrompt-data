Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
