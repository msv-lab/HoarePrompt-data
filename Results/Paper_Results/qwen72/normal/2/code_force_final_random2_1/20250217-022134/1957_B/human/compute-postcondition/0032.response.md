The code `ans.append(k - sum(ans))` adds a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is calculated as the difference between `k` and the sum of the current elements in `ans`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` initially contains the value `(1 << i) - 1`, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\). Let's denote this value as `val`.
- The sum of the current elements in `ans` is simply `val` because `ans` contains only one element.
- The new element added to `ans` is `k - val`.

Therefore, the updated `ans` list will contain two elements: `val` and `k - val`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `i`, `temp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the values `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).**
