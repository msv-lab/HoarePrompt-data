Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is now `temp * 2`. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `temp` is multiplied by 2.
- The conditions for `i` and `temp` remain the same as specified in the initial state. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
