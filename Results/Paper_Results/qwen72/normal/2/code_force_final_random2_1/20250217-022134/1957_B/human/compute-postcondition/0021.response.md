The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`, the new value of `i` will be 2 if `temp * 2 < k` was true, or 1 if `temp * 2 < k` was false.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 2 if `temp * 2 < k` was true, otherwise `i` is 1, `temp` is 4 if `temp * 2 < k` was true, otherwise `temp` is 2.**
