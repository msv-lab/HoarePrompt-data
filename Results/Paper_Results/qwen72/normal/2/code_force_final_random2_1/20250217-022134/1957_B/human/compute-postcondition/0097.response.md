The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` extends the list `ans` by appending zeros until its length reaches `n`. 

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `ans` initially contains two elements: \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\).
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- The length of `ans` is 2.
- The code appends `n - len(ans)` zeros to `ans`.

Therefore, the final length of `ans` will be `n`, and the additional elements will be zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it reached or exceeded `k`, `ans` is a list containing \((1 << i) - 1\), \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), and `n - 2` zeros, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.**
