The code appends the value `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. To determine the new state, we need to consider the current values of `k` and `ans`.

- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- `ans` initially contains the value `2^i - 1`.

Let's denote the current value of `ans` as `[2^i - 1]`. The new value being appended to `ans` is `k - (2^i - 1)`.

Therefore, the new state of `ans` will be `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]`.

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `i`, and `temp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` was no longer less than `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]`, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.**
