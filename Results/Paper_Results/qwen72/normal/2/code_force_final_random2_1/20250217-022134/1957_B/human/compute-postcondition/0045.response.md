For the given task, the `while` loop condition is `True`, which means the loop will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Since the loop is guaranteed to run at least once, no adjustments to the program state are necessary.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1**
