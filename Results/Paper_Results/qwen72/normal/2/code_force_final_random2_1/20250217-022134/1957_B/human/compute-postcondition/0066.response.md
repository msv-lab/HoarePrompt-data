Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` is a list of strings.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` (which is the same as `k`).
- `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` was no longer less than `k`.
- `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros.
- `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `n` and `k` from `l1`:**
   - `n = int(l1[0])`
   - `k = int(l1[1])`

2. **Determine `temp`:**
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - For example, if `k = 10`, then `temp = 8` because \(2^3 = 8\) and \(2^4 = 16\) which is greater than 10.

3. **Determine `i`:**
   - `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` was no longer less than `k`.
   - For example, if `k = 10` and `temp = 8`, then `i = 3` because \(2^3 = 8\) and \(2^4 = 16\) which is greater than 10.

4. **Construct `ans`:**
   - `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros.
   - For example, if `i = 3` and `k = 10`, then:
     - \(2^i - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\)
     - \(k - (2^i - 1) = 10 - 7 = 3\)
     - If `n = 5`, then `ans = [7, 3, 0, 0, 0]`.

5. **Print `ans`:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `l1 = ['5', '10']`.
  - `n = 5`
  - `k = 10`
  - `temp = 8` (largest power of 2 less than 10)
  - `i = 3` (number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` was no longer less than 10)
  - `ans = [7, 3, 0, 0, 0]`

### Final Output:
Output: **7 3 0 0 0** (where `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros)
