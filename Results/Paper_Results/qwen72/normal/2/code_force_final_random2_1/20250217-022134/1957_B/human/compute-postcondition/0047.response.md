Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 2, and `temp * 2` is less than `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `temp` is doubled from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `temp * 2` is less than `k` is still valid as `temp` is now 2.
