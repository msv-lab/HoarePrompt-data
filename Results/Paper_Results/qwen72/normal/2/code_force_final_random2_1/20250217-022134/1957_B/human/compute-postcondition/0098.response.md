Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` (which is the same as `k`).
   - `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it reached or exceeded `k`.
   - `ans` is a list containing \((1 << i) - 1\), \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), and `n - 2` zeros.
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` and `k` are derived from the first two elements of `l1`.
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled to reach or exceed `k`.
   - `ans` is constructed as follows:
     - The first element is \((1 << i) - 1\), which is \(2^i - 1\).
     - The second element is \(k - (2^i - 1)\).
     - The remaining elements are `n - 2` zeros.

3. **Constructing the List `ans`:**
   - Let's assume `k = 10` for simplicity.
   - The largest power of 2 less than 10 is 8, so `temp = 8`.
   - Doubling `temp` to reach or exceed 10 requires one doubling, so `i = 1`.
   - The first element of `ans` is \((1 << 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\).
   - The second element of `ans` is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
   - If `n = 5`, then `ans` will have `5 - 2 = 3` zeros.

4. **Final List `ans`:**
   - For `k = 10` and `n = 5`, `ans` will be `[1, 9, 0, 0, 0]`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 9 0 0 0** (where the first element is \((1 << i) - 1\), the second element is \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), and the remaining elements are `n - 2` zeros)
