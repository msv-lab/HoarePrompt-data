Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This does not affect the other variables or conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `u` and `v` now have specific values provided by the user.
