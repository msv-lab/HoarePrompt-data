Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True.** 

The variable `empty` is set to `True`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u_1`, and `tree`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
