Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque. If `empty` is True, `tree` contains the integers `u` and `v`. If `empty` is False: if `v` equals the first element in `tree`, then `u` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `v` does not equal the first element in `tree`: if `v` equals the last element in `tree`, `tree` contains `v`; if `u` equals the first element in `tree`, `v` is appended to the left of `tree`; if `u` equals the last element in `tree`, `tree` contains `v`; otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.***
