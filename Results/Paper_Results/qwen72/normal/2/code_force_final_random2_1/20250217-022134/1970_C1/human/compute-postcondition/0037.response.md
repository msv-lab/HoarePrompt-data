Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `v`. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains the integer `v`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.***
