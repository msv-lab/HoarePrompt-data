You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, each connecting two nodes u and v where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and it is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The initial position of the stone is given by an integer u_1 where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is `n-2`, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque containing a sequence of integers representing the nodes of a tree structure, with the first and last elements being the endpoints of the longest path in the tree.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is `n-2`, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing a sequence of integers representing the nodes of a tree structure, with the first and last elements being the endpoints of the longest path in the tree, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`. If at least one element in `moves` is odd, the program follows the logic for the if part. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even, and the program follows the logic for the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `edges`, and `u_1`. It returns the minimum number of moves required to move the stone from its initial position `u_1` to one of the two leaves of the tree.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
