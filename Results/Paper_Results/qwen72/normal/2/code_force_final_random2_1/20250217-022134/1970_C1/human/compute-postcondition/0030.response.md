Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing the integers `u` and `v`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `empty = False` does not change the value of `empty` because it was already `False` in the initial state.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u_1`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `tree`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
