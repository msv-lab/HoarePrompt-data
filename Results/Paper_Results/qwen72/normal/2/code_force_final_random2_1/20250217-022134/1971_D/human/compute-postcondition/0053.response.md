Postcondition: ***`s` is the new input string with `len(s)` greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2 (regardless of the values of `s[0]` and `s[1]`), `count` is 2 (if `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]`) or `count` is 3 (if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`). If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `flag` is True; otherwise, `flag` retains its initial value (True if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', or False otherwise).***
