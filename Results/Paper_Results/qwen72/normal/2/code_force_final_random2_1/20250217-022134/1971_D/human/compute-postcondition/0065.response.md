Postcondition: ***`s` is the new input string with `len(s)` greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different minus 1, and `flag` remains True. If `flag` is False, `count` and `flag` remain unchanged.***
