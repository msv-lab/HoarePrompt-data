Output State: **`s` is the new input string, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the length of `s` minus 1, `count` is 1, and `flag` is False.**

The code snippet `flag = False` sets the variable `flag` to `False`. Since `flag` was already `False` in the initial state, no change occurs in its value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is identical to the initial state.
