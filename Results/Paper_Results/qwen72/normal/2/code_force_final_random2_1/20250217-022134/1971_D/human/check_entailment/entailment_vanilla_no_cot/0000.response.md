Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The issue lies in how the program counts the number of pieces required. According to the problem, we need to find the minimum number of pieces such that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. This means we need to count the transitions from '1' to '0' because each such transition indicates a point where a new piece must start to ensure that the final rearranged string is sorted.

However, the program incorrectly increments the `count` every time there is any change in the characters, which is not always necessary. For example, in the string "0110", the program will count three pieces, but the correct answer should be two pieces ("01" and "10").

A correct approach would be to count the number of times '1' appears before the last '0' in the string, as this will give the minimum number of pieces required. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        # Count the number of '1's before the last '0'
        last_zero_index = s.rfind('0')
        if last_zero_index == -1:
            # If there are no '0's, the string is already sorted
            print(1)
        else:
            # Count the number of '1's before the last '0'
            count = s[:last_zero_index].count('1') + 1
            print(count)
```

This corrected version will handle all the test cases correctly.
