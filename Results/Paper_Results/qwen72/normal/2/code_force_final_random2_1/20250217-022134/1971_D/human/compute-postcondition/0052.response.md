Postcondition: ***`s` is the new input string with `len(s)` greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2 (regardless of the values of `s[0]` and `s[1]`), `count` is 2 (if `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]`) or `count` is 3 (if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`), and `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains unchanged from its initial value.***
