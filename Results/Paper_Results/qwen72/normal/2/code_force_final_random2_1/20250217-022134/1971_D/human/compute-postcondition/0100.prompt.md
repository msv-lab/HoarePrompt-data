Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take a single parameter, `s`, which is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') with a length of 1 to 500 characters, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
                j += 1
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is the input string, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is the length of `s` minus 1. If `flag` is True (indicating there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in `s`), then `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in `s` plus 1 minus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of transitions between different characters in `s` plus 1, and `flag` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is the new input string with `len(s)` greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different minus 1, and `flag` remains True. If `flag` is False, `count` and `flag` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *After the loop has completed all its iterations, `s` remains the new input string with `len(s)` greater than 1, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, and `count` is the total number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`. If `flag` is True, indicating there was at least one instance where `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1' during the loop, then `count` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False, and `count` is unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
