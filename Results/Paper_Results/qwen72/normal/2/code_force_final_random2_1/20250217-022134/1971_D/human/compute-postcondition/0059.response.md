Postcondition: ***`s` is the new input string with `len(s)` greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `j` is updated to 4 and `flag` is set to True. The value of `count` remains 3 if `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]`, or 4 if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`.***
