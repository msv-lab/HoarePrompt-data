You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The values of t, n, and m remain unchanged. The loop iterates a times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers b and c from the input. Depending on the values of b and c, it prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'. The variable a is not modified by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `a` test cases, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. It then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or `m` mentioned in the preconditions, and it does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, then Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height. This is correct.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to have a tower with `c` cubes because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has. This is correct.
   - **Case 3: `a % 2 == b % 2`**:
     - This condition checks if the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. However, the parity of `a` (the number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be checking the parity of `b` and `c`.
   - **Case 4: Else**:
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "No". This is correct for the cases where `b` and `c` have different parities.

3. **Correct Parity Check**:
   - The correct condition to check is whether `b` and `c` have the same parity. If they do, it is possible to achieve the desired tower height `c` after `b` moves. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the difference between the initial and final number of cubes must be even if the number of moves is even, and odd if the number of moves is odd.

4. **Output**:
   - The program should print "Yes" if `b` and `c` have the same parity, and "No" otherwise.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('Yes')
        elif b < c:
            print('No')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the parity check condition. It should check the parity of `b` and `c` instead of `a` and `b`.
- After correcting this, the program will correctly determine whether it is possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
