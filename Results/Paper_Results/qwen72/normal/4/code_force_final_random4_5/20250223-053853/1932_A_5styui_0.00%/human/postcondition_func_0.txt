The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `d` and a string `b` from the user. The string `b` is expected to contain characters '.', '@', or '*'. The function counts the number of '@' characters in `b` until it encounters a '*', at which point it stops counting and breaks out of the loop. After processing each test case, it prints the count of '@' characters and resets the count to 0. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the initial parameters `t`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged, and the function has printed the count of '@' characters for each test case.
