Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program has a logical error in the way it selects elements from the `b` array to maximize the difference `D`. The program attempts to pair each element in the `a` array with an element in the `b` array, either from the beginning or the end of the sorted `b` array, but it does not correctly handle the selection to ensure the maximum possible difference.

Here's a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Sorting and Reversing `b` Array**: The program sorts the `b` array in descending order and then tries to pair elements from `a` with elements from `b`. However, it does not correctly handle the pairing logic to maximize the difference.

2. **Pairing Logic**: The program uses a loop to pair elements from `a` with elements from `b` and checks if the difference is greater when paired with the last element of the sorted `b` array. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to pair elements to maximize the total difference.

3. **Incorrect Indexing**: The indexing used in the program, particularly `b[-(n - i)]`, is incorrect and does not correctly access the intended elements in the `b` array.

To correctly solve this problem, you should:

- Sort both `a` and `b` arrays.
- Use a two-pointer approach to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and the largest elements of `a` with the smallest elements of `b` to maximize the difference.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize two pointers
        left = 0
        right = m - 1
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Choose the maximum difference between the current element in a and the largest or smallest element in b
            if abs(a[i] - b[left]) > abs(a[i] - b[right]):
                ans += abs(a[i] - b[left])
                left += 1
            else:
                ans += abs(a[i] - b[right])
                right -= 1
        
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum possible difference is achieved by always choosing the best possible pair from the `b` array for each element in the `a` array.
