### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads and sorts the arrays `a` and `b`. The array `a` is sorted in ascending order, and `b` is sorted in descending order.

2. **Logic for Maximizing the Difference:**
   - The program aims to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \).
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted array `b` (in descending order) and compares the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` with `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (the corresponding element from the end of the sorted array `b`).
   - If the difference with the element from the end of `b` is greater, it sets `temp` to the current index `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If `temp` remains `-1`, it means that the differences with the elements from the beginning of `b` are always greater or equal, and the program appends these differences to `ans`.
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, the program switches to appending the differences with the elements from the end of `b` starting from the index `temp`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of the absolute differences stored in `ans` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Truncation of `b`:** The line `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]` is unnecessary because `m` is already the length of the input list `b`. This line should be simplified to `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)`.
- **Indexing in `b`:** The indexing `b[-(n - i)]` is incorrect. It should be `b[-(i + 1)]` to correctly access the elements from the end of the sorted list `b`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        temp = -1
        
        ans = []
        
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(i + 1)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(i + 1)]))
        
        print(sum(ans))
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as described above.
- **False** if the program is left as is, due to the incorrect indexing in `b`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect indexing in `b`).
