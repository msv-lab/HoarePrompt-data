Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m` and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. It computes the sum of the absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` (of length `n`) and elements of the sorted list `b` (of length `m`, in reverse order if necessary). The function prints this sum for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged, but the lists `a` and `b` are sorted and possibly truncated to the lengths `n` and `m` respectively. **
