### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `M`.

2. **Constraints**: The program ensures that `m` is not greater than `k` by setting `m = min(m, k)`. This is necessary because you cannot buy more tickets per day than the total number of tickets required.

3. **Sorting**: The ticket prices `M` are sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the strategy is to buy tickets on the cheapest days first to minimize the total cost.

4. **Calculation of Minimum Cost**:
   - The program calculates the number of days `q` required to buy `k` tickets by dividing `k` by `m` and taking the ceiling of the result. This ensures that if `k` is not a multiple of `m`, you still account for the extra day needed.
   - It then selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to buy tickets from. This ensures that you are buying tickets on the cheapest days.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days equals `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the program calculates the total cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. The first term `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days. The second term `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is not equal to `k`, it pops the last day's price `w` from the list `N` and calculates the remaining tickets `mu` that need to be bought. The cost is then calculated as `mu * w` for the remaining tickets on the last day, plus the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the remaining `n-1` days, plus the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated cost for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

### Correctness:
The program seems to follow the logic correctly and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. However, there is a potential issue in the calculation of the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days. Specifically, the formula `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` might not correctly account for the price increases in all scenarios.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Case 1**: If `n * m == k`, the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is correct. It calculates the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days and the additional cost due to the price increase.
- **Case 2**: If `n * m != k`, the program pops the last day's price `w` and calculates the remaining tickets `mu` that need to be bought. The formula `mu * w` for the remaining tickets is correct, but the additional cost calculation `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` might be incorrect. The term `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)` should account for the price increases on the first `n-1` days, but it might not be accurate in all cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has a potential issue in the additional cost calculation for the second case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
