### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Conditions and Logic**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling them at the modified price would not increase the profit.
     - The program correctly outputs `n * a` in this case.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`.
     - The formula for the sum of this series is \(\frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)\).
     - The program correctly outputs this value.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1`.
     - The formula for this sum is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is \((n - (b - a)) \times a\).
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
     - However, the program has a mistake in this case. It should be:
       \[
       \text{total\_profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \times a
       \]
       Instead, the program calculates:
       \[
       \text{total\_profit} = \frac{(b - a) / 2 \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n}
       \]
       This is incorrect because the division by 2 should be applied to the entire product \((b - a) \times (b - a + 1)\), not just \((b - a)\).

3. **Arithmetic and Type Conversion**:
   - The program uses integer division and type conversion to ensure the output is an integer, which is consistent with the problem requirements.
   - However, the mistake in the formula for the third case means the output will be incorrect for some test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the first two cases but has a logical error in the third case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
