The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0**
