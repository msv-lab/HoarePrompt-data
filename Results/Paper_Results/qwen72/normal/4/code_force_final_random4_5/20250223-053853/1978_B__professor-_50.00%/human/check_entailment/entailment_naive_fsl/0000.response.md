Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b - a < n` but `b - a` is odd. In such a case, the division `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` will truncate the result, leading to an incorrect profit calculation. For example, consider the input `n = 10`, `a = 5`, `b = 13`. The correct profit should be 77, but the program will output 76 due to the truncation of the division.

To correct this, the program should use integer division more carefully or use a different approach to ensure the correct calculation of the profit.
