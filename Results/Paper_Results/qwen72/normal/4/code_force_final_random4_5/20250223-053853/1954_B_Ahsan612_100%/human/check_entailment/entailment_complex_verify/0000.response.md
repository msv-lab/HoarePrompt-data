### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Variables:**
   - `same` is initialized to 1, which keeps track of the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity), which will store the minimum length of consecutive identical elements found during the iteration.
   - `i` is initialized to 1, which is the index used to iterate through the array starting from the second element.

3. **Iteration through the Array:**
   - The while loop iterates through the array from index 1 to the end.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, it increments `same` by 1.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, it:
     - Increments `i` by 1.
     - Updates `num` to `ar[i]`.
     - Updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Resets `same` to 1.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and the final value of `same`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array `len(ar)`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:

The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the case where the array has alternating elements that can be changed to make the array non-beautiful. Specifically, it mentions that the program increments `i` twice in some cases, which can skip over elements that should be considered.

Let's consider the test case provided in the assessment:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

- **Expected Output:** `1` (removing any one of the `1`s or `2`s will make the array non-beautiful).
- **Program Output:** The program will output `2`.

#### Step-by-Step Execution for the Test Case:
- **Initial State:**
  - `ar = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
  - `same = 1`
  - `num = 1`
  - `minn = inf`
  - `i = 1`

- **Iteration:**
  - **i = 1:**
    - `ar[1] == 2` (not equal to `num = 1`)
    - `i += 1` (i = 2)
    - `num = 2`
    - `minn = min(inf, 1) = 1`
    - `same = 1`
  - **i = 2:**
    - `ar[2] == 1` (not equal to `num = 2`)
    - `i += 1` (i = 3)
    - `num = 1`
    - `minn = min(1, 1) = 1`
    - `same = 1`
  - **i = 3:**
    - `ar[3] == 2` (not equal to `num = 1`)
    - `i += 1` (i = 4)
    - `num = 2`
    - `minn = min(1, 1) = 1`
    - `same = 1`
  - **i = 4:**
    - `ar[4] == 1` (not equal to `num = 2`)
    - `i += 1` (i = 5)
    - `num = 1`
    - `minn = min(1, 1) = 1`
    - `same = 1`
  - **Final Update:**
    - `minn = min(1, 1) = 1`

- **Output:**
  - `minn` is 1, which is not equal to `inf` or `len(ar) = 5`.
  - The program prints `1`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The program does correctly handle the case where the array has alternating elements. It correctly identifies that the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is `1` for the test case `1 2 1 2 1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True** (The given program is correct).
