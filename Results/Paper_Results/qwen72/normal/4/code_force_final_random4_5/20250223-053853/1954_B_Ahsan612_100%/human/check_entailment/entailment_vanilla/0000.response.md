### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array is one where we can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

2. **Identifying Key Conditions:**
   - If the array consists of all the same elements, it is impossible to make it stop being beautiful by removing elements. Hence, the output should be \(-1\).
   - If the array has at least one segment where the elements are not all the same, we can remove elements to break the beauty condition.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` to the minimum of the current `same` count and the previous `minn`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

4. **Checking for Correctness:**
   - The program correctly identifies if the array consists of all the same elements by checking if `minn` is `inf` or equal to the length of the array.
   - However, the logic for updating `minn` and `same` is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the transition between different segments of the array.
   - Specifically, the line `i += 1` before `num = ar[i]` and `minn = min(minn, same)` can cause an index out of range error if `i` is already at the last element of the array.
   - Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple segments of different elements. It should count the minimum length of any segment of consecutive elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition.

5. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - We need to iterate through the array and count the length of each segment of consecutive elements.
   - We should keep track of the minimum length of these segments.
   - If the minimum segment length is 1 or the array has only one unique element, it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful, so we output \(-1\).
   - Otherwise, we output the minimum segment length.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        min_segment_length = float('inf')
        same = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == ar[i - 1]:
                same += 1
            else:
                min_segment_length = min(min_segment_length, same)
                same = 1
        min_segment_length = min(min_segment_length, same)
        
        if min_segment_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_segment_length)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Set Check:** `if len(set(ar)) == 1:` checks if all elements in the array are the same. If true, it prints \(-1\) and continues to the next test case.
- **Segment Length Calculation:** The program iterates through the array, counting the length of each segment of consecutive elements.
- **Minimum Segment Length:** It updates `min_segment_length` with the minimum length of any segment found.
- **Final Check:** After the loop, it checks if the minimum segment length is equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length.
