Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful and has alternating elements that can be changed to make the array non-beautiful. The logic for updating `minn` and `same` is indeed flawed. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incrementing `i` Twice**: The program increments `i` twice in some cases, which can skip over elements that should be considered. This is evident in the loop where `i` is incremented both inside the `else` block and at the end of the loop. This can cause the program to skip elements and miss the correct minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Handling Alternating Elements**: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has alternating elements that can be changed to make the array non-beautiful. For example, in the test case:
   ```
   5
   1 2 1 2 1
   ```
   The expected output is `1`, as removing any one of the `1`s or `2`s will make the array non-beautiful. However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly updates `minn` and `same`.

3. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach should involve checking the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property. This can be done by identifying the longest subsequence of identical elements and ensuring that removing elements from this subsequence will make the array non-beautiful.

Given these issues, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is not correct.

Final: **False**
