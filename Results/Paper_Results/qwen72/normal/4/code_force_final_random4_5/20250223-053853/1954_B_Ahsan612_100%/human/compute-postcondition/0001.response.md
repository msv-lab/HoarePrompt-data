Output State: **The loop processes each test case and prints the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array `ar` for each test case. If the array consists of all identical elements or is empty, it prints `-1`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` retain their initial values, but the internal variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are reset for each test case.**
