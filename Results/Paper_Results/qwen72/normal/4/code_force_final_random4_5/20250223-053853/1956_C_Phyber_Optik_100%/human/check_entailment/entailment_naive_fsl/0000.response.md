Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum for all potential cases. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the sum is incorrect. The sum should be the maximum possible sum of all elements in the matrix, which is the sum of all integers from 1 to n, repeated n times. The correct maximum sum for an n√ón matrix is \( n \times \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

For example, for \( n = 2 \), the maximum sum should be \( 2 \times \frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \), but the program outputs 7, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the operations generated by the program do not always result in the maximum sum. The operations should fill the matrix with the maximum possible values, but the current operations do not achieve this for all cases. For instance, for \( n = 2 \), the operations generated by the program do not fill the matrix with the values [2, 2] and [2, 2], which would be the correct configuration to achieve the maximum sum of 6.
