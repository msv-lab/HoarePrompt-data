Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program calculates the maximum sum of the matrix and prints the operations, but it does not correctly compute the maximum sum for the matrix. The formula used in the program to calculate the sum is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an n x n matrix, where each row and column can be filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, is \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \). This is because the maximum value each cell can hold is n, and the sum of a permutation from 1 to n is \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

Additionally, the operations printed by the program do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum. The program prints operations that set each row and column to the same permutation [1, 2, ..., n], which does not maximize the sum. To maximize the sum, each row and each column should ideally be a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], but the specific permutations used in the operations should ensure that each cell contains the highest possible value, which is n.

A correct approach would be to use a permutation of [n, n-1, ..., 1] for both row and column operations to ensure that each cell in the matrix is filled with the highest possible value, n, thus achieving the maximum sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, j, *range(n, 0, -1))
            print(2, j, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and prints the operations that will fill the matrix with the highest possible values to achieve this sum.
