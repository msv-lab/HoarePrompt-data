Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 500`. It calculates a sum based on the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`, and prints this sum along with `2 * n`. Additionally, for each `j` from 1 to `n`, it prints two lines: the first line contains `1`, `n - j + 1`, and a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`, and the second line contains `2`, `n - j + 1`, and the same sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variable `t` remains an integer such that `1 <= t <= 500`. **
