Output State: **The variable `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, the variable `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500. The loop prints the value of `sum` and `2 * n` for each test case, followed by two lines of output for each `j` from 1 to `n`, each line containing `1` or `2`, `n - j + 1`, and a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `sum` for each test case is calculated as the sum of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` from 2 to `n`, and then printed along with `2 * n`.**
