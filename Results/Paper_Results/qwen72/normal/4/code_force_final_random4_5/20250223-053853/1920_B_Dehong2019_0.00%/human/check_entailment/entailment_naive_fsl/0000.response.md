Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Alice can remove elements to optimize the final sum. The current implementation only considers the scenario where Bob multiplies the smallest elements by -1, but it does not account for the optimal strategy of Alice to remove the smallest elements first, which could significantly affect the final sum.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
5 2 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case, the optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the two smallest elements (1 and 2), leaving the array as `[3, 4, 5]`. Bob can then multiply the smallest remaining element (3) by -1, resulting in the array `[3, 4, -5]` and a final sum of `3 + 4 - 5 = 2`.

However, the given program will not handle this case correctly. It will sort the array in descending order and then apply Bob's operations, leading to an incorrect result.
