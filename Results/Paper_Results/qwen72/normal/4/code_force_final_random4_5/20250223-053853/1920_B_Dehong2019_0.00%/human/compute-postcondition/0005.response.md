Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a modified sum of the elements in `a`. The modifications involve subtracting twice the value of the first `x` elements and then adding the value of the first `k` elements while subtracting twice the value of the elements at positions `x + 1` to `k + x` (if they exist). The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and their final state is undefined after the function completes. **
