The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique integers in `a` where each integer is considered in its complement form (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`). The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the complement counts of the integers in `a`, but the final state of `count` is not relevant to the user. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` or `a`.
