Postcondition: **`N` is an integer, `M1` is an integer, `M2` is an integer, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers provided by the input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. Either `M1` is less than or equal to 1, or `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`.**
