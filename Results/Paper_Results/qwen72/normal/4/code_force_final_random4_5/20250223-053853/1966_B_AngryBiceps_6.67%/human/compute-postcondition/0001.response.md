Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases, and for each test case, it has printed 'NO' if the first row or the first column contains only one unique color and that color is different from the last row or the last column, respectively. Otherwise, it has printed 'YES'. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and their final values after the loop are undefined as they are overwritten in each iteration.**
