The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an n x m grid represented as a list of strings with characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, the function checks if the first row or the first column contains only one unique color and that color is different from the last row or the last column, respectively. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results, one per test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' result has been printed for each. The internal variables used for processing are reset for each test case and are undefined after the function completes.
