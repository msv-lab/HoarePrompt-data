### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations.
   - An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in a list \( a \).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The program constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
     - `first_row` is a concatenation of the first character of each row.
     - `last_row` is a concatenation of the last character of each row.
   - The program checks if the first row is entirely one color and different from the last row. If so, it prints "NO".
   - The program checks if the first column (constructed from the first characters of each row) is entirely one color and different from the last column (constructed from the last characters of each row). If so, it prints "NO".
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "YES".

4. **Analysis of Conditions**:
   - **First Row and Last Row Check**:
     - If the first row is entirely one color and different from the last row, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the first row cannot influence the last row if they are different.
   - **First Column and Last Column Check**:
     - If the first column is entirely one color and different from the last column, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the first column cannot influence the last column if they are different.
   - **Other Cases**:
     - If the first row or first column is not entirely one color, or if they are the same color as the last row or last column, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the operations can be used to propagate the color from the first row/column to the rest of the grid.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **1x1 Grid**:
     - The program correctly handles a \( 1 \times 1 \) grid by printing "YES" if the single square is the same color.
   - **Uniform Grid**:
     - The program correctly handles cases where the grid is already the same color by printing "YES".

6. **Function Summary Validation**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func`.
   - The function processes all test cases and prints the appropriate "YES" or "NO" result for each.
   - The internal variables are reset for each test case, and the program correctly handles multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies situations where the grid cannot be made uniform due to the constraints of the operations. The conditions it checks are sufficient to determine if the grid can be made uniform.

Final: **True**
