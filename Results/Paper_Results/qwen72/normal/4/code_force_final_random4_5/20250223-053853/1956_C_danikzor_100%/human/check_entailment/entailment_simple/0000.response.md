Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. However, the loop for the test cases is implemented incorrectly as `for t in range(t, 0, -1)`, which should be `for _ in range(t)` to iterate `t` times.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but it correctly reads the size of the matrix `n` from the input within the function. This is a valid approach, but it would be more conventional to pass `n` as a parameter to `func_1`.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix is calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is correct for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and their permutations.
   - The number of operations is set to `2 * n`, which is within the allowed limit of no more than `2n` operations.

4. **Operations**:
   - The program performs `2n` operations, alternating between Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, it first performs a Type 1 operation on row `i` using the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - Then, it performs a Type 2 operation on column `i` using the same permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

5. **Matrix State**:
   - After the first Type 1 operation on row `i`, the row will be filled with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - After the first Type 2 operation on column `i`, the column will be filled with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix will eventually be assigned the maximum possible value, which is `n`.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct, with the first line containing the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - Each subsequent line correctly describes the operation type, the row or column index, and the permutation used.

Given the above points, the program is logically correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement. However, the loop for handling multiple test cases is implemented incorrectly.

Correctness: **False**

The reason for the incorrectness is the loop for handling multiple test cases, which should be `for _ in range(t)` instead of `for t in range(t, 0, -1)`. This will ensure that the program processes the correct number of test cases.
