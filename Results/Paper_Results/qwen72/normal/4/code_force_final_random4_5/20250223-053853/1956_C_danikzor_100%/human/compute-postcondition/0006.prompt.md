You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a matrix and operations on it, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will print two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`. The first line will contain `1`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1`. The second line will contain `2`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1`. The variable `i` will have iterated through all values from 1 to `n`, and the loop will have completed its execution. The state of the other variables, such as `t` and `n`, remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `n` (the size of the matrix for each test case). The exact return value is not specified, but it is likely to return a result based on operations performed on the matrices for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
