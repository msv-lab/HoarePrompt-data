You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a matrix and operations on it, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will print two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`. The first line will contain `1`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1`. The second line will contain `2`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1`. The variable `i` will have iterated through all values from 1 to `n`, and the loop will have completed its execution. The state of the other variables, such as `t` and `n`, remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations involve either setting a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The provided solution initializes the matrix with zeroes and then performs \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation sets a row or a column to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum of the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Since each row and each column is set to this permutation, the total sum of the matrix after \( 2n \) operations is \( 2n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n^2(n+1) \).

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum as \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) // 6 \).
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula for the maximum sum should be \( n^2(n+1) \).

5. **Operation Verification**:
   - The program correctly prints \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation is of type 1 or type 2, and the permutation used is \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), which is valid.

6. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula for the maximum sum is \( n^2(n+1) \).

Given the incorrect sum formula, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
