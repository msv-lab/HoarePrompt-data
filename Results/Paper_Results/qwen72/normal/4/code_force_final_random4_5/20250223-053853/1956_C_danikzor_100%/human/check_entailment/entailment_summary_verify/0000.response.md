### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, `func_1` reads the integer `n` and prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula for the maximum sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix where each row and column is filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Operations:**
   - The program prints `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit of no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation is of type 1 or type 2, and the permutations used are from `n` down to `1` in reverse order.
   - These operations correctly fill the matrix with permutations, but the sum calculation is flawed.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     - Correct maximum sum: \( 1 \).
     - Program output: `1 1` and `1 1 1`, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - Correct maximum sum: \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 6 \).
     - Program output: `7 3` and the operations:
       - `1 1 2 1`
       - `1 2 2 1`
       - `2 1 2 1`
     - The operations will fill the matrix as follows:
       - After the first operation: \(\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\)
       - After the second operation: \(\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\)
       - After the third operation: \(\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\)
     - The sum of the matrix is \( 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6 \), which is correct, but the program incorrectly prints `7` as the maximum sum.

### Final Evaluation:
- The operations performed by the program are correct and will fill the matrix as required.
- However, the sum calculation is incorrect, leading to the wrong output for the maximum sum.

Final: **False**
