Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a matrix and operations on it, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters.
- The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
- `n` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is an input integer, which means it is provided by the user or another part of the program. The exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, but it is an integer.

2. **Expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`**:
   - This is a mathematical formula that calculates a value based on `n`.
   - The formula is \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1)}{6} \).
   - The result of this expression will be an integer because the division is integer division (`//`).

3. **Expression `2 * n`**:
   - This is a simple multiplication of `n` by 2.
   - The result will be an integer.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output two values separated by a comma:
- The first value is the result of the expression \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1)}{6} \).
- The second value is the result of the expression \( 2 \cdot n \).

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
