Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user input and prints a pair of values: the first value is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, and the second value is `2 * n`. It then prints two lines for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`. Each line starts with either `1` or `2`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1` in reverse order. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that the input integer `n` has been processed, and the specified output has been printed to the console. **
