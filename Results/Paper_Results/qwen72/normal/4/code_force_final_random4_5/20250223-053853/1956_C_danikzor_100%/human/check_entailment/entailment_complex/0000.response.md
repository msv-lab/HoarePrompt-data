Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. However, the function `func_1` is called in a loop that decrements `t` from the total number of test cases to 0, which is not the standard way to handle test cases. Typically, you would increment from 0 to `t-1` or use a while loop to handle each test case. This could lead to confusion, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution as long as `func_1` is called the correct number of times.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal. It should take `n` as a parameter to make it more modular and clear. However, since the function reads `n` from the input inside the function, it still works correctly.

3. **Maximum Sum Calculation**: The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is used to calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix. This formula is correct for the given problem. The sum of all elements in the matrix after performing the operations will be the sum of the first `n` natural numbers multiplied by `n` (since each number from 1 to `n` will appear exactly `n` times in the matrix).

4. **Operation Output**: The function prints `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit of `2n` operations. Each operation is of type 1 or type 2, and the permutations used are valid (they are the integers from `n` down to 1, which is a valid permutation).

5. **Operation Description**: The operations are described correctly:
   - Type 1 operation: `1 i *range(n, 0, -1)` assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to the `i`-th row.
   - Type 2 operation: `2 i *range(n, 0, -1)` assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to the `i`-th column.

6. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem requirements. For each test case, the program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the detailed operations.

Given the above points, the program is logically correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
