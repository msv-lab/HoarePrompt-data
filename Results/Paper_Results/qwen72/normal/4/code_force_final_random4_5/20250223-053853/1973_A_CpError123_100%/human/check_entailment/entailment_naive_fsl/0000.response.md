Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the maximum number of draws in some scenarios. Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

In this case, the scores of all three players are the same, which implies that either no games were played or all games ended in draws. However, since each game awards a total of 2 points (2 for a win, 0 for a loss, or 1 for each in a draw), the total number of points must be even. For 3 games to end in draws, the total points would be 3 * 2 = 6, which is consistent with the input. However, the problem states that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times, and it is guaranteed that \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \). Given that the total points are 9 (3 + 3 + 3), which is odd, it is impossible for all games to end in draws. Therefore, the correct output should be -1, but the program outputs 3, which is incorrect.
